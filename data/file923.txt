9230012 the timing is at least it appears now it will be there monday that just demonstrates god is on our side
9230013 we will have to accept losses this machine will immediately explode

9230016 what can we use to entice people to church and how can we show the youth of america that jesus is a the change of bible versions was not proving successful enough and the dumbing down of theology to the level of rank liberalism was not proving to be the ticket either
9230017 when outreach is your stated purpose you will go to any lengths to justify almost anything in attempting to reach the lost
9230018 we will let you have our youth on sunday but you have to use our methods to get them there
9230019 we hear relatively little preaching on jesus as the second adam mainly because most christian leaders have not been strongly tuned in to the
9230020 victorious eschatology makes a convincing argument that the biblical prophecies concerning the
9230021 the first thing god said to adam and eve was
9230022 before his fall in heaven satan or lucifer had both power and authority
9230023 i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god
9230024 this may sound strange at first but think about it god gave adam the authority to give his authority over to satan adam passed over to satan the authority to take dominion over gods creation worse yet adam put himself and the whole future human race under the authority of satan as well
9230025 if gods plan for history suddenly changed with the first adam in the garden of eden it just as suddenly changed back with the coming of the second and last adam jesus christ
9230026 there is also what i like to think of as an apostolic dimension to jesus death on the cross joesph mattera puts it this way was not so that you can go to heaven the main purpose of his death was so that his kingdom can be established in you so that as a result on the earth luke 17 21 and reconcile the world back to him
9230027 god sent jesus in true human flesh to do what adam failed to do
9230028 for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil
9230029 we have seen that the second adam jesus christ came to seek and to save that which was lost meaning the first adams loss of the
9230030 the second adam did all that was necessary to put back in place gods original design for the earth as a colony of heaven once he did he then delegated the responsibility of bringing gods plan into being
9230031 he puts an end to all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet
9230032 it is our task to become spiritual and social activists until satans dominion is ended
9230033 what is theology what are we talking about what is theology anyway here is my attempt at a definition theology is a human attempt to explain gods word and gods works in a reasonable and systematic way this is not a traditional definition for one thing it considers gods works as one valid source of theological information for another it see gods word as both what is written in the bible logos as well as what god is currently revealing rhea admittedly a downside of viewing theology in this way is possible subjectivity but the upside is more relevance to what the spirit is currently saying teachers research and expound the logos prophets bring the rhema and apostles put it together and point the direction into the future

9230043 jesse never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent after spending great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now jesse has no choice but to look ahead to week 5

9230045 you cant say its the economy because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out one possibility bandied about is that audiences are too nostalgic for holmes dawsons creek persona to clamor for tickets its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter

9230049 ensure we have up to date figures that will help us better target the help we provide for veterans in prison
9230050 effectively when armed personnel return there is no help for them
9230051 contrasts greatly with the way the united states provide counselling and assistance to their armed personnel
9230052 i have come to the conclusion that if proper treatment was available for these disturbed servicemen hundreds if not thousands would not have offended
9230053 the government is letting them and their families down very badly indeed
9230054 as many as 8 500 former soldiers are currently in custody in the uk
9230055 there is no systematic availability of stress related counselling this should be made available without delay and would drastically reduce the number of receptions into custody
9230056 the mod works closely with the service charities to support veterans when they leave the armed forces and for those who find themselves in prison
9230057 the prison in reach initiative already provides advice on the support available to veterans before and after their release robust systems are in place to treat and prevent ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and other stress disorders

9230085 since 1926 three years before the depression the stock market has returned an average of about 10 percent annually
9230086 six percent for mortgage interest saved is pretty good ten percent isnt bad either both should be carefully considered
9230087 in january i paid off the 30 year adjustable rate mortgage that i took out to buy my home in1997 it took 10 years and 5 months and wasnt that hard to do i feel great
9230088 as i watch the foreclosure storm raging around me i know that i have nothing to worry about banks are more than happy to extend me a line of credit since ive got a 100 percent paid in full property with the market in the tank and my bank account flush with cash i can snap up great deals that in five to 10 years will be paying me back in spades
9230089 the benefit weve seen since paying off our mortgage is that we have been able to invest the freed up cash to max out our 401 k s which we were not able to do before even though we dont get the mortgage tax deduction we do get the deduction from investing in our 401 k s
9230090 i paid extra on my mortgage every month for years sometimes double payments i got laid off and had trouble making the payments and the bank absolutely did not care about my past payment history all they were concerned about was the last three months i had tons of equity in the house but couldnt tap it because i wasnt working i got out of it but it was a terrible position to be in

9230342 the debate between those who believe in doing everything including a military operation to prevent iran from getting a nuclear bomb and those who think we can live with iranian nukes has been settled
9230343 if the ayatollahs regime does not fall in the next year if the americans do not strike militarily and if the international sanctions do not break the iranian nuclear plan israel will have to act forcefully

9230347 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions for the benefit of troops under the auspices of education officer

9230378 welcome mr teacher heres the new keys to your trailer dont worry about the students because we know theyre prone to failure and it never is a problem if the students get too bored as long as you have a word wall and an instructional board oh and never show a movie where someone was a sword the only things we fear are a law suit and the lord and dont tolerate a student if they have something to prove cause if we drive them out of school then our test scores will improve well they say you went to harvard so ill leave you to your task just dont ask for more resources cause it only makes us laugh
9230379 but i have a yeast infection my bladders bigger than a lake how many more excuses am i gonna have to make fuck your class mr teacher i know everything already martin luther king freed the slaves back in 1970
9230380 no way i got million dollar lyrics to sell im the next american idol ill play for the nfl
9230381 whoah there mr teacher dont say that to the students if you want to keep your job that type of talk just isnt prudent youll get called a trouble maker and youll probably get fired keep your problems to yourself until after youve retired
9230382 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
9230383 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
9230384 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
9230385 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
9230386 we should pray for revival because we cannot endure the dishonour of god caused by the worldliness of the church the sins of unbelievers and the proud unbelief of the day so that god may be glorified y the outpouring of his spirit on the church of christ
9230387 if there is anything that is constantly coming up in your moments of close communion with god that is the thing that hinders prayer put it away
9230388 every child of god who wants to make the most out of his life for christ should set apart the first part of the day to meet with god in the study of his word and prayer the secret place of prayer is the place to fight our battles and gain our victories
9230389 our whole life should be a life of prayer we should walk in constant communion with god there should be a constant looking upward to god we should walk so habitually in his presence that even when we awake in the night it would be the most natural thing for us to speak to him in thanksgiving or petition
9230390 satan is perfectly willing that the church multiply its organizations and contrive machinery for the conquest of the world for christ if it will only give up praying

9230414 we want to see quality and diversity certainly the fairfax newspapers are part of our quality and diversity across the system and anything that would lead to a reduction either in the quality of those newspapers or in the diversity of views in our media market is of concern to me
9230415 theres never been an industrial dispute in this country that wasnt solved by talking
9230416 there are always rules there are always technicalities there are always complexities but at the end of the day what solves industrial relations disputes is talking and i think when we look at the fairfax dispute we ought to remember that rule
9230417 being told you can only come back to work on our terms i just think that that is un australian and unacceptable
9230418 its very confrontational we urge the company to stop having such a jackbooted approach
9230419 forestry tasmania as an independent corporation with state ownership should be up to making its own decisions
9230420 if its got a commercial agreement with with gunns it or any other purchaser of product it needs to be able to negotiate free of political interference

9230453 honor my contract elite xc wants to talk about honoring the contract how about when elite xc honored the contract and my pay to fight edson berto went down after i lost my first fight that was not part of my contract or how about the contract gary shaw breached by not promoting my boxing career gary shaw only gave me one out of four of the agreed upon fights i have not boxed for over a year when i signed with elite xc i was promised they would promote both my boxing and mma careers i could have signed with another mma only company but i wanted to box too
9230454 i am right when i say diaz is not the number one contender elite xc is trying to force this fight for their ratings eddie alaverez is the number one contender and anybody with half a brain knows that a fight with eddie is a way harder fight for me than diaz i will fight diaz but elite has to be fair im not ducking diaz why the hell would i be scared of someone i already beat with that being said i am going to focus on my boxing career i can make more money doing 6 and 8 rounders every other month and make more than i did being the elite xc defending world champ at least i will be able to sleep at night and be able to look myself in the mirror everyday that right there is worth more than 300 bucks a week or fighting a guy i cannot stand for less money than him the second time around will the diaz fight happen yes will the fight happen on elite xc on october 4 2008 probably not the way things are being run by chuck champion a guy whose history is newspapers not fighting and kala someone who talks a lot of game but has never put on a pair of gloves never stepped in a ring or cage kala has had everything handed to him with a silver spoon from daddy does anyone else but me think kala just wants to be famous and stir up all this dirty laundry i guess any publicity is good publicity when i think about it it has been good promotion for their october card since nobody is talking about it until you bring up the noons vs diaz match up

9230470 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less
9230471 we are going to take every penny we can from businesses in america because they are the cause of the problem even though corporate profits are already double taxed first when the company reports the earnings and again when the dividend is distributed to investors the us government can squeeze another round of taxes out of them to redistribute not only to those with a vested interest in the company but to everyone in the nation

9230541 hoy vengo del congreso y este poder se acaba de sumar a esta alianza a m me parece que va quedando claro por lo menos que la educaci n es un prop sito que tiene que ver con todos no s lo con dos y tambi n que la educaci n es una agenda de reconciliaci n nacional
9230542 si seguimos mandando a esos ni os y j venes a la calle sin la preparaci n que necesitan lo nico que hacemos es que la escuela reproduzca pobreza y miseria

9230592 mccain has chosen to balance his ticket with a principled conservative governor palins life story is one of sticking to principle she is living proof that a person can take on the corrupt political establishment including corrupt leaders in her own party and achieve great things
9230593 theres an old expression in politics go along to get along not this time the selection of sarah palin is one big kick in the pants to the corrupt establishment in both parties
9230594 congratulations to john mccain for hearing and responding to conservatives conservatives the base of the party have been listless but now nearly all will work enthusiastically for the mccain palin ticket in fact this is the most enthusiastic conservatives have been since the era for ronald reagan
9230595 this is a grand slam home run conservatives feet havent touched the ground since this announcement
9230596 senator mccain has demonstrated his dedication to life in his selection of sarah palin as his running mate
9230597 governor palin brings another strong pro life voice to the republican ticket in sharp contrast to the pro abortion ticket of barack obama and joe biden
9230598 john mccain is to be commended on his choice of sarah palin a true christian for vice president
9230599 palin an evangelical who is pro life and pro marriage meets all the criterion that cadc set forth for a vp pick unfortunately obama chose joe biden a liberal catholic who is not in compliance with christian moral teaching on abortion or homosexuality
9230600 the excitement was palpable among conservative leaders when they heard that gov palin was sen mccains choice for vice president there is a high level of optimism among conservative leaders that the mccain palin combination is a ticket that will connect with values voters
9230601 the selection of gov palin means that this upcoming election will be historic but beyond making history palin brings substance and excitement she is intelligent young attractive and articulate as a woman and a mother she can attract women voters particularly those who feel disenfranchised
9230602 gov palin can work with both parties and has shown she can clean up government corruption she has not merely talked about the energy crisis she has actively worked to create solutions
9230603 gov palin is pro life and pro marriage she is also a lifelong member of the national rifle association
9230604 personnel is policy with the selection of gov palin sen john mccain has proven that he can exercise sound judgment gov palin has electrified conservatives
9230605 governor palin will change the dynamics of the entire presidential race her admirable record of confronting corruption and living her pro life convictions shows she is a doer not just a talker sarah palin will make history as a vice presidential candidate and not simply because shes a woman but because shes a woman of substance and character
9230606 it is particularly significant that a conservative woman was nominated for the nations second highest office for years the feminist movement has acknowledged for leadership only those women who embrace a radical agenda how refreshing that now we have a woman who reflects the values of mainstream american women sarah palin is pro life pro marriage and pro family she is a woman who is balancing the personal and professional in admirable ways she is an outstanding woman who will be an excellent role model for the nations young people sarah palin is chief among equals with american professional women she brings the kind of balance that characterizes the high achieving women of today she will bring to the forefront of our cultural conversations an intelligent realistic well grounded womans perspective
9230607 take that feminists here is a woman of accomplishment who brings a fresh face to traditional values and models the type of woman most girls want to become

9230632 i still live for the road i dont live for a lady i guess thats part of the problem
9230633 all the things im talkin about in that song the rape the drug abuse and feelin on the outskirts of life as g g would say thats all true
9230634 but just because youre a candidate doesnt mean youre gonna go through with it ive got no respect for anyone who tries to take the easy way out unless you cant take care of yourself or stuff like that im always standin for you to hold onto life as much as you can theres a huge amount of depression out there and thats really what the songs about candidate for suicide is dark but its not sayin do it its just talkin about how it crosses your mind a good bit
9230635 that is a good team and that was a great return against them
9230636 i feel pretty good when i have broken a couple of tackles
9230637 once i get in the open field and turn the corner i feel like ive got a chance
9230638 he made all 29 practices leading up to the game
9230639 he got an iron gator t shirt from coach mick strength and conditioning coach mickey mariotti
9230640 we had a couple of penalties the score was 0 0 and they were driving
9230641 i got the interception and we scored it was kind of a gamebreaker

9230643 when d mo went out i knew i had to step up
9230644 i had to step up and not be the weak link
9230645 that was going to be his last snap at the university of florida if he didnt get it
9230646 it was nice i got a lot of rest on the bench im not used to
9230647 the defense was beating us in points there for a while it was a good thing to see
9230648 i didnt expect to do that in my first game
9230649 my goal was to come out here and play some and have some fun
9230650 we kind of love fast people around here and jeff demps is fast
9230651 he is not a track athlete playing football he is a football player and chris rainey is a fantastic athlete
9230652 i heard the whole crowd in the swamp cheering it was a good feeling it was kind of sweet making those plays it felt like old times at lakeland high
9230653 when you create six turnovers good stuff is going on
9230654 we have guys who love to play if you dont go hard youre in the minority now on defense

9230678 ojd de sprack ganska mycket n r jag skulle stiga upp p en l ktare
9230679 and i thank you senator mccain and mrs mccain for the confidence that you have placed in me senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate i will be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9230680 i know that when senator mccain gave me this opportunity he had a short list of highly qualified men and women and to have made that list at all it was a privilege
9230681 first there are a few people whom i would like you to meet i want to start with my husband todd and todd and i are actually celebrating our 20th anniversary today and i promised him a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver
9230682 and then we have as after my husband who is a lifelong commercial fisherman lifetime alaskan hes a production operator
9230683 along the way todd and i have shared many blessings and four out of five of them are here with us today
9230684 next to todd is our daughter bristol another daughter willow our youngest daughter piper and over in their arms is our son trig a beautiful baby boy he was born just in april his name is trig paxson van palin
9230685 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case today
9230686 i was then appointed ethics commissioner and chairman of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission and when i found corruption there i fought it hard and i held the offenders to account
9230687 when oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase i sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of alaska and we are now were now embarking on a 40 billion natural gas pipeline to help lead america to energy independence
9230688 i signed major ethics reforms and i appointed both democrats and independents to serve in my administration
9230689 well its always though safer in politics to avoid risk to just kind of go along with the status quo
9230690 now no one expects us to agree on everything whether in juneau or in washington but we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and a servants heart
9230691 now no leader in america has shown these qualities so clearly or presents so clear a threat to business as usual in washington as senator john s
9230692 and this is a moment that requires resolve and toughness and strength of heart in the american president
9230693 and im going to make sure nobody does forget that in his campaign there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9230694 this is a moment this is a moment when great causes can be won and great threats overcome depending on the judgment of our next president in a dangerous world it is john mccain who will lead americas friends and allies in preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
9230695 it was john mccain who cautioned long ago about the harm that russian aggression could do to georgia and to other small democratic neighbors and to the world oil markets
9230696 it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know what as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9230697 profiles in courage they can be hard to come by these days you know so often we just find them in books but next week when we nominate john mccain for president were putting one on the ballot
9230698 to serve as vice president beside such a man would be the privilege of a lifetime and its fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9230699 i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9230700 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9230701 senator mccain made a historic and strategic choice in choosing gov sarah palin with the clear intent of reaching out to female hillary supporters theres only one obvious problem shes not hillary clinton
9230702 and so it is unlikely given the right wing bush like positions of mccain and palin that the republican ticket can win over a significant percentage of the more progressive minded hillary supporters
9230703 senator john mccains choice of alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate is a cynical effort to appeal to disappointed hillary clinton voters and get them to vote ultimately against their own self interest
9230704 governor palin may be the second woman vice presidential candidate on a major party ticket but she is not the right woman sadly she is a woman who opposes womens rights just like john mccain
9230705 governor palin is going to be an invaluable addition to the ticket because she understands the importance of respecting and understanding the american taxpayer and fighting wasteful spending
9230706 she is an exceedingly effective leader on the energy issue and understands that mccains focus to bring down energy costs will translate across the economy
9230707 it is fitting that this trust has been given to me almost 88 years to the day after women of america first gained the right to vote
9230708 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9230709 weve reached a point in our civilization where counterculture has mutated into a self obsessed aesthetic vacuum so while hipsterdom is the end product of all prior countercultures its been stripped of its subversion and originality
9230710 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
9230711 these hipster zombies are the idols of the style pages the darlings of viral marketers and the marks of predatory real estate agents
9230712 and they must be buried for cool to be reborn
9230713 yeah i dont know you shouldnt use that word its just
9230714 no its just well if you dont know why then you just shouldnt even use it
9230715 ok so what are you girls doing tonight after this party
9230716 im dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an agenda
9230717 youre not some club kid in new york in the nineties this shit is so hipster
9230718 if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck
9230719 if only we carried rocks instead of cameras wed look like revolutionaries
9230720 when someone expects the worst from me i couldnt care less about letting them down when someone merely loves and supports me and never shows judgment it is so much worse and makes me want to try so much harder
9230721 yaa ayyuhaladziina aamanuu kutiba alaikumus siyaamu kamaa kutiba alalladziina min qablikum la allakum tataquun
9230722 we want to build bridges not walls we want the deaths in the desert to stop
9230723 we dont have any trust in the republican administration but the democratic party is going to have to show us theyre willing to work with us
9230724 i know so many teachers that feel that immigrant families and immigrant students are not being treated fairly
9230725 were here for inclusion and solidarity in that vision martin luther king spoke of
9230726 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
9230727 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
9230728 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
9230729 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
9230730 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
9230731 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
9230732 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
9230733 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
9230734 i promise the buck stops here and i will make a change
9230735 other parties response to the state of the union address

9230737 finally i was forced to admit that i work in a corrupted profession
9230738 i am the mother of the righteous i am the mother of the wicked as well
9230739 i tell you one thing if you want peace of mind do not find fault with others rather see your own faults learn to make the whole world your own no one is a stranger my child the whole world is your own
9230740 god is ones very own the more intensely a person practices spiritual disciplines the more quickly he attains to god
9230741 never fear he is ever looking after you do his work and practice sadhana a little work daily drives away idle thoughts from the mind
9230742 call on the lord who pervades the entire universe he will shower his blessings upon you
9230743 the mind is rendered pure as a result of much austerities god who is purity itself cannot be attained without austerities
9230744 my consciousness has never associated itself with this temporary body before i came on this earth i was the same as a little girl i was the same ever afterward though the dance of creation change around me in the hall of eternity i shall be the same
9230745 i respect the way amma came up from the lowest caste to the top she herself is probably very innocent politically
9230746 but its the people around her i call her a puppet to the hindu fundamentalist groups that want to use her these are some of the most poisonous people in india
9230747 it is apparently one of the socially stabilizing forces on gor it tends to reduce the dislocations disappointments and tragedies inherent in more mobile structures in which men are taught that they are failures if they do not manage to make large amounts of money or excel in one of a small number of prestigious professions the system also helps to keep men of energy and high intelligence in a wide variety of occupations this preventing the drain of such men into a small number of often artificially desiderated occupations this tending then to leave lesser men or frustrated men to practice other hundreds of arts the survival and maintenance of which are important to a superior civilization
9230748 so am i really talking to jar jar here cause you say your name is jedi jake but youre talking like some kind of gungan and they both have two js

9230759 weve won the argument that the water cooling system has adverse affects
9230760 the process that was laid out gives us ample opportunity to make our case about the cooling methods which will make the most sense for indian point
9230761 the decision means that the state is recommending indian point use closed cycle cooling
9230762 privately owned utilities were fighting tooth and nail against installing closed cycle cooling
9230763 these utilities have huge resources and hire hordes of lawyers engineers and biologists the best money can buy if closed cycle cooling costs them tens of millions of dollars to install they are very happy to spend just 1 million a year on lawyers to avoid that to date they have been very successful
9230764 weve done a study of cost estimates and the system that would be most appropriate for indian point will cost about 1 5 billion
9230765 the towers wouldnt be quite as big as three mile island but they would be about 100 feet wide and 150 feet tall that would triple the footprint of indian point
9230766 they talk about the costliest and most obtrusive technology available
9230767 they say that its economically unfeasible when they really have no intention of using such a system its a bait and switch tactic geared towards scaring the public
9230768 engineers from indian point will have to make a business decision on that
9230769 in the last 15 years entergy and con ed have spent over 40 million upgrading the cooling system for units 1 and 2
9230770 so does it really make sense to replace the cooling system that has just a marginal impact thats the question that needs to be resolved
9230771 to achieve your best get in over your head and rise to the top
9230772 we must stress that the foster family still remains unaccounted for
9230773 i dont know how much it was exactly but i know it was a lot it might well have helped them with their financial difficulties
9230774 he would go into the woods and kill anything that moved from rabbits to squirrels
9230775 i know his mother who was living in the annex and hoped to make a home there was very upset
9230776 i was with jill watching as chris moved a tractor when a willow tree came crashing down narrowly missing him
9230777 he made a joke about having to up his life insurance its hard to believe he was joking about dying a fortnight ago and now we dont know whats happened to him
9230778 he was a very nice friendly happy go lucky chap
9230779 chris told me he made his first million when he was 27 and had lost it when he was 28
9230780 this is very painful for me bryan always called me dad he was out of town with us when this happened hes a good kid
9230781 you dont actually get to know whos cooking for the queen but id never employ him because the food was s
9230782 it was ok though my sister had my mums credit card so we put it on that
9230783 when i get chased down the street in belgium its a relief to know im going home to my little bubble where everyone knows who i am but are just happy to leave me alone
9230784 its insane we assumed the album would be another slow burner over in america but it seems to be picking up much faster than we ever expected
9230785 some products considered luxury such as alcohol and tobacco have heavy duties on them if disposable products were categorised in a similar way then they could be subjected to similar duties
9230786 every respected independent estimate has concluded that landfill tax already more than accounts for the problems created by sending waste to landfill
9230787 new tax rises on disposable products arent necessary and the only reason the government would think about them would be to cynically grab more of taxpayers hard earned money politicians must stop using environmental concerns as a smokescreen for raising taxes
9230788 after a fantastic summer of success the snp approach the new political year full of vim and in fine fettle for the fife by election with a solid 11 point lead over labour for a westminster election
9230789 the latest revelation of the debt is mind blowing and it reveals the apparent oversight by the aviation authorities in both sides of the atlantic into airlines financial affairs
9230790 we have to ask quite how that debt was allowed to happen we are into nine figure sums here it is very serious money we arent talking third world currencies here but canadian dollars that is more than 60million in pounds and it would appear this has been an ongoing issue and seemingly did not happen overnight
9230791 perhaps it is time for the aviation authorities in canada and in the uk to take a careful look at the current procedures to make sure that when airlines do go bust thousands of passengers do not suffer
9230792 canada is a cheaper country than britain in terms of workforce and costs and if they owe that kind of sums over there what kind of figures will come out in the uk
9230793 it is a complete misrepresentation of what the true picture is
9230794 zooms debts will be between 20 and 25million in total the civil aviation authority would never let an airline take off with that kind of debt
9230795 all my colleagues the prime minister every single one of us are focused on one single thing that is helping people helping the economy go through what is a very difficult time
9230796 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9230797 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression
9230798 this weekend on the eve of the launch of gordon browns heavily trailed recovery plan the governments economic position is falling apart almost hour by hour
9230799 either gordon brown must back up what alistair darling has said or it will be clear to everyone that the chancellor no longer commands the confidence of the prime minister
9230800 lord beaverbrook was an incredible person and the family are very proud of him everyone talks about him because he was great and good and helped win the war
9230801 what hodge did was not great not great at all
9230802 ive learned that my family were food hoarding suicidal murderers so i was a little concerned where this journey would take us
9230803 if you had told me i would be standing in a small town in new england in america and we were one of the first families to settle here its quite mind blowing

9230933 anyone who would like to interpret this differ ently is absolutely confused
9230934 if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought it was offensive
9230935 the distorted minds that seek controversy should rather worry about racist prec edents in their own countries in fact our respective histories are precisely why we must speak up against those who would perpetuate negative racial stereotyping in the context of the beijing olympics dedicated to harmony and world unity this ad is a disharmonious gesture and an insult to the chinese hosts as well as to asians around the world
9230936 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
9230937 tensions between russia and the west were ratcheted even higher today after moscow warned that the american naval build up in the black sea could be seen as a declaration of war
9230938 normally battleships do not deliver aid and this is battleship diplomacy this does not make the situation more stable
9230939 despite the apparent strength of the nato naval group in the black sea a single salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or thee missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group within twenty minutes the waters would be clear

9230945 i cant believe that mccain would pick a running mate that has such little experience
9230946 it completely takes the argument that obama is not prepared to be president off the table
9230947 she palin is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9230948 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman

9230968 stupid piece of jewellery that would break in five minutes
9230969 what are you doing on that bl dy computer anyway
9230970 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9230971 the latest disavowal of his staffs comments on his behalf or in his name continues a tactic obama employed repeatedly during his contentious battle with d punjab
9230972 our supporters our staff get overzealous they start saying things that i would not say
9230973 difficult to navigate folders and move files around the way i want to
9230974 insufficient panels amp customization in ubuntu i can have as many panels i want can put all kinds of stuff on them and can arrange them however i want in osx you just have the dock and you can really only put applications or files on them and you cant even put in a separator to keep them organized
9230975 program menus are glued to the top of the screen on one monitor only which detaches them from the window this is especailly annoying when the program youre using is on the second monitor
9230976 the date time doesnt open to a navigable calendar i often use this to check dates in the past or future
9230977 you cant see hidden files unless you run a command from the terminal to turn them on thus hidden files are either always on or always off
9230978 twelve years ago i would have been hard pressed to understand why id want to be involved sexually with one person this long

9230980 but the real rewards of a relationship come after youve been together a while thats where t a and i are lucky
9230981 if youre single and in the public eye and you have a few dates youre a sex addict
9230982 david was accused of being a sex addict which i always found very exciting and then i found out it wasnt true
9230983 theres nothing wrong with acknowledging the panoply of lifes rich experience
9230984 you cant control your mind why would you want to you cant feel guilty about being alive about being a man about feeling attracted you can only control your actions
9230985 i mean if we start to talk about that i start to give away the third act
9230986 yes lets just say yes its definitely got franchise written all over it
9230987 you know again id love to tell you but i cant divulge that its a little bit under wraps right now
9230988 thats the most romantic thing anyones ever done for me
9230989 what makes this movie different from catch me if you can or any other con man movie is that its a love story
9230990 some of the more shocking elements of the movie the idea of these men trying to snatch love and bliss in the middle of the most awful environment imaginable are actually very funny
9230991 russell was so misguidedly relentless about love that youve got to admire it
9230992 i always try to figure out what delusion the character is living under we all kind of have them whether its a feeling of worthlessness or whatever it is
9230993 when your mother gives you up for adoption and then doesnt want you back when you find her that definitely leaves a hole in you
9230994 and im giving steven a blow job i look up and theres this big huge black storm cloud coming toward us this is true steven turns the boat straight toward the storm because he knows that you cant outrun a storm you have to go through the middle
9230995 but phillip doesnt know this and its maybe his queeniest moment when he has this tiff and screams what the fuck are you doing
9230996 but when he gets out as far as im concerned well probably be together

9231025 if she had been around for two terms as governor or been a senator it would have been an incredible choice
9231026 who else could he have found who appealed to the conservative base and as someone who was a reformer
9231027 the authors quote four scholars attacking gov palins fitness for the office of vice president among them david kennedy is a maxed out obama donor joel goldstein is also an obama donor and doris kearns goodwin has donated exclusively to democrats this cycle finally matthew dallek is a former speech writer for dick gephardt this is not a story about scholars questioning governor palins credentials so much as partisan democrats who would find a reason to disqualify or discount any nominee put forward by senator mccain

9231038 i just want you to know that your husband is seeing my wife
9231039 if you love her and you want to make this work then you need to go home and be with her
9231040 she said that she yelled something like terry wait and this was at about the same time as she pushed on the door to try to get into the bathroom and at the same time she heard a shot
9231041 i fell in love with cheryl the first time we met
9231042 i let someone come between you i which should have never happened
9231043 i look back on everything see where i gave up love companion ship for attention affection it would be wonderful if i could turn back our lives for the past four years
9231044 if you live gods will and give with a happy heart you will reap the rewards
9231045 do you remember where you were 13 years ago on this day
9231046 he just wasnt the happy go lucky guy id known all my life
9231047 to keep cheryl in the style she wants to live
9231048 i always thought my uncle was in pretty good financial standing
9231049 it was just a shock to me that his finances were in that bad condition
9231050 one day she hates you and one day she loves you and the next day she hates you
9231051 you have given me and my family more you have given your people and this country more than you will ever know
9231052 if this work was hard or overwhelming if she ever felt any loneliness in so often being the first you never wouldve known it
9231053 because stephanie was not a complainer she always had that big smile even when times were tough self pity was never an option as far as stephanie was concerned
9231054 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides and she we would see each other and she just said to me this is what it means to be a friend for me
9231055 what struck me most about stephanie was how even after a decade in congress she was so utterly unaffected by the ways of washington
9231056 she was still a home girl stephanie couldnt put on airs if she tried
9231057 as this nations financial crisis deepens some have argued that the fed has not done enough perhaps the question should be has the fed done too much have its earlier actions created the crisis we now face the current crisis is the result of a flood of easy money from 2002 to 2006 the party came to an end when the fed started raising interest rates to more normal levels and investors started pricing risk more stringently americas current fiscal and monetary policies bear a striking resemblance to those of the late 1960s and 1970s which resulted in more than a decade of stagnant economic growth a declining dollar and inflation first america should abandon central planning and allow the market not the fed to set short term rates it makes no more sense for the fed to set the price of money the most ubiquitous of all commodities than it does for it to set the price of wheat corn or any other commodity as with long term rates short term rates should be market driven during times of crisis the fed could continue to provide liquidity to the banking system through its treasury auction facilities
9231058 in the dozen or so years until 2007 it had become as close to a global economic orthodoxy in economic policy making as we ever see central banks should target a low and stable rate of inflation this replaced earlier orthodoxies such as that central banks should maintain a fixed exchange rate with an ounce of gold the u s fed the eurpoean central bank the bank of england and other rich country central banks have generally made 2 inflation give or take a smidge the touchstone of good performance fed officials have for 20 years paid public obeisance to the statutory dual mandate to maximize employment as well as stabilize prices yet one of the great attractions of inflation targeting was that it only appeared to constrain central bankers discretion the irony of the collapse of inflation targetings intellectual edifice is that it has long been championed by fed chairman ben bernanke a sudden exogenous shock cuts demand to 98 widgets but the central bank can then print money to induce consumers to buy up the two excess widgets thereby stopping the factory from cutting production capacity and causing a recession it claws back the excess money when equilibrium is restored but what if this analogy is deeply flawed what if the economy is much more like two factories than one one factory produces say real estate widgets and the other produces everything else if consumers decide they want fewer real estate widgets and more of some other widgets it will take time and resources for capacity to shift from the first factory to the second gdp growth will decline during that time by printing more money the central bank only makes it longer and more painful not least by producing significant and prolonged inflation
9231059 prior to the acre show i didnt even have a colored business card well now i have a beautiful business card several postcards and i designed and printed a full colored brochure and price sheet i even learned how to send my brochure and pricing information via the internet

9231078 my goals for this blog are to voice not only my opinions but the opinions of so many islander fans that never get the chance to get their opinions heard because of the lack of forums available to us in the media the islanders organization continue to provide the fans the opportunity to speak out and be vocal and no matter what our opinions are seem to really listen and care what we think

9231083 sessions in which people from williams sonoma latter day saint church and national institute of health asked me questions about very specific problems they had

9231118 ghost town is absolutely the best script ive read for a movie i must have turned down over a hundred movies over the years because they have to tick a lot of boxes for me to be interested

9231126 in the past bordeaux had felt that it didnt need wine tourism but thats changing
9231127 we get a lot of english speaking visitors for our tastings and winery tours because theres no language barrier
9231128 when i first moved here 13 years ago bordeaux was sooty dirty and smelly
9231129 now that the towns been cleaned up the tourists have started to come

9231162 i dont think hes dead hes got places he can go to places scattered around europe these are properties no one knows about he can go and just disappear
9231163 just flipped because the pressure of it was too much for him
9231164 this is an extremely tragic situation the gentleman who had just turned 48 yesterday unfortunately has been beaten severely and now his lifes in jeopardy with a severe brain trauma and at this point theyre not sure if hes going to be able to pull through or not
9231165 he went to italy with the knowledge of the f o in order to develop his contacts he greatly exceeded his instructions
9231166 he is a man with somewhat unusual views about the terms on which peace should be made with hitler
9231167 he thinks the world should be divided up into german and british spheres of influence the germans being given a more or less free hand in europe
9231168 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office

9231175 well see if they can stop it most of them cant
9231176 i have the utmost respect for him and his staff
9231177 i just dont think they were ready for our speed
9231178 he went to italy with the knowledge of the f o in order to develop his contacts he greatly exceeded his instructions
9231179 he is a man with somewhat unusual views about the terms on which peace should be made with hitler

9231184 we have got a specially adapted treadmill that is linked in to a virtual reality system so a little bit like a computer game
9231185 the particularly interesting aspect in terms of the research we are doing here is that we have found that it we manipulate the virtual reality so that people think they are moving slower than they are what happens is that they move faster and better
9231186 they do not realise they are putting any more effort in and they are not feeling any more pain in fact they are less anxious than normal
9231187 they have a better quality of walking so it has huge implications for recovery
9231188 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realising it
9231189 when like andy people walk with a stick they automatically lean to one side
9231190 this treadmill keeps them upright and enables them to adjust their balance better
9231191 because it is a virtual reality andy can see things on the screen as he is walking along so he is not conscious how slow or fast he is going as his mind is occupied
9231192 on a normal treadmill you have nowhere to look but your feet and that is where people lose their balance
9231193 if he can get to use it on a regular basis he will make great strides
9231194 if this was available maybe three or four years ago he might not be walking with a stick now
9231195 it is just such a fantastic system for helping with rehabilitation
9231196 jen webers and david adams looked like they were in control today it was great to see some of these kids get out and put the uniform on for the first time

9231198 you want a broader story with more than one character an ensemble of characters
9231199 it was cool to be able to write about more than master chief
9231200 theres lots to learn in the canon and you have to learn to respect it
9231201 i made up a press guide for the planet as if they were trying to sell themselves and i sent it off to halo writer joseph staten
9231202 there are lots of spartans and the covenant arent in a civil war theyre just evil
9231203 the covenant were pretty much finished off but in the first person shooter the master chief was the one all powerful army so we had to build more into the humans to make them a balanced army
9231204 i think there are people who want to play halo from a different angel
9231205 they are excited to see that universe expanding a bit
9231206 we look at all of the control systems for console rts games the one we learned the most from was pikmin that was a very good strategy game
9231207 vai da base parlamentar governista oposi o espiona ministros assessores do presidente da rep blica o presidente do senado e chega ao extremo de se envolver na sucess o presid ncia daquela casa legislativa

9231213 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9231214 it is uncertain whether congress will take the administration up on its request
9231215 some republicans have already embraced the idea with representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the judiciary committee introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal
9231216 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden

9231267 he thinks the world should be divided up into german and british spheres of influence the germans being given a more or less free hand in europe
9231268 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office

9231281 but lets face it im not going to be able to fit it all on three pages
9231282 we started this whole thing out as a joke essentially a school project that wasnt supposed to be good
9231283 i didnt mean for people to like it so much
9231284 its hard sometimes but i still love it i love everybody in it and we really have a good time and enjoy ourselves when we are filming
9231285 i love monsters and everything about it and i am so glad that im apart of it
9231286 the second movie was interesting but nobody knew who these new characters were they were just mashed together
9231287 who are these people why were they found together i wanted to learn more about them
9231288 we actually have an actual script last time was like improv
9231289 i have a lot more character hes a little deeper now i can tap into what hes trying to do
9231290 im just playing him very superficial and not really cutting under the surface very much but theres not much below the surface
9231291 i feel that the new characters get very down played but thats how it should be
9231292 ive been tempted to quit making it a few times it was like whatever no ones going to care
9231293 im making it for the people who liked the first one i believe this is a good story and as clich as it may be but i still think its a decent story and it needs to be told and people want to know what happens with these characters
9231294 and since then a lot of other people have found out about it weve got someone in freakin
9231295 ive always told eric and anyone else what makes a good film is a lot of heart
9231296 i have a problem with mr jones he is very mean when i see him angry i often get scared my hands get shaky he always gives lines if you tell him something he tells you no with a very loud voice
9231297 in the library mr jones makes us go to the back of the line for nothing if somebody talks not us he still tells us go to the back of the line
9231298 i hate mr jones because he gives me lines and i did not do anything
9231299 mr smith is very very very very strict in soccer we are tying our shoelaces in the changing room and he told us out in two minutes when two minutes passed he says out for soccer he said if youre not playing your team is disqualified for the whole year he isnt fair because he likes team b more than any other team if something is wrong and we tell him he shouts at us sometimes he gives us 10 000 lines he exaggerates a lot we dont like that if team b does something he likes he gives them 100 extra points thats why theyre always winning he does that every time this is my very big problem
9231300 every time mr black chooses mehdi to be the monitor in video its not fair one time i asked him can i be monitor then he said mehdi can be monitor also in sports he always asks jim to demonstrate everything he never chooses anyone else

9231326 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9231327 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists
9231328 and today today as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has 79 billion in surplus while we are wallowing in deficit john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9231329 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
9231330 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit cards bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush

9231369 es un desvar o que surge de la irresponsabilidad y la falta de respeto
9231370 se plantean para la educaci n b sica las horas m s negras que yo recuerde
9231371 a todos aquellos que nos importa la educaci n p blica debemos estar dispuestos a salir en su defensa de las normales porque son un patrimonio de la educaci n mexicana e igualmente estar decididos a participar en su consolidaci n y a limpiarlas de los vicios que se han fortalecido en ese sistema pero que no quede duda estamos convencidos de su vigencia no por nostalgia sino por realismo y por sentido nacional la palabra la tienen ahora las escuelas
9231372 corregir desviaciones reforzarlas acad micamente combatir el burocratismo y el favoritismo que han sido estimulados por el propio snte y por los gobiernos estatales es lo que deber a plantearse en este momento pero insisto simplemente no hay alternativa no se encuentra por ejemplo en las universidades y menos en las privadas que tanto han aprovechado la simpat a de la direcci n del snte para ganar dinero
9231373 juzgar a las escuelas y la calidad de sus egresados desde este engendro es injusto y ofensivo para ambos es enormemente irresponsable frente a cualquier intento por elevar la calidad de la educaci n
9231374 hay much sima gente en las normales demandando este tipo de servicios que siente la necesidad de formarse mejor e incluso a veces paga de su bolsillo por cosas que no valen la pena en la b squeda de consolidar su competencia profesional hay que evaluar con seriedad pero no tengo duda de que los resultados indicar n que existen buenas normales aquellas manejadas con seriedad con honradez y a las cuales se les pueden corregir sus errores con muchas m s ventajas de las que se presentar an con cualquier otra alternativa
9231375 por eso digo con pena que en particular en estos primeros a os del gobierno de calder n se est n planteando para la educaci n b sica las horas m s negras que yo recuerde por donde le veas

9231420 el reto es muy desafiante pero es muy esperanzador saber que el m rito y el esfuerzo van a regresar a las aulas mexicanas

9231429 ser la primera vez donde m s de un mill n de maestros del sindicato podr n tener un acceso a un conocimiento y una formaci n diferente
9231430 el propio sindicato est preocupado por reivindicar la figura del profesor por devolverle dignidad y orgullo hay una presi n ciudadana hist rica y poderosa para que la agenda educativa vaya a temas de calidad
9231431 ha sido y no tengo ning n dejo en reconocerlo la negociaci n m s desafiante m s dif cil que he podido construir en mi vida tambi n debo decir que he contado con disposici n y voluntad de la contraparte por eso es tan importante socializar la alianza
9231432 hoy vengo del congreso y este poder se acaba de sumar a esta alianza a m me parece que va quedando claro por lo menos que la educaci n es un prop sito que tiene que ver con todos no s lo con dos y tambi n que la educaci n es una agenda de reconciliaci n nacional
9231433 si seguimos mandando a esos ni os y j venes a la calle sin la preparaci n que necesitan lo nico que hacemos es que la escuela reproduzca pobreza y miseria
9231434 planteamos tambi n una reforma de contenidos los alumnos van a la escuela muy poquitas horas ya s que los ni os no van a estar de acuerdo conmigo pero en general debemos de tener una l gica diferente nos urge la participaci n m s clara de los pap s nos urge mirar a la escuela
9231435 la convocatoria s lo incluye la programaci n detallada que emerge del presupuesto de egresos de la federaci n 2008 toda la vacancia de los estados la que es parte de la plantilla ordinaria y que queda libre o puede quedar libre de manera temporal hasta donde he visto nadie la ha puesto
9231436 se da un pacto unilateral y obviamente estamos frente a un problema de verdad que es el hecho de que la implementaci n de la alianza s nos necesita a los estados pero si vamos a ser empleado o simples pagadores de sus proyectos y programas indudablemente esto va a tener poco xito
9231437 si mi estimaci n es correcta la mitad de las plazas no se estar an renovando por la v a del concurso
9231438 si la tasa de renovaci n del sistema educativo es del 4 por ciento de los 970 mil maestros de escuelas p blicas significa como 40 mil plazas entre vacantes por diferentes motivos y de nueva creaci n
9231439 quiere decir que los sistemas estatales no est n poniendo sus plazas por eso ser a muy conveniente que la alianza diera a conocer cu ntas plazas vacantes se dan al a o por entidad porque las 25 mil plazas anunciadas representa tan s lo 2 por ciento del total
9231440 hay una decisi n fundamental que tomamos el s bado con el sindicato se acord que a partir del examen todas las plazas que se van a proponer en la secretar a todas ser n bajo el examen de oposici n
9231441 los que no puedan ser contratados en este periodo normalmente los maestros su prejubilatorio lo presentan en octubre pero ya tendremos presentado el examen por los alumnos y yo espero un promedio de 300 jubilaciones en octubre y ah podremos colocar a varios de los aspirantes que no encontraran espacio este d a
9231442 nosotros estamos obedeciendo totalmente la convocatoria y esperamos que se va a respetar por eso es porque se estableci este comit
9231443 conocer los trabajos y la forma en que se realiza un proceso como ste esperamos transparencia e igualdad a la hora de evaluar
9231444 aqu en la entidad todo se est haciendo con transparencia y de acuerdo a los lineamientos de la sep
9231445 uno es para los maestros que no tienen ninguna plaza y la otra es para los maestros que son interinos aunque finalmente tendr amos que sujetarnos a los propios acuerdos que la comisi n nacional acordara
9231446 estamos observando el proceso y la transparencia de este mecanismo de trabajo
9231447 tenemos que detectar todos los casos para ver cu les son casos que s se justifican legalmente para que no les quiten su trabajo hay otros que no se justifican cada caso es diferente y se tienen que ver de manera individual
9231448 tenemos que hablar con cada uno de ellos para ver cu l es el caso y cuando haya justificaci n entrar a la defensa del profesor
9231449 esto va en dem rito del servicio educativo pero la revisi n la har n los responsables del rea de conflicto de las secciones con la secretar a de educaci n nombre por nombre
9231450 ellos quedan un poco maniatados porque no tienen la formaci n de docentes la convocatoria limit a muchos por el candado que present la propia instituci n pero en esos casos como ya es algo que el trabajador ya ten a tenemos que negociarlo con secretar a
9231451 es un desvar o que surge de la irresponsabilidad y la falta de respeto
9231452 se plantean para la educaci n b sica las horas m s negras que yo recuerde
9231453 a todos aquellos que nos importa la educaci n p blica debemos estar dispuestos a salir en su defensa de las normales porque son un patrimonio de la educaci n mexicana e igualmente estar decididos a participar en su consolidaci n y a limpiarlas de los vicios que se han fortalecido en ese sistema pero que no quede duda estamos convencidos de su vigencia no por nostalgia sino por realismo y por sentido nacional la palabra la tienen ahora las escuelas
9231454 corregir desviaciones reforzarlas acad micamente combatir el burocratismo y el favoritismo que han sido estimulados por el propio snte y por los gobiernos estatales es lo que deber a plantearse en este momento pero insisto simplemente no hay alternativa no se encuentra por ejemplo en las universidades y menos en las privadas que tanto han aprovechado la simpat a de la direcci n del snte para ganar dinero
9231455 juzgar a las escuelas y la calidad de sus egresados desde este engendro es injusto y ofensivo para ambos es enormemente irresponsable frente a cualquier intento por elevar la calidad de la educaci n
9231456 hay much sima gente en las normales demandando este tipo de servicios que siente la necesidad de formarse mejor e incluso a veces paga de su bolsillo por cosas que no valen la pena en la b squeda de consolidar su competencia profesional hay que evaluar con seriedad pero no tengo duda de que los resultados indicar n que existen buenas normales aquellas manejadas con seriedad con honradez y a las cuales se les pueden corregir sus errores con muchas m s ventajas de las que se presentar an con cualquier otra alternativa
9231457 por eso digo con pena que en particular en estos primeros a os del gobierno de calder n se est n planteando para la educaci n b sica las horas m s negras que yo recuerde por donde le veas

9231465 on average about 10 only of the birds dropped on the continent return to their lofts in this country it must be assumed that a great number fall into german hands
9231466 during the past few weeks i also understand there has been a great concentration on the brest and brittany areas
9231467 it might therefore be possible to deduce that we have considerable interest in this region
9231468 the pigeon is sent in a cardboard container which can quickly be buried or burnt with a little bag of corn and a questionnaire
9231469 these birds are dropped over a chosen area in the hope at least some of them will fall into the hands of supporters of the allied cause
9231470 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question asked
9231471 because pigeons are used to pass on messages its understandable someone thought of this
9231472 it must have seemed like a really good idea at the time but possibly not the next day

9231478 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides we would see each other and she would say to me this is what it means to be a friend and all i could say is i understand and that is a testimony to her and the kind of person she was

9231497 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working

9231499 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9231500 hes paid his dues i think hes really ready to move forward
9231501 he has the experience and hes had the opportunity to play matches against all kinds of players so i think its now his chance to do it
9231502 won the first set i remember so that was cool
9231503 like the main thing from that match i remember i was playing at 2 p m and i knew espn went on the air at 3 i wanted to make it to 3 to get some espn time which i did hopefully ive gotten a lot better since then he has too

9231510 we have got a specially adapted treadmill that is linked in to a virtual reality system so a little bit like a computer game
9231511 the particularly interesting aspect in terms of the research we are doing here is that we have found that it we manipulate the virtual reality so that people think they are moving slower than they are what happens is that they move faster and better
9231512 they do not realise they are putting any more effort in and they are not feeling any more pain in fact they are less anxious than normal
9231513 they have a better quality of walking so it has huge implications for recovery
9231514 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realising it
9231515 when like andy people walk with a stick they automatically lean to one side
9231516 this treadmill keeps them upright and enables them to adjust their balance better
9231517 because it is a virtual reality andy can see things on the screen as he is walking along so he is not conscious how slow or fast he is going as his mind is occupied
9231518 on a normal treadmill you have nowhere to look but your feet and that is where people lose their balance
9231519 if he can get to use it on a regular basis he will make great strides
9231520 if this was available maybe three or four years ago he might not be walking with a stick now
9231521 it is just such a fantastic system for helping with rehabilitation

9231526 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9231527 by reaping the benefits of a stable global order based on agreements that make trade and investment both possible and profitable
9231528 so when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9231529 if you want to be welcome at the top table or organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9231530 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules it adheres to
9231531 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9231532 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependence on less stable or reliable partners
9231533 more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9231534 this case is currently ongoing and i cannot comment any further about the case due to that fact

9231544 when a father or paternal grandfather kills a child ghesas a religious term for punishment cannot be conducted and the perpetrator is only liable for financial restitution
9231545 when a man observes his wife during an act of consensual sex with another man he the husband can rightfully kill them both and in case the wife was a non consenting actor then the husband can rightfully kill the man the same is applicable to physical harms
9231546 i know of a man who knocked his wife unconscious set her on fire and put a pillow over her mouth to asphyxiate and silence her of course the women died but before her death she told the nurse what had happened considering such a horrible act the man in this case ended up paying just 40 000 000 rial 4 300 usd as restitution

9231554 so many people have drawn together to put on a fantastic festival

9231556 ensure we have up to date figures that will help us better target the help we provide for veterans in prison
9231557 effectively when armed personnel return there is no help for them
9231558 contrasts greatly with the way the united states provide counselling and assistance to their armed personnel
9231559 i have come to the conclusion that if proper treatment was available for these disturbed servicemen hundreds if not thousands would not have offended
9231560 the government is letting them and their families down very badly indeed
9231561 as many as 8 500 former soldiers are currently in custody in the uk
9231562 there is no systematic availability of stress related counselling this should be made available without delay and would drastically reduce the number of receptions into custody
9231563 the mod works closely with the service charities to support veterans when they leave the armed forces and for those who find themselves in prison
9231564 the prison in reach initiative already provides advice on the support available to veterans before and after their release robust systems are in place to treat and prevent ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and other stress disorders
9231565 im absolutely elated and very emotional and just grateful to everyone whos voted for us

9231574 beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves you will recognize them by their fruits are grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles so every healthy tree bears good fruit but the diseased tree bears bad fruit

9231595 knowing the first that in the last days there shall come deceitful scoffers walking after their own lusts
9231596 woe to them that make wicked laws and when they write write injustice

9231599 behold this was the inequity of sodom thy sister pride fullness of bread and abundance and the idleness of her and of her daughters and they did not put forth their hand to the needy and to the poor and they were lifted up and committed abominations before me and i took them away as thou hast seen
9231600 for there is no respect of persons with god for whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without the law and whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the gentiles who have not the law do by nature those things that are of the law these having not the law are a law to themselves who shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness to them and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another
9231601 whosoever have sinned without the law shall perish without the law
9231602 whosoever have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law
9231603 for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified
9231604 the gentiles who have not the law do by nature those things that are of the law these having not the law are a law to themselves
9231605 who shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness to them and their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another
9231606 those who do not accept homosexuality are bigots and intolerant to the diversity of others
9231607 for i have foretold unto him that i will judge this house for ever for iniquity because he knew that his sons did wickedly and did not chastise them
9231608 the children will complain of an ungodly father because for his sake they are in reproach
9231609 remember homosexuality and abortion are sins and those who support them are guilty of the same sins
9231610 behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy and they were haughty and committed abomination before me therefore i took them away as i saw good
9231611 whereas the men of sodom received not the strangers when they came among them
9231612 he did not spare the people among whom lot was living whom he detested for their pride
9231613 it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city

9231615 its stunning that someone with so little national and international experience might be heartbeat away from the presidency gov palin is a classic alaska story she is an example of the opportunity our state offers to those with talent initiative and determination mccain picked palin despite a recent blemish on her ethically pure resume while she was governor members of her family and staff tried to get her ex brother in law fired from the alaska state troopers her public safety commissioner would not do so she forced him out supposedly for other reasons while she runs for vice president the legislature has an investigator on the case for all those advantages palin joins the ticket with one huge weakness shes a total beginner on national and international issues gov palin will have to spend the next two months convincing americans that shes ready to be a heartbeat away from the presidency

9231667 this study adds to existing evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis which states that early exposure to potential allergens results in a reduced risk of asthma development
9231668 although there is a small minority of parents who object to the vaccine because of their beliefs about sexuality and the fact that it prevents a sexually transmitted infection to most parents the mode of transmission is not whats important
9231669 the families who are struggling with what to do about this vaccine are focused on issues like safety
9231670 they want us to have more experience with it and have it used by more people
9231671 we tend to overrate the power of conservative forces in our society on the everyday lives of people for example roman catholics use contraception and have abortions at about the same rates as other women in this country
9231672 we have got a specially adapted treadmill that is linked in to a virtual reality system so a little bit like a computer game
9231673 the particularly interesting aspect in terms of the research we are doing here is that we have found that it we manipulate the virtual reality so that people think they are moving slower than they are what happens is that they move faster and better
9231674 they do not realise they are putting any more effort in and they are not feeling any more pain in fact they are less anxious than normal
9231675 they have a better quality of walking so it has huge implications for recovery
9231676 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realising it
9231677 when like andy people walk with a stick they automatically lean to one side
9231678 this treadmill keeps them upright and enables them to adjust their balance better
9231679 because it is a virtual reality andy can see things on the screen as he is walking along so he is not conscious how slow or fast he is going as his mind is occupied
9231680 on a normal treadmill you have nowhere to look but your feet and that is where people lose their balance
9231681 if he can get to use it on a regular basis he will make great strides
9231682 if this was available maybe three or four years ago he might not be walking with a stick now
9231683 it is just such a fantastic system for helping with rehabilitation
9231684 to really improve adolescent health programs should seek to reduce risk taking improve social capital and improve levels of affluence
9231685 overall assessments of health may be an important measure for different reasons than more specific and detailed measurements it is a holistic approach as opposed to a specific approach
9231686 our analysis actually states that social capital affluence and risk taking all influence health but these things do not work together
9231687 i was looking for information on the holocaust and i found a lot of neat sites with historical facts about germany
9231688 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on the front nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9231689 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9231690 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9231691 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9231692 although i had 59 in my mind once i made that putt it certainly didnt affect my golf

9231696 professor chomsky is right to borrow from president clinton the world is much more impressed by the power of americas example than the example of american power a true friend to american would not stand by while president bush squanders americas birthright
9231697 the uk governments reaction to the us program of rendition a policy of kidnapping people and taking them to places where they may be tortured has been inadequate to say the least it is scarcely credible that now despite all we know about rendition and the uks involvement in it the british government still refuses to condemn this illegal immoral and counterproductive policy
9231698 the region was taken by a treaty that cuba was forced to sign under military occupation

9231700 an automated e mail system that allows law enforcement agencies to retrieve subscriber and billing details by consulting the system directly all they need is a mobile phone number this process requires no human intervention from t mobile staff the system automatically generates spreadsheets showing the subscriber and billing information and sends them to the law enforcement e mail address
9231701 we consider that these measures are a proportionate interference with individuals right to privacy to ensure protection of the public
9231702 i am concerned that so many authorities who applied for powers to be given to them apparently do not use them and i do not know why this is if this state of affairs continues unexplained then consideration must be given to removing the powers from them
9231703 during the period covered by this report only 154 local authorities made use of their powers to acquire communications data a total of 1 707 requests were made for communications data and the vast majority were for basic subscriber information very few local authorities have used their powers to acquire itemized call records in relation to the investigations which they have conducted indeed our inspections have shown that generally the local authorities could make much more use of communications data as a powerful tool to investigate crime
9231704 the commissioners reports offer valuable oversight and provide reassurance that these powers are being used appropriately
9231705 we need to ensure ripa powers are used appropriately and are not undermined
9231706 invest in properly trained intelligence officers who could operate covertly
9231707 the government is reviewing those public authorities that have access to these powers to ensure that they have a continuing and justifiable requirement for them on completion the government will list the authorities that can use each of the powers and the purposes for which they can use them and set out revised codes of practice
9231708 councils have been criticised for using the powers in relation to issues that can be portrayed as trivial or not considered a crime by the public yet councils are caught between the rock of public opinion and the hard place of being told they should actually be using some of these powers more widely
9231709 it is important that they use these powers carefully and appropriately and we will be working with the surveillance commissioner to help enable this
9231710 the lga has recently suggested that we look at footfall in supermarkets they reckon tesco has pretty good accurate information about the people who use their stores i welcome that kind of imaginative thinking if it can help us to get a better and more accurate view at the local level of what the impact of migration is
9231711 the ceding of intrusive powers to local government and other bodies and giving them access to once sacrosanct personal data
9231712 yet again the government has proved itself unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
9231713 revise draft privacy directives that call for mandatory destruction to permit the retention of critical data for a reasonable period
9231714 he would make sure it would no longer have a say on any justice and home affairs matters
9231715 the european parliament faces a crucial decision is this the type of society we would like to live in a society where all our actions are recorded all of our interactions may be mapped treating the use of communications infrastructures as criminal activity
9231716 any type of data for any type of security purpose for any period at all
9231717 everything is getting worse there are more kidnappings and more murders
9231718 i was kind of surprised because i wasnt expecting it but i thought it was cool for newtons father to do that

9231720 because its a strategy game you play as more than one person

9231724 i made up a press guide for the planet as if they were trying to sell themselves and i sent it off to halo writer joseph staten
9231725 there are lots of spartans and the covenant arent in a civil war theyre just evil
9231726 the covenant were pretty much finished off but in the first person shooter the master chief was the one all powerful army so we had to build more into the humans to make them a balanced army
9231727 i think there are people who want to play halo from a different angel
9231728 they are excited to see that universe expanding a bit
9231729 we look at all of the control systems for console rts games the one we learned the most from was pikmin that was a very good strategy game

9231734 until three days ago i wasnt really happy with my performance here
9231735 the last match was one of the best matches ive ever bowled it was definitely a lot more fun for me
9231736 i finally figured out how to bowl well on the short pattern today
9231737 thats part of the game figuring out what to do and then executing
9231738 if you give these guys a long time they get things figured out and with a man like walter ray bar the doors
9231739 i couldnt be more pleased it was an incredible week with some unbelievable performances the matches were close and there was a lot of really really good bowling we worked awfully hard and these guys performed just beautifully
9231740 we were under a lot of pressure but the coach stuck with the players and this win feels good after the last three weeks
9231741 but the boks came at us with absolutely all guns blazing
9231742 andrew is disappointed but we need to keep high standards
9231743 andrew accepts our decision i know him pretty well and i hope he goes away from this and gets himself right and gets himself back into our team because hes a very important player and we certainly want him as part of our squad
9231744 its so hard to play for this team in my opinion we are the greatest sporting team in the world so we have standards and they might be higher than other teams
9231745 if you dont fulfil those standards unfortunately youre not going to be a part of our squad
9231746 i hope he doesnt take it personally because andrew is one of my closest mates so its certainly not personal
9231747 i guess thats why weve made this decision because we want andrew back in our team for as long as he wants to be a part
9231748 but right now for the best interests of the team and for the best interests of my friend andrew symonds i believe weve made the right decision
9231749 i believe when weve got such young impressionable faces in our team we need to make sure our senior blokes are 100 per cent spot on to the way they go about presenting themselves and that was an issue that wasnt being carried out with andrew

9231835 prices are more affected down south while new york is supplied through new york harbor
9231836 i think some of those areas are going to get hit hard again and its really going to squeeze people

9231945 in memory of my beautiful aunt and uncle whose lives were filled with so much love and service towards others
9231946 that night my dear friend robin and i laid down a rough track then after a day of sitting on it i knew i had to share this with whoever needed to hear this as a part of remembering the lives that have been lost as well as a part of this process of grieving too many times i think we avoid grief we want to move on from it as quickly as possible because its too painful or we feel like we have to be strong but as im realizing more and more we need to grieve and grieve well and to each person that will look different it definitely helps to have a great community of friends and family to help you grieve well and i want to thank all my dear friends who have helped me these past few days the phone calls the emails the listening ears the hugs and a special thanks to robin lai and victor lin piano who made this recording possible
9231947 through this process im learning more to allow myself to be fully angry at the ruthlessness of death and suffering and to arrive at a place of hope that death and suffering dont have the last word and thats the hope my aunt and uncle lived by and the hope they gave to others including me

9231970 kita tidak ingin melupakan kakek kita yang allah swt selamatkan mereka dari topan
9231971 wahai kaumku sembahlah allah yang tiada tuhan lain bagi kalian selain nya
9231972 apakah engkau ingin menjadi pemimpin bagi kami melalui dakwahmu ini imbalan apa yang engkau inginkan
9231973 bagaimana engkau menuduh tuhan tuhan kami yang kami mendapati ayah ayah kami menyembahnya
9231974 apakah engkau akan mengatakan wahai hud bahwa setelah kami mad dan menjadi tanah yang beterbangan di udara kita akan kembali hidup
9231975 kalian akan kembali pada hari kiamat dan allah swt akan bertanya kepada masing masing dari kalian tentang apa yang kalian lakukan
9231976 kemu dian apa pengertian adanya hari kiamat mengapa orang orang yang mati akan bangkit dari kematiannya
9231977 dan berkatalah pemuka pemuka yang kafir di antara kaumnya dan yang mendustakan pertemuan dengan hari kiamat kelak dan yang telah kami mewahkan mereka dalam kehidupan dunia orang ini tidak lain hanyalah manusia seperti kamu dia makan dari apa yang kamu makan dan meminum dari apa yang kamu minum
9231978 allah pencipta langit dan bumi dan bila dia berkehendak untuk menciptakan sesuatu maka cukuplah dia hanya mengatakan kepa danya
9231979 tidakkah nabi ini manusia biasa seperti kita ia memakan dari apa yang kita makan dan meminum dari apa yang kita minum bahkan barangkali karena kemiskinannya ia sedikit makan dari apa yang kita makan dan ia minum menggunakan gelas gelas yang kotor sementara kita minum dari gelas gelas yang terbuat dari emas dan perak maka bagaimana ia mengaku berada dalam kebenaran dan kita dalam kebatilan ini adalah manusia biasa maka bagaimana kita menaati manusia biasa seperti kita kemudian mengapa allah swt memilih manusia di antara kita untuk mendapatkan wahyu nya
9231980 bukankah hal yang aneh ketika allah swt memilih manusia biasa di antara kita untuk menerima wahyu dari nya
9231981 apa keanehan dalam hal itu sesungguhnya allah swt mencintai kalian dan oleh karenanya dia mengutus aku kepada kalian untuk mengingatkan kalian sesungguhnya perahu nuh dan kisah nuh tidak jauh dari ingatan kalian janganlah kalian melupakan apa yang telah terjadi orang orang yang menentang allah swt telah dihancurkan dan begitu juga orang orang yang akan mengingkari nya pun akan dihancurkan sekuat apa pun mereka

9231984 dan kami sekali kali tidak akan meninggalkan sembahan sembahan kami karena perkataanmu dan kami sekali kali tidak akan mempercayai kamu
9231985 sesungguhnya aku jadikan allah sebagai saksiku dan saksikanlah olehmu bahwa sesungguhnya aku berlepas diri dari apa yang kamu persekutukan dari selain nya
9231986 sesungguhnya allah swt murka kepada kalian jika kalian beriman maka allah swt akan rela terhadap kalian dan menurunkan hujan serta menambah kekuatan kalian
9231987 maka tatkala mereka melihat azab itu berupa awan yang menuju ke lembah lembah mereka berkatalah mereka inilah awan yang akan menurunkan hujan kepada kami bukan bahkan itulah azab yang kamu minta supaya datang dengan segera yaitu angin yang mengandung azab yang pedih yang menghancurkan segala sesuatu dengan perintah tuhannya
9231988 yang allah menimpakan angin itu kepada mereka selama tujuh malam dan delapan hari terus menerus maka kamu lihat kaum ad pada waktu itu mati bergelimpangan seakan akan mereka tunggul tunggul pohon kurma yang telah kosong lapuk

9231990 we showed the valencia of last year that finished 10th in the league is a thing of the past
9231991 the club wanted to keep me and i feel comfortable here so it is all fine it is just nice to get back to scoring goals
9231992 the team did well and we won so i am happy although we suffered far too much in the final few minutes
9231993 i made the decision hes under pressure from his entourage and not fit to play
9231994 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9231995 i have to play very well if i want to win
9231996 i will just focus on my next match because every match is difficult hes playing very well
9231997 he was putting serves bang on the line i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting once i broke him in the third set thats when i started to get my rhythm
9231998 this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going

9232006 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on my back nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round
9232007 for a while there was certainly a chance of 59 although i had 59 on my mind once i made that second eagle it didnt affect my golf
9232008 at the start of the day i just wanted to make the cut to make sure i got into next week i got off to a good start and it snowballed from there
9232009 im disappointed about the 59 but im certainly not disappointed about leading

9232083 as pessoas ficam julgando que s vou bem quando entro no segundo tempo mas como sempre falo na minha melhor fase no time eu era o titular afirmou
9232084 acho que a obedi ncia t tica foi o destaque do time conseguimos quebrar o passe do advers rio e manter o uma tima rela o no bloqueio defesa
9232085 fizemos uma boa partida mas ainda falhamos em detalhes soubemos aproveitar bem os contra ataques e para a pr xima partida teremos de caprichar ainda mais
9232086 a vit ria por 3 a 0 foi muito importante gostei da organiza o das atletas em quadra e especialmente do sistema defensivo
9232087 acho que vamos evoluir ainda mais e a partir de segunda feira vamos treinar em fun o do pinheiros
9232088 nosso objetivo tirar o ipatinga dessa situa o e nesses dois jogos n o tomamos nenhum gol isso importante e esperamos fazer outra bela partida contra o n utico
9232089 time foi determinado jogar aqui dif cil para caramba mas conseguimos bom resultado
9232090 s o dois jogos fora os meninos est o de parab ns e o grupo est muito bem
9232091 a gente chegou foi muito bem recebido pelo grupo e tudo que temos passado tem sido bem absorvido
9232092 o trabalho tende a fluir a cada dia que passa
9232093 n s tivemos oportunidades de contra ataques at de chegar mais frente e bloqueamos o time do vit ria que um grande time tem um grande treinador a gente sabia que seria dif cil
9232094 no contexto geral foi bom o grupo vem ganhando corpo e na hora certa a bola vai entrar dif cil estar nas ltimas coloca es com a obriga o sempre de ganhar e esse grupo est reagindo bem
9232095 est vamos com a vantagem mas n o marcamos bem no gol deles esse empate foi uma derrota para o nosso grupo em minha opini o aconteceu uma falha de marca o
9232096 foi o segundo gol de bola parada que levamos contra o vasco aconteceu o mesmo demos bobeira pois achamos que a vit ria estava garantida agora precisamos trabalhar para nos recuperarmos
9232097 no final do jogo perdemos o gian a equipe est de parab ns o importante somar esse foi um ponto agora temos um jogo mais dif cil contra o n utico fora de casa agora ir l e conseguir mais um bom resultado n o podemos perder para depois jogar em casa e ganhar
9232098 n o adianta mais s vencer em casa tem de buscar fora tamb m dif cil jogar aqui o vit ria est brigando pelo g 4 mas foi um jogo igual l gico que com mais posse de bola do vit ria mas um contra ataque nosso poderia matar o jogo
9232099 a nossa equipe est de parab ns fomos todos guerreiros dentro de campo desde o come o mas levamos um gol e tivemos a infelicidade de perder um jogador conseguimos nos recompor e trabalhamos forte dentro de campo para conquistar pelo menos o empate
9232100 diante das circunst ncias posso falar que o gol acabou nos beneficiando entramos nervosos no primeiro tempo e depois do gol sofrido acordamos e conseguimos empatar a partida importante destacar a estrat gia adotada pelo roberto que fez com que o time conseguisse chegar junto no jogo
9232101 nos portamos muito bem taticamente no jogo de hoje diante das dificuldades esse empate foi de muito bom tamanho agrade o por mais uma oportunidade recebida no jogo de hoje e pelo gol marcado no fim do jogo
9232102 um resultado ruim n s tivemos dois tempos distintos nos quais ficou claro que o bragantino se posicionou bem e iria jogar em cima dos erros e no contra ataque depois do gol de p nalti insistimos em jogar pelo meio afunilando o jogo conversamos isso na prele o mas n o cumprimos e acabamos pagando o pre o
9232103 todos conhecem a qualidade do souza e sabiam que com o tempo ele seria titular do gr mio n o me incomodo de marcar porque mesmo assim vamos continuar com um bom setor de cria o
9232104 esse time est equilibrado e em condi es de fazer uma grande atua o contra o vasco e obter um resultado positivo
9232105 esse um momento hist rico um presente dessa gera o para as futuras o palmeiras entrou hoje em uma nova era
9232106 eu acho que esse empate tem um pouquinho de cada uma dessas palavras considero que esse foi o primeiro trope o do botafogo sob o meu comando
9232107 tomamos um gol no final contra o vasco e agora empatamos com o n utico temos que treinar um pouco mais essa jogada de bola a rea na rea porque ela esta nos complicando

9232137 on a personal level it was satisfying to get a game
9232138 but it wouldve been better to play in a winning side when youre trying to cement your spot that part was disappointing
9232139 a few times i watched the boys warming up before games and i thought i was a long way away
9232140 on a personal note its been a pretty tough year thats all ive really done this year is try and battle to get my spot back and try to get that chance
9232141 my main role was to be defensive and try to stop my man which i thought i didnt do too badly and hopefullly ill get another chance next week

9232201 mrupert i find it interesting that a movie about loving and accepting people despite their differences could be considered in anyway anti christian to me it says a lot about how far some christians have moved from the core messages of christ
9232202 a supportive community that reinforces abstinence from some of the more destructive vices
9232203 i don t think melissa or the authors of the study are claiming anything like existence of god from this study simply a correlational relationship of church going
9232204 of course a parent s decision to practice a religion may coincide with other traits like self discipline community involvement and mentoring skills all of which will likely affect a child s upbringing
9232205 organized institutions requiring discipline self sacrifice and conformity to norms of behavior
9232206 we generally find much weaker buffering effects for other social organizations
9232207 the bottom line is this is one study that suggests some positive influences of religion on a child
9232208 however the results were not always positive for instance disadvantaged children from religious families did not fare better in income health healthcare or psychological well being
9232209 having such parents did not make a statistically significant reduction in the likelihood that a child would escape poverty by adulthood luttmer said
9232210 we generally find much weaker buffering effects for other social organizations
9232211 has their ever been a person who blew themselves up killed a doctor destroyed a home in the name of atheism
9232212 why are you mad that a religion can create a community which improves the lives of the disadvantaged

9232214 a green winter will global warming be good for canada
9232215 what should we be putting into the heads of our children
9232216 socialistic political messages you can t seriously be saying that global warming is a socialist initiative
9232217 dix you seem to just assume that reducing global warming must have a high economic cost this has rarely been the case in such situations
9232218 reducing consumption by raising the price would have a dampening factor on the economy and productivity but that is rarely the right solution
9232219 many times the problem has been lack of incentive for industry to come up with any solutions regulation can often make matters worse

9232235 often people go to the museums and then to the red light district

9232237 but there is still a lot of abuse and trafficking of women
9232238 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9232239 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9232240 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9232241 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9232242 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9232243 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing
9232244 the initial agreement has been signed and we are waiting to see the approval of both governments

9232249 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us

9232252 think blink or sleep on it the impact of modes of thought on complex decision making
9232253 if you have to make decisions you have to do your homework
9232254 i did some research to try to figure out why the dutch had been able to see differences we hadnt
9232255 both cars in the experiment were equal so i would expect roughly equal numbers of the subjects to chose each car
9232256 its overly bold to recommend that as a way of making decisions
9232257 but that doctor has 20 to 30 years of experience and has in the past employed deliberate decision making so maybe over time these decisions become automated
9232258 going with your gut may be right when youre an expert for example maybe choosing lunch every day is easy because we do it every day but we dont move every day so when making a choice about where to live we have no expertise
9232259 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9232260 our focus is really on this side of the river
9232261 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9232262 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9232263 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9232264 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9232265 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9232266 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9232267 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9232268 the problem is there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9232269 let me tell you the reason i picked joe biden
9232270 number three is somebody who i know in his heart cares about the american people and the american dream and is willing to fight for them as hard as he can and joe biden fit that bill
9232271 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9232272 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9232273 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9232274 my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this election is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country
9232275 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9232276 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9232277 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9232278 once the storm gets into the gulf i think thats when were going to see another surge of people seeking to evacuate
9232279 we need to get them out of the way so we can deal with our senior citizens and those who need our assistance
9232280 if you decide to stay you will be required to stay inside of your property
9232281 emotionally can we handle it i think there is a lot of fragileness about our psyche right now in this city
9232282 i wouldnt be honest with you if i told you something different
9232283 its going to be a tough but new orleaneans are very resilient and they are very tough and well get through this
9232284 i was there yesterday met with the mayor met with the governor its the best preparedness ive seen im very proud of what theyve done in the last couple of years to get not only the city but the entire state ready
9232285 so the governor and the mayor and the parish called for evacuations
9232286 were asking people to pay close attention to that when called to evacuate please evacuate
9232287 what youre seeing is a total culture change in not only how this organization is going to respond but how the states and local communities are going to respond
9232288 if people living there are asked to evacuate they should not depend on the levees
9232289 evacuate take shelter and come back to the city after the storms over
9232290 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9232291 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9232292 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9232293 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9232294 we have gone from a reactive organization to a proactive organization
9232295 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm
9232296 we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9232297 i wasnt expecting a at the end that was really great to find out what the was youll have to read his story

9232342 i respect the decision of the seneca nation of indians based on the information provided to me
9232343 i still believe that this 333 million project which will create over 1 000 jobs will be a benefit to the city of buffalo and i look forward to working with the seneca nation to get the project back up and running
9232344 perhaps this decision is the beginning of a discussion we can have with the senecas over the disposition of this lawsuit
9232345 in keeping with our financial commitments to our owner the seneca nation of indians and with our obligations to our bondholders

9232356 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9232357 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9232358 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9232359 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9232360 not to belittle alaska but its different than the basket of issues you deal with in big dynamic states
9232361 heres a governor who may have served two years but her accomplishments are worth eight
9232362 shes got as much experience for being vice president as barack does to be president
9232363 yes yes bravo but that will mean little if you keep dropping your elbow
9232364 mary will never marry she will die an old maid with only old fordyce for company
9232365 at least she hasnt married because she has no wish to sometimes i despair of ever finding a beau
9232366 no of course not but i think my father has been growing suspicious
9232367 you havent given him any reason to suspect have you
9232368 only that he has been wondering more often when i became so severe i was always fond of studying mr white but hardly to the extreme i pretend now
9232369 and be rest assured that their musings will go nowhere i am no favorite of my father or mother
9232370 you speak of them as though they would not be distressed if you died
9232371 why mr white i do believe youve grown to like me that is the first time that you have mentioned my premature death as a question of if rather than when
9232372 a few years happiness mary you do not think you are undeserving
9232373 mr white up until the last year you spoke to me of duty and destiny that my death was a matter of when and sooner rather than later what can have happened to make you forget the unavoidable facts of this calling
9232374 mary i can no longer be contented with only knowing you at night with only knowing your strength and nothing else not that these things are not attractive and for awhile i was made happy by these things but now i wish to know all of you
9232375 i think i should have liked being married to you mr white
9232376 as long as they keep a good attitude everything will be okay
9232377 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work

9232390 i was never really in danger so it was actually pretty good for me
9232391 i knew the longer the match would go the more tired he would get so it was a good match for me
9232392 when i need to step it up thats what i do
9232393 for me it was very important mentally to survive that first set when i was 6 2 and he came back and had set point and the serve
9232394 it could go either way but these tough matches make you stronger mentally so you can use that experience for the future
9232395 he was definitely out playing me for the first two sets
9232396 i felt like a little kid out here playing against him then the clock struck 12 and i felt a lot better playing out here as a 26 year old

9232401 industrially produced fiction has become one of the primary shapers of our emotions and our intellect in the twentieth century although these fictional stories are supposed to entertain us they constantly give us a secret education we are not only taught certain styles of violence the latest fashions and sex roles by tv movies magazines and comic strips we are taught how to succeed how to love how to buy how to conquer how to forget the past and suppress the future we are taught more than anything else how not to rebel

9232406 its this self aggrandizing self esteem rather than genuinely feeling really good about yourself
9232407 theres this sort of underlying insecurity to it and competitiveness
9232408 to the extent that it allows us to survive it does that by helping us maintain our social relationships with others sort of maintain our place in the social hierarchy
9232409 a given person with high implicit or inner self esteem may be outwardly self promoting or may be outwardly very modest
9232410 it does not make much sense to argue that japanese have lower or negative self esteem
9232411 because at the implicit level japanese hold comparable or higher self esteem than americans
9232412 it may be that parents in all societies especially mothers adore their children and put them on a pedestal so that children worldwide absorb a highly positive self concept
9232413 ordinary east asians are aware that they hold strongly positive self views
9232414 but the prevalent modesty norm prevents them from expressing it publicly

9233067 the only reason she is mad that someone said that is because she is so insecure and shes afraid to admit how right everyone is about her
9233068 ive found that the safest place i know is in my own mind
9233069 i said i might just be writing my career off right now
9233070 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9233071 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9233072 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9233073 but i do believe there will be certain assets that as we are already looking at the picture right now well be able to recommend can be either redeployed or not deployed to the theater in the fall

9233080 set out each day believing in your dreams know without a doubt that you were made for amazing things
9233081 im dealing with a very difficult very personal issue and i know this is not the solution
9233082 i said i might just be writing my career off right now
9233083 ive had 17 great years and theres no guarantee what the future holds but you wont know unless you take that chance and i was thinking that
9233084 i think now that im here that part is over and done with
9233085 no one in that locker room is worried about it not once has a guy said hey sit down and tell me what happened they may want to know or whatever but were too busy and im having a blast
9233086 its been hard but really i know i made the right decision
9233087 everyday i would wake up and say boy id like to play at some point in the day id go ahh i dont know with each day that passed i got more and more committed to do it and that was all i was looking for from day 1
9233088 as time passed by i said you know ive still got the fire
9233089 i finally got to a point where i was committed and to me that includes everything
9233090 ive always considered myself the ultimate teammate regardless of how ive been portrayed this year
9233091 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9233092 i said no im not sure but you want an answer and im giving you an answer im not sure
9233093 now i couldve told them all right ill come back even though at that time i didnt want to
9233094 and then july rolls around and we start camp and i go god i just aint got it and then just walk away well to me that was worse than saying guys if you want an answer right now im just not 100 percent committed and because of that im retiring i was just honest with them
9233095 i always liked ted and i dont want to say i dislike him now
9233096 what the hell am i going to do with a locker anyway
9233097 i started getting the impression in may that boy i feel like i need to play
9233098 the tough part was how do i get myself out of this jam
9233099 when he picked up the phone again after he dropped it he said oh god brett
9233100 he said brett playing here is not an option those were his exact exact words
9233101 theres no guarantees i come back and i play as well as i did last year but if youre a betting man and you said ok who gives us the best chance to win right now and this is not bragging but i would think i would
9233102 aaron may play great and then they all look like geniuses but to not welcome me back and im just assuming for fear of upsetting aaron not only now but in the future is totally ridiculous totally ridiculous
9233103 the next day i told him mike dont worry about coming down or dropping by
9233104 they made it sound like they had chartered a plane just to see me and i had made a call and said im coming back which is not true
9233105 mike called me on the phone and i couldnt get him to shut up
9233106 i didnt want to go anywhere including green bay and go through a bad season and lose and get beat up and everyone say what the hell did he come back for
9233107 now that could happen here it could happen in green bay and it could happen anywhere ive always felt like i give whatever team im on a good chance to win but theres way more to it than one guy
9233108 the bottom line was that i wanted to play and i felt like this team had a good chance to win it would be difficult as it would be anywhere but i felt like this would be a good fit for me

9233120 i played that close personal tie card and the woman was like thats nice
9233121 this is so apparent why mention it why include it in the great volume of negotiating secrets as if saying the price of gas is expensive isnt obvious enough
9233122 it came to a head because he missed the meeting yesterday
9233123 i guess the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team in my opinion and i know in the rest of the leadership groups opinion you need to be committed 100 percent thats all facets of being an international cricketer
9233124 we believe for the best interests of this team for the best interests of andrew symonds is for him to have time away from the game and lets try and get him right as soon as possible to get him back in our team
9233125 andrew was obviously very disappointed he accepts our decision i hope he goes away from this and gets himself right and gets himself back into our team because he is a very important player and we want him as a part of our squad
9233126 theres got to be consistency in the group and youve got to stand for something you cant have players doing that sort of stuff
9233127 hes got to have a good look at what hes doing for sure hes got to re assess where hes at if hes doing these things its not the first time
9233128 i havent spoken to andrew in detail so its very hard for me to defend him
9233129 the statement this morning mentioned that cricket australia was concerned about andrews well being
9233130 i dont think that sounds like a case of his contract being torn up
9233131 its a decision thats been made by the senior player group theyre concerned about his well being thats my understanding
9233132 the concern is to work with andrew to ensure that we get him back in harness for the next 12 months
9233133 michaels clarke concern is that he is as fully committed to playing international cricket as he needs his players to be

9233213 many people dont realise how dangerous bonbs and high explosives can be
9233214 and now bad they can be for the environment tnt and rdx generate toxic gases that pollute the environment when they explode while unexploded ordnance is highly toxic it can leach out harmful forms of carbon that poison the ground and affect the people who handle it
9233215 however we believe weve now solved this problem by creating a new and safer type of bomb its based on a newly developed class of materials called tetrazoles which derive most of their explosive energy from nitrogen instead of carbon so theyre much better for the environent weve already made tiny bombs from tetrazoles called hbt and g2zt which are not only more stable and less toxic than conventional explosives but more powerful too true they do generate hydrogen cyanide but were working on that problem and soon expect to have a range of completely safe and environmentally friendly compounds designed for especially large calibre naval and tank guns
9233216 its ok were killing kids but at least weve reduced our carbon footprint by 70 percent

9233228 even those of us who supported other candidates are four square behind john mccain
9233229 when i saw the e mail confirming palins selection i was like wow weve really got a complete ticket the democratic ticket is all about making history but our ticket is about leadership experience and making history so we sort of kill two birds with one stone
9233230 its kind of a shock i think shes in a little over her head
9233231 but i think of anybody shes the kind of person who can rise to an occasion
9233232 she handles tough questions well its hard to get elected to be a woman and get elected in alaska
9233233 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9233234 i think john mccain won the state of alaska but lost the nation
9233235 i think her inexperience is going to cause many many voters to think twice before voting for him
9233236 we believe this is a right way forward and we will be open and co operative
9233237 you gotta know what youre voting on if you dont know that its not going to do you any good
9233238 this is the strongest offer in the aerospace industry it includes pension increases lump sum payments
9233239 i think for people my age its not a bad deal
9233240 but for the younger people theyre the ones that are going to be losing things
9233241 i dont know if theyve just come to accept the fact that they dont have retirement
9233242 and if they dont read the contract theyll just keep taking away stuff until they dont have retirement which is what they want they want to take away their retirements
9233243 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer

9233249 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri and then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i was upset about
9233250 i like nasri very much hes a player we looked at for a possible signing last year but you cant do things like that if it had been the other way round and a newcastle player had done that i wonder what the reaction would be
9233251 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card i will tell the same thing when i see him and i told nasri that at the end as well the fact is that joey has done nothing wrong
9233252 nasri clipped barton and there was a little incident between but he was booked and rightly so
9233253 we had great balance movement and penetration we were in control and we played the game that we love and the game that we can play at our best
9233254 we could have scored more goals but im also pleased that we didnt concede
9233255 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9233256 and i am also scared to spend a lot of money after listening to
9233257 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9233258 our focus is really on this side of the river
9233259 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9233260 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9233261 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment

9233272 this article will focus on those procedures which may lead to false allegations of sexual abuse by focusing on false allegations i will be emphasizing what i believe are the weaknesses in the present system of identifying sexual abuse in children my personal opinion is that the vast majority of sexual abuse allegations are true and that the dedication of the experts that i am critical of in this article has resulted in the conviction of sex offenders who might otherwise have gone free to abuse other children so much deserved praise has been given these experts that i do not feel the need to say more however there has been so little deserved criticism of these experts that i do feel the need to criticize those procedures that can lead to false accusations of sexual abuse false accusations can be devastating both to the innocently accused and to the child incorrectly diagnosed as a sexual abuse victim

9233434 imaging practices focused on cardiac ct have very particular needs when it comes to interpretation software
9233435 studies are several times larger than typical radiology examinations and multiple users require concurrent access to the full diagnostic tool set but via an affordable and flexible licensing model in addition distribution of interactive 3d results to referring physicians is a powerful aid to demonstrating the value and convenience of ct technology as a complement to existing diagnostic paradigms in cardiology
9233436 it is now possible to purchase a server for two cardiac users at a price point competitive with the single workstation usually included in a ct scanner purchase
9233437 access for additional users can then be purchased as required without a need for re training or a change in deployment strategy the system is capable of opening studies comprised of over 6000 slices to accommodate the most demanding clinical needs and includes all available clinical functionality without compromises representing an unmatched value in the marketplace today in todays cardiac ct environment there is virtually no case where a single workstation with a ct or mr scanner is adequate to meet the clinical need and by combining multiple users with the flexibility of true client server architecture we are confident this product will be very popular as an alternative to the advanced visualization offerings normally bundled with imaging modalities
9233438 with the aquarius intuition server terarecon offers the highest single server capacity available on the market today for the largest number of concurrent users accessing the largest ct examinations with all cardiac tools available
9233439 this is a direct and important benefit afforded by terarecons unique technology platform which despite many attempts no gpu or cpu based solution has been able to match

9233560 im the next ronald reagan im the true conservative im pro life in fact i have a 100 pro life voting record
9233561 id love to see a point where roe vs wade is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe vs wade which would then force women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
9233562 has a 17 year voting record of supporting efforts to overturn roe vs wade he does that currently and will continue to do that as president
9233563 in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe vs wade which would then force x number of women in american to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
9233564 i dont believe they should advocate abortion with my tax dollars
9233565 i think that i would give the benefit of the doubt to the person who alleges that
9233566 we now have a global picture of induced abortion in the world covering both countries where it is legal and countries where laws are very restrictive
9233567 what we see is that the law does not influence a womans decision to have an abortion if theres an unplanned pregnancy it does not matter if the law is restrictive or liberal
9233568 generally where abortion is legal it will be provided in a safe manner
9233569 and the opposite is also true where it is illegal it is likely to be unsafe performed under unsafe conditions by poorly trained providers
9233570 in the past we didnt have this kind of data to draw on
9233571 these numbers are not definitive and very susceptible to interpretation according to the agenda of the people who are organizing the data
9233572 they have equated the word safe with legal and unsafe with illegal which gives you the illusion that to deal with serious medical system problems you just make abortion legal
9233573 the truth is sometimes a poor competitor in the marketplace of ideas complicated unsatisfying full of dilemmas always vulnerable to misinterpretation and abuse

9233608 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9233609 i think in ketchikan theres still quite a bit of concern about the palin administration
9233610 number one we dont think were nowhere and number two when she campaigned in ketchikan she was supportive of the project
9233611 palin said ketchikan had taken a lot of heat for the bridge to nowhere proposal she said she can relate referencing the remark made by sen ben stevens describing mat su residents as valley trash
9233612 ok youve got valley trash standing in the middle of nowhere palin said
9233613 she hasnt communicated with us or spent any time with us the people who helped get her elected are shocked
9233614 shes alienated a lot of the republican base here in ketchikan
9233615 theres always tomorrow and the state has a huge amount of money
9233616 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer
9233617 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9233618 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened

9233624 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
9233625 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
9233626 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
9233627 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
9233628 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
9233629 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter

9233646 bernard kouchner spoke expressly against the sanctions with which i agree to some extent as sanctions usually do not have any major results
9233647 this will be aired at the discussion on monday however the french policy is not considering them
9233648 resolute diplomatic steps should be taken now it is quite necessary to keep a united eu stand if russia sees that the eu is united on the affair this will help it more than if any sanctions were imposed however one can also hear other voices

9233652 he was a nice man and hes been a friend of ours for about 4 years
9233653 he called me yesterday thursday morning i didnt know that would be the last time i would talk to him
9233654 he said he had his enemies but he wasnt afraid of them
9233655 what he done for a living was repo vehicles and he probably had a lot of enemies i mean you do when you start repoing i know hes told me hes been shot at and everything like that repo and stuff he said you just jump in one vehicle and take off as soon as you can because you never know

9233669 one way to recollect the mind easily in the time of prayer and preserve it more in tranquillity is not to let it wander too far at other times you should keep it strictly in the presence of god and being accustomed to think of him often you will find it easy to keep your mind calm in the time of prayer or at least to recall it from its wanderings

9233708 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
9233709 tensions between russia and the west were ratcheted even higher today after moscow warned that the american naval build up in the black sea could be seen as a declaration of war
9233710 normally battleships do not deliver aid and this is battleship diplomacy this does not make the situation more stable
9233711 despite the apparent strength of the nato naval group in the black sea a single salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or thee missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group within twenty minutes the waters would be clear
9233712 are going to be bored because im going to give some back story that you know better than i do
9233713 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together
9233714 now the story starts really in 1992 when this fuse was lit in georgia
9233715 now theres two territories theres abkhazia which has clearly defined administrative borders and theres south ossetia that doesnt before the troubles started abkhazia was an extremely ethnically mixed area about 60 percent georgian 20 percent abkhaz and 20 percent assorted others greeks estonians armenians jews what have you in ossetia it was a completely integrated and completely mixed ossetian georgian population the ossetians and the georgians have never been apart in the sense that they were living in their own little villages and doing their own little things there has been inter marriage and a sense of common understanding going back to distant history the georgians will tell you about king tamar thats a woman but they called her a king and she was married to an ossetian so the fuse was lit and two wars start one in abkhazia and one in south ossetia
9233716 it was also lit in tbilisi there was a guy in charge here zviad gamsakhurdia a little bit like serbian nationalist war criminal in bosnia radovan karadzic he was a poet he was an intellectual but he was one of these guys who veered off into ethnic exclusivism he made stupid declarations like georgia is only for the georgians if youre running a multi ethnic country that is really not a clever thing to say the central control of the state was extremely weak the russians were trying to make things worse there was a civil war between georgians and tbilisi but the key thing is that here there were militias georgian militias and some of them pretty nasty
9233717 this guy zviad gamsakhurdia was driven from power from across the street they bombed this place
9233718 of course he led the government in exile until he came back in 1993 then died obscurely in the mountains of suicide some people say others say cancer then he was buried in grozny
9233719 things here explode and basically it gets pretty nasty thomas can tell you what happened
9233720 youve got two bits of abkhazia which are not ethnic abkhazia
9233721 the first thing that misha mikheil saakashvili did was try to poke his finger in russian president vladimir putins eyes as many times as possible
9233722 most notably by wanting to join nato the west in my view mishandled this situation america gave the wrong signals so did europe
9233723 but basically the encouragement was given despite stronger and stronger russian signals that a georgian accession to
9233724 just a little bit of back story again in july of 2007 russia withdrew from the conventional forces treaty in europe this is a soviet era treaty that dictates where
9233725 one provocation was to use the russian media to launch shrill accusations that the georgian army was in kodori preparing for an invasion of abkhazia now if you go up there i took a bunch of journalists up there a few times when you get to the actual checkpoint you have a wall of crumbling rock a wooden bridge another wall of crumbling rock a raging torrent and a steep mountainside filled with woods its not possible to invade out or invade in unless youve got air support which is why the abkhaz were never able to kick these georgians out they just kept that bit of territory
9233726 the next provocation on april 16 putin signs a presidential decree recognizing the documents of abkhazians and south ossetians in russia and vice versa
9233727 starting in mid july the russians launched the biggest military exercise in the north caucasus that theyve held since the chechnya war
9233728 on august 3 the head of the local administration says hes evacuating his civilians
9233729 on top of that for the last four years the russians have been dishing out passports to anyone who asks in those areas
9233730 so back to the 3rd of august kokoity announces women and children should leave as it later turned out he made all the civilians leave who were not fighting or did not have fighting capabilities on the same day irregulars ingush chechen ossetians and cossacks start coming in and spreading out into the countryside but dont do anything they just sit and wait on the 6th of august the shelling intensifies from ossetian positions and for the first time since the war finished in 1992 they are using 120mm guns
9233731 because of the peace agreement they had nobody was allowed to have guns bigger than 80mm okay so thats the formal start of the war it wasnt the attack on tskhinvali now stop me
9233732 a new status quo has been created in the area
9233733 it is our understanding the russian head of state noted that after what has happened in tskhinval and what has been planned for abkhazia they have the right to decide their destiny by themselves
9233734 consequently you are no longer foreigners and aliens but fellow citizens with gods people and members of gods household
9233735 christs teachings are as practical today as they were when he walked in the gallilee
9233736 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose to be conformed to the image of his son
9233737 for those called by the creator according to his purpose and who love him circumstances in these persons lives will work to mold them into christ like persons
9233738 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works that these shall he do because i to unto my father
9233739 now we see through a mirror darkly a poor reflection in a poor mirror
9233740 i really hope this will be a way to expose the real danger we all are facing globally iran usa and russia hand in hand bringing the third world war
9233741 ahmadinejads mother is a jew and from the establishment of islamic republic in 1979 the crypto jews were in the highest position in decision making in the state

9233754 no one knows whether sarah palin could be a competent president which shows how highly political and potentially reckless this choice is
9233755 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9233756 republicans rightfully have criticized the democratic nominee sen barack obama for his lack of experience but palin is a neophyte in comparison
9233757 governor palins lack of experience especially in national security and foreign affairs raises immediate questions about how prepared she is to potentially succeed to the presidency
9233758 senator mccain has not only succeeded in unifying our party but also in generating great enthusiasm
9233759 but the olympic athletes they are real role models this is the america we like to see
9233760 shes shown a woman can run companies can lead philanthropic organizations can do really anything
9233761 i just want you to know that your husband is seeing my wife
9233762 if you love her and you want to make this work then you need to go home and be with her
9233763 she said that she yelled something like terry wait and this was at about the same time as she pushed on the door to try to get into the bathroom and at the same time she heard a shot
9233764 i fell in love with cheryl the first time we met
9233765 i let someone come between you i which should have never happened
9233766 i look back on everything see where i gave up love companion ship for attention affection it would be wonderful if i could turn back our lives for the past four years
9233767 if you live gods will and give with a happy heart you will reap the rewards
9233768 do you remember where you were 13 years ago on this day
9233769 he just wasnt the happy go lucky guy id known all my life
9233770 to keep cheryl in the style she wants to live
9233771 i always thought my uncle was in pretty good financial standing
9233772 it was just a shock to me that his finances were in that bad condition
9233773 one day she hates you and one day she loves you and the next day she hates you
9233774 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri and then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i was upset about
9233775 i like nasri very much hes a player we looked at for a possible signing last year but you cant do things like that if it had been the other way round and a newcastle player had done that i wonder what the reaction would be
9233776 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card i will tell arsene wenger the same thing when i see him and i told nasri that at the end as well the fact is that joey has done nothing wrong
9233777 nasri clipped barton and there was a little incident between but he was booked and rightly so
9233778 we had great balance movement and penetration we were in control and we played the game that we love and the game that we can play at our best
9233779 we could have scored more goals but im also pleased that we didnt concede
9233780 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9233781 and i am also scared to spend a lot of money after listening to british chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling he is announcing a terrible financial hurricane is coming to england so maybe we shouldnt spend too much

9234076 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9234077 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9234078 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9234079 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9234080 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9234081 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9234082 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9234083 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9234084 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9234085 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9234086 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9234087 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9234088 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9234089 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9234090 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9234091 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9234092 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9234093 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9234094 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9234095 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9234096 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9234097 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9234098 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9234099 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9234103 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
9234104 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9234105 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

9234109 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9234110 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9234111 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9234112 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9234113 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9234114 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9234115 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9234116 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9234117 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9234118 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9234119 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini

9234131 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9234132 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9234133 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9234134 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9234135 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9234136 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9234137 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9234138 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9234139 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9234140 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9234141 its been crazy but its been fun because in practice you go in and go through all the reps and you try to make all the throws and when you step on the game field everything slows down
9234142 the crowd is loud but you block everything out and you just play ball and im going to get the opportunity tomorrow to just go out and play ball
9234143 bishop is just fitting into the mold that i expected from him
9234144 he has shown the ability and inclination to step in and be a leader he has worked very hard at picking up the offence he has been good on the field athletically mentally and emotionally so hes done the things that i hoped he would do
9234145 hes certainly a more mobile quarterback than marcus crandell would have been he probably has the strongest arm in the cfl and hes a proven winner and he knows how to win football games
9234146 id like to say hed be all frazzled and disjointed and unaware of the playbook but we had that one year when rocky butler came off the bench and took us apart here
9234147 sometimes its just that you get a spark from being in a new system and on a new team and you cant do anything wrong in the biggest of big games
9234148 we hope to take that away from him but were going to have our work cut out for us
9234149 with bishop in there theyre definitely going to have to stay honest and assign somebody to him
9234150 so yeah it should open up some lanes for me
9234151 im dealing with a very difficult very personal issue and i know this is not the solution

9234158 a lot of people in the activist community are really on pins and needles about whos next
9234159 our organization will continue we will be on the streets
9234160 we spent so much time trying to welcome people to the city and now this is the way we start out
9234161 i fought hard to save this little boys life but nobody would help me
9234162 so i was fighting a fight by myself which ended with me losing my grandson and my daughter where she is now
9234163 i loved this baby more than anything in my life
9234164 for him to die the way he died is eating up my heart
9234165 just because i wasnt there the whole time that i wasnt there to help him to save him
9234166 i want to protect you from all harm but i have to let you grow and learn on your own
9234167 remember no matter what whether things are good or bad i want you to know youre my son and i love you forever and ever
9234168 we would not like to think that it was the will of god what happened to this boy
9234169 i would like to think that this boy died for us this baby has left a message here for the whole world
9234170 an end time army has one common purpose to aggressively take ground for the kingdom of god under the authority of jesus christ the dread champion
9234171 the trumpet is sounding calling on fire revolutionary believers to enlist in joels army many are now ready to be mobilized to establish and advance gods kingdom on earth
9234172 the pitch and intensity of the military rhetoric of this branch of the global dominionist movement has substantially increased since the beginning of 2008
9234173 one can only wonder how long before this transforms into real warfare with actual warriors
9234174 get busy in constructing a bible based social political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of god
9234175 such leaders prefer more authoritarian structures where their own word or decrees are unchallenged
9234176 everyone born after abortions legalization can consider their birth a personal invitation to take part in this great army
9234177 as the church begins to take on this resolve they joels army churches will start to be thought of more as military bases and they will begin to take on the characteristics of military bases for training equipping and deploying effective spiritual forces
9234178 in time the church will actually be organized more as a military force with an army navy air force etc
9234179 some pastors and leaders who continue to resist this tide of unity will be removed from their place some will become so hardened they will become opposers and resist god to the end
9234180 i am thinking god why is the power of god not moving and he said it is because you havent kicked that women in the face and there was like this older lady worshipping right in front of the platform and the holy spirit spoke to me and the gift of faith came on me he said kick her in the face with your biker boot i inched closer and i went like this makes kicking motion bam and just as my boot made contact with her nose she fell under the power of god
9234181 i believe were headed to an elijah jezebel showdown on the earth not just in america but all over the globe and the main warriors will be the prophets of baal versus the prophets of god and there will be no middle ground
9234182 theres an elijah generation thats going to be the forerunners for the coming of jesus a generation marked not by their niceness but by the intensity of their passion
9234183 the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force such force demands an equal response and jesus is going to make war on everything that hinders love with his eyes blazing fire

9234201 saya tidak bisa membayangkan apa yang akan dikatakan oleh kaum muslimin jika mereka mendengar cerita cerita di abad pertengahan dan mengerti apa yang biasa dikatakan oleh ahli pidato kristen dalam hymne hymne mereka semua hymne kami bahkan hymne yang muncul sebelum abad ke 12 berasal dari konsep yang merupakan akibat dari perang salib hymne hymne itu dipenuhi oleh kebencian kepada kaum muslimin dikarenakan ketidakpedulian mereka terhadap agamanya akibat dari hymne dan nyanyian itu kebencian terhadap agama itu tertancap di benak mereka dan kekeliruan ide menjadi berakar yang beberapa diantaranya masih terbawa hingga saat ini tiap orang menganggap muslim sebagai orang musyrik tidak beriman pemuja berhala dan murtad
9234202 bukankah karena khilafah islam dan ulama yang menyebabkan para petani turki berperang hingga mati selama lima abad sudah waktunya turki mengurus urusannya sendiri dan mengabaikan orang india dan orang arab turki harus melepaskan dirinya untuk memimpin kaum muslimin
9234203 kita harus mengakhiri apapun yang akan membawa persatuan islam diantara anak anak kaum muslimin sebagaimana yang kita telah sukses laksanakan dalam mengakhiri khilafah maka kita harus memastikan bahwa tidak pernah ada lagi bangkitnya persatuan kaum muslimin apakah itu persatuan intelektual dan budaya

9234257 she can relate to our struggles and our own lives
9234258 but having said that one thing i do know is that people made the mistake of underestimating her at least underestimating that ability to connect with people
9234259 there were no public policy initiatives no grasp of public policy but people loved her
9234260 but that took it out of the realm of the poseur and established a great deal of trust with voters

9234288 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
9234289 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
9234290 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics

9234292 we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico

9234297 im a huge fan of the clintons i love hillary i love bill they hit home runs out the park i was so excited when bill was speaking it reminded me of why i love him hes articulate so smart greatest president of our era when he was here we had peace yasser arafat of palestine and the prime minister of israel shaking hands and hugging bringing peace in the middle east not war everybody had jobs the economy was growing george bush and the republicans turned the whole country around to where our dollar is worth half the euro dollar your man john mccain wants to continue the same tactics of the bush organization why should my man daddy yankee be endorsing mccain this is the only urban guy in the universe to endorse john mccain you got people who look up to yankee young teenagers that look up to him and might make the wrong choice john mccain is the wrong thing to do i dont think the republicans care much about minorities i cant believe yankee went and endorsed this guy
9234298 i travel the world doing shows and people hate the united states because of the policies of george bush

9234587 aw your head is the perfect height for my chin
9234588 were going to have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9234589 ive been talking to all of them but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9234590 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9234591 like all americans our prayers are with those who will be affected by hurricane gustav
9234592 we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9234593 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9234594 in a nutshell the doctrine stands for expanding the search for domestic oil and gas as a solution to the energy crisis
9234595 i wouldnt call it a nightmare but it is a very perplexing challenge
9234596 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9234597 but john mccain refused to support loan guarantees for the auto industry now hes just paying lip service not talking straight and mccain voted repeatedly for tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas selling out american workers we just cant afford more of the same
9234598 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time
9234599 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9234600 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9234601 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers
9234602 and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9234603 scrantons a place that never leaves you it becomes part of your heart
9234604 barack obama learned the same lesson while being raised by a single mom and his grandparents
9234605 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9234606 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9234607 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9234608 he doesnt look like the other presidents you see on money
9234609 mccains choice allowed him to wrest media attention from obama whose speech in front of a crowd of 80 000 in denver on thursday night is believed to be the most watched convention speech ever nielsen media research said it averaged 38 4 million us viewers across all major networks reaching nearly a quarter of all us households it easily eclipsed the acceptance speeches of both of obamas two immediate democratic predecessors and the 27 6 million viewers george bush drew on the fourth night of the republican national convention in 2004 when he was nominated for a second term
9234610 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9234611 can only try to resist future temptations to abandon principle for expediency
9234612 meticulous planning will enable everything a man does to appear spontaneous
9234613 sarah palin is an extremely risky choice considering the dangerous times we find ourselves in
9234614 she is a white woman and as we all know barack obama does not even allow his white woman grandma to be interviewed so whats obamas problem with
9234615 sorry i thought it was okay to murder something so precious
9234616 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday
9234617 because you have made the lord your refuge and the most high your dwelling place

9234621 can do all things through christ who strengthens her for the task
9234622 as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them o my people those who lead you cause you to err and destroy the way of your paths
9234623 see my support for this lady as antithetical to many of
9234624 yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this
9234625 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday
9234626 because you have made the lord your refuge and the most high your dwelling place
9234627 do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward
9234628 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
9234629 for this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make special request for you asking that you may be filled with the full deep and clear knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things that you may walk live and conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him and desiring to please him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of god with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition we pray that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory to exercise every kind of endurance and patience perseverance and forbearance with joy giving thanks to the father

9234636 the month of ramadhan in which the quran was revealed is guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion between right and wrong so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadhan he must fast that month and whoever is ill or on in a state of travelling then the missed days must be made up from other days allah intends for you ease and not difficulty he wants that you complete the number of days and glorify him for having guided you and that you may be thankful to him
9234637 i heard abu hurairah may allah be pleased with him say the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam said or he said abu al qasim sallallahu alayhi wasallam said fast when you see it and break your fast when you see it and if you cannot see it then complete 30 days of shaban

9234650 a very important demographic in this election is going to be the politically independent woman 15 of whom in our latest survey are undecided
9234651 those contacts have been very injurious to us and have spoiled our attitude toward medicine and science
9234652 we are not trying to profit from or steal from brazilians
9234653 we have an obligation to respect their civilization culture and people which is why we carefully control the distribution of these cell lines
9234654 how scientists still are ill prepared for intercultural dialogue and how science behaves in an authoritarian fashion with vulnerable populations
9234655 we dont want to do something that makes a whole tribe or people unhappy or angry on the other hand the scientific community is using these samples which were accepted and maintained under perfectly legitimate procedures for the benefit of mankind
9234656 if anyone is ill we will send medicine lots of medicine
9234657 they drew blood from almost everyone including the children but once they had what they wanted we never received any medicine at all
9234658 any possible benefit of any type that results from research with this material will revert in its entirety to those who donated
9234659 they want money and we have not made any money
9234660 i dont know of anyone who has made any money from this
9234661 we dont want that blood back because it is contaminated now
9234662 but these blood samples are valuable in your technology and we think that every family that was tricked into giving blood should benefit
9234663 a soul can only be at rest after the entire body is cremated
9234664 to have the blood of a dead person preserved and separated from the remainder of the body is simply unacceptable to us
9234665 if it depended on religion and belief we would still be in the stone age

9234677 consequently you are no longer foreigners and aliens but fellow citizens with gods people and members of gods household
9234678 christs teachings are as practical today as they were when he walked in the gallilee
9234679 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose to be conformed to the image of his son
9234680 for those called by the creator according to his purpose and who love him circumstances in these persons lives will work to mold them into christ like persons

9234682 now we see through a mirror darkly a poor reflection in a poor mirror
9234683 i really hope this will be a way to expose the real danger we all are facing globally iran usa and russia hand in hand bringing the third world war
9234684 ahmadinejads mother is a jew and from the establishment of islamic republic in 1979 the crypto jews were in the highest position in decision making in the state
9234685 we couldnt carry out a better operation at the mossad than to put a guy like ahmadinejad in power in iran
9234686 proved to everyone that iran of today is an iran that is impossible to live with
9234687 i want it to be like im carrying an arm load of flowers fresh from the garden
9234688 some foreign tourists have also cut back their trips with many staying away from bangkok because of worries for their safety
9234689 if the protests end before next month then things should be okay
9234690 we are closely following the situation if the situation continues until tomorrow this will affect advance bookings in the high season and the tourism industries of phuket hat yai and krabi
9234691 i am from the uk and i flew to hong kong about a week ago and my flight was delayed 26 hours because of the typhoon
9234692 now i am on the way from singapore to phuket and it looks like i am losing yet another day of my holiday
9234693 i want to reassure the public that i will continue to carry on in my job i will not surrender i will not quit
9234694 pad members have agreed not to give up since they samaks party took power in the election they are trying to manipulate politics and interfere in the justice system
9234695 democratic women who supported hillary are sick of being regarded as a safe constituency and constantly assumed to toe the line

9234697 i guess i knew when we did the full commercial thing in the spring we would probably need something
9234698 but i didnt think we would with the mums and the corn stalks
9234699 in all honesty of course we want to be in total compliance
9234700 i am a little disappointed we have to forgo christmas
9234701 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife
9234702 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9234703 i feel comfortable in my own skin that the ship of state is on course and people are very nice to us wherever we go
9234704 he was totally insensitive to the strongly held beliefs of a lot of his colleagues not only amongst the left but also amongst the party membership amongst the trade union movement and frankly amongst the public
9234705 the last week has been all about demonstrating a couple of things
9234706 first that the liberal national parties are utterly united and capable of working together on a complex issue like this also that the coalition is in strong shape able to make a decision and stick with it that hasnt always been the case it is an important message to send to the electorate
9234707 the business community is but one of the factors the liberal party needs to take into account when it makes decisions
9234708 you only get one chance to sell a state asset and you have to meet some key tests you dont sell out consumers and you dont sell out taxpayers in the current climate we wouldnt have got an adequate return we listen to business we listen to other parts of the community
9234709 the single biggest act of economic vandalism ever witnessed in this state
9234710 less than subtle application for a job in the private sector
9234711 the fact is that michael costa finally qualifies for his parliamentary superannuation next month
9234712 there were a range of reports and industry experts that confirm that the model that was put could have secured private investment and was a road map towards the base load generation capacity that we obviously need
9234713 i support privatisation in principle and i guess i probably would have been working to bring it about in practice
9234714 from an environmental point of view with fuel prices with climate change issues with energy issues light rail is the answer
9234715 its not going to happen overnight we have a long term vision of having a light rail system for the act and its good for business
9234716 this is perfect it meets all the criteria so theres some commitment from the federal government to assist in funding
9234717 you can only put funds from a surplus into these long term infrastructure funds if there surplus remains intact
9234718 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure treasurer wayne swan would relish it too
9234719 there are some very clear facts about mr costellos track record which im sure we would be pointing out
9234720 i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duty
9234721 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9234722 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9234723 honestly put nancy and its a fair question of all the republicans is she the most qualified to be next commander in chief
9234724 well i think that she is eminently qualified to be vice president in fact senator mccains picking governor palin she has more experienced as the v p nominee than senator obama has as a presidential nominee

9234795 hello elevate unless he wanted to lose the thing he propped his arm against the wall
9234796 in an earthquake if trapped the experts advise do not light a match do not move or kick do not shout use a whistle or tap on a pipe yes one should always carry a whistle in earthquake country because you might be crushed under a building and not able to holler for help but only able to breathe lightly into your whistle or you might be buried alive under the bricks and have just enough air to toot while your voice should you have the strength to scream is absorbed into the dust and paint or you might be flung far from civilization and have two broken feet so you cant walk back and two broken arms so you cant drag yourself over the dirt but you do have this handy whistle which if you are too far to be heard or rescued can be used as solo entertainment while you wait to slowly die

9234814 hacia la identificaci n de otros entornos habitables fuera del sistema solar
9234815 estas simulaciones muestran que las estrellas j venes pueden formarse en la vecindad de los agujeros negros supermasivos siempre que exista un suministro razonable de nubes de gas desde el exterior de la galaxia
9234816 el elemento crucial fue el modelado del calentamiento y enfriamiento del gas dado que nos dec a cu nta masa es necesaria por parte del gas para tener la suficiente gravedad como para superar la propia presi n del gas y por tanto formar una estrella el calor est causado por la extrema compresi n de la nube conforme se estira y desgarra por el tir n del agujero negro esto se equilibra con el enfriamiento el cual requiere un conocimiento detallado de c mo de r pido escapa la radiaci n de la nube
9234817 las estrellas actualmente presentes alrededor del agujero negro supermasivo de la galaxia tienen tiempos de vida relativamente cortos de aproximadamente 10 millones de a os lo que sugiere que este proceso es probablemente repetitivo tal suministro continuo de estrellas en la vecindad del agujero negro y una dieta de gas acretado directamente puede ayudarnos a entender el origen de los agujeros negros en nuestra galaxia y otras del universo

9234819 la depresi n existente entre las regiones de forma poligonal constituye una especie de trampa donde se pueden acumular objetos
9234820 durante un largo espacio de tiempo puede incluso ser una regi n por donde discurra hacia el centro el material que se desprende de las zonas laterales
9234821 hemos tenido un conflicto entre stone soup y la materia blanca encontrada en la fosa denominada

9234823 este es el m s luminoso y por tanto probablemente el m s masivo c mulo de galaxias descubierto en esta poca
9234824 la luz que observamos se inici hace aproximadamente 7700 millones de a os esto es aproximadamente la mitad de la edad del universo por lo que es hace bastante tiempo y est muy lejos
9234825 la existencia del c mulo s lo puede explicarse con la energ a oscura
9234826 el hecho de encontrar estos c mulos es una clara confirmaci n de la energ a oscura
9234827 pas hace mucho tiempo y es en realidad tan masiva como las m s masivas que observamos en la actualidad sin la energ a oscura observar amos muchos m s c mulos masivos de lo que vemos en realidad

9234836 the danger of obamas charismatic healer redeemer fable lies in the hubris it encourages the belief that gifted politicians can engender a selfless communitarian solidarity
9234837 obama phrases his vision in the tranquilizing accents of oprah land his charisma is grounded in empathy rather than authority confessional candor rather than muscular strength metrosexual mildness rather than masculine testosterone
9234838 but obama mania is bound in the end to disappoint not only does it teach us to despise our political systems wise recognition of human imperfection and the pursuit of private happiness it encourages us to seek for perfection where we will not find it in politics in the hero worship of a charismatic shaman in the speciousness of a secular millennium
9234839 oh my lord i cant believe he said this here you need to read it too to know what horrible things hes saying

9234963 i am proud to join the state of texas in support of the second amendment
9234964 we need to send a strong message that law abiding citizens have a right to own firearms for personal protection for hunting and for any other lawful purpose
9234965 i heard from many alaskans serving overseas during my trip to kuwait in july
9234966 one of the most frequent questions was about the status of hunting seasons upon their return while i cant grant our troops the chance to hunt in closed areas or in places with species restrictions i do want to recognize them and help them hunt this late fall or winter when they get home
9234967 to allege that i or any member of my family requested received or released confidential personnel information on an alaska state trooper or directed disciplinary action be taken against any employee of the department of public safety is quite simply outrageous any information regarding personnel records came from the trooper himself i question the timing of these false allegations it is unfortunate as we seek to address a growing energy crisis in this state that this matter has been raised now
9234968 i do not interfere with the day to day operations of any department i have and will continue to support our line troopers they have my utmost respect since taking office i have proposed to the legislature millions of dollars in budget increases for more troopers equipment and training
9234969 as a former mayor and city council member it is my belief that services are best provided at the most local level possible

9234974 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq
9234975 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president

9235027 tom stepped on a lot of toes a lot of important toes
9235028 game wardens competed for this land too and they have connections somebody had to have some clout to have a federal agent on tom for that long
9235029 when youre a hunter whos always asked permission and made an effort to have good relations with the landowner
9235030 it stings to lose a spot youve hunted for years
9235031 vermont duck hunters as a group are very courteous and conscientious
9235032 ive been doing this for twenty eight years and i got more complaints from more people about tom than about anyone ive ever known

9235039 mccains selection of palin is opportunistic disingenuous cynical and an egregious insult to women in that it suggests women are a interchangeable b monolithic and c too unsophisticated to cast a vote based on issues
9235040 i dont know what palins policies are but shes hawt for a politician

9235056 pirate bay is the guy standing on the corner wearing a sign announcing that he can direct you to places worldwide where you can buy illegal drugs he then hands you a slip of paper called a torrent that gets you in contact with the dealers
9235057 the analogy that you comment on is good except that it is illegal to sell buy drugs
9235058 pirate bay is the guy standing on the corner wearing a sign announcing that he can direct you to places worldwide where you can buy illegal drugs

9235094 has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
9235095 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control

9235168 legislative accomplishments are few and far between because he cannot work well and bring people together and persuade them of a positive issue
9235169 its a lot closer to a revolution than to a routine day at the office
9235170 the republicans are about to nominate the only person in our party distinct enough from the rest to have a chance of winning in what ought to be a very bad year he is our most different candidate since teddy roosevelt
9235171 the overwhelming evidence that climate change is taking place argues that we address the issue
9235172 really focuses on government spending it would be a radical change for washington d c
9235173 hes taking sides in an internal republican fight between the appropriators who always want to spend more and the rest of the party i think he can win it because despite the cacophony of special interest protests hell have popular support

9235180 on an issue like partial birth abortion i strongly believe that the state can properly restrict late term abortions i have said so repeatedly all ive said is we should have a provision to protect the health of the mother and many of the bills that came before me didnt have that part of the reason they didnt have it was purposeful because those who are opposed to abortion have a moral calling to try to oppose what they think is immoral oftentimes what they were trying to do was to polarize the debate and make it more difficult for people so that they could try to bring an end to abortions overall as president my goal is to bring people together to listen to them and i dont think thats any republican out there who ive worked with who would say that i dont listen to them i dont respect their ideas i dont understand their perspective and my goal is to get us out of this polarizing debate where were always trying to score cheap political points and actually get things done
9235181 but its foolish to assume a hurricane landfall on the gulf coast would automatically disfavor the republicans
9235182 governor sarah palin is a bold choice for vice president who is a courageous advocate for unborn children in addition she is a conservative who is a reformer not afraid to shake up the establishment i congratulate senator mccain for his outstanding selection for his vice presidential running mate
9235183 it is particularly significant that a conservative woman was nominated for the nations second highest office for years the feminist movement has acknowledged for leadership only those women who embrace a radical agenda how refreshing that now we have a woman who reflects the values of mainstream american women sarah palin is pro life pro marriage and pro family she is a woman who is balancing the personal and professional in admirable ways she is an outstanding woman who will be an excellent role model for the nations young people sarah palin is chief among equals with american professional women she brings the kind of balance that characterizes the high achieving women of today she will bring to the forefront of our cultural conversations an intelligent realistic well grounded womans perspective
9235184 take that feminists here is a woman of accomplishment who brings a fresh face to traditional values and models the type of woman most girls want to become
9235185 gov palin is pro life and pro marriage she is also a lifelong member of the national rifle association
9235186 personnel is policy with the selection of gov palin sen john mccain has proven that he can exercise sound judgment gov palin has electrified conservatives
9235187 senator mccain made an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9235188 on february 11th of this year for example she signed into law the safe haven for infants act facilitating the safe surrender of an unwanted newborn to a place of safety and hope her actions contrast sharply with the democratic nominee senator barack obama d ill who when he was in the illinois senate repeatedly helped to kill a bill that sought to protect babies who survived abortion
9235189 teach both evolution and creationism you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides
9235190 a pastor a priest a rabbi certainly they have the freedom to say whatever they want to say and you know thank the lord that we do have that freedom of speech
9235191 faith is very important to so many of us here in america and i would never support any government effort to stifle our freedom of religion or freedom of expression or freedom of speech
9235192 you know i would just caution maybe a pastor to be very careful if theyre in front of a congregation and they decide to endorse one candidate over another
9235193 but no ill tell you freedom of speech is so precious and its worth defending and of course freedom of religion and freedom of expression will be things that i will fight for
9235194 sarah palin will be a great vice president because she believes in x
9235195 she is insightful smart comes up with creative solutions is good working with legislatures diplomats
9235196 well she just got that job because shes a woman
9235197 throwing starts from the feet jumping starts from the arms
9235198 god showed how much he loved us by sending his one and only son into the world so that we might have eternal life through him this is real love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son as a sacrifice to take away our sins everyone who believes that jesus is the christ has become a child of god
9235199 our goal is to reach every corner of this state and every georgian with our movement for change

9235211 i learned how to play through adversity how to play hurt how to rehab i learned a lot of things i wouldnt call it a total loss
9235212 i think missing the playoffs makes everyone hungrier you can just see how many guys are here what are we three or four weeks to camp but weve got 10 11 12 guys here everyone just seems to be recharged this year and hungrier and ready to go i think were going to have a lot more fire to our game

9235231 zeitgeist produced by peter joseph was created as a nonprofit filmiac expression to inspire people to start looking at the world from a more critical perspective and to understand that very often things are not what the population at large think they are it is my hope that people will not take what is said in the film as the truth but find out for themselves for truth is not told it is realized
9235232 the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others
9235233 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a

9235235 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9235236 republicans rightfully have criticized the democratic nominee for his lack of experience but palin is a neophyte in comparison
9235237 governor palins lack of experience especially in national security and foreign affairs raises immediate questions about how prepared she is to potentially succeed to the presidency
9235238 has not only succeeded in unifying our party but also in generating great enthusiasm

9235258 most bookstores buy stock for 20 to 40 percent off suggested retail
9235259 but they can buy remainders and other bargain books for as much as 90 percent off retail price that means they can sell the books for less in a time when consumers are spending fewer dollars on books and still make a higher profit margin

9235264 they were being pushed off to one side and this big bank was coming in and being the seller
9235265 the lenders seem not prepared to act in a timely resolved and professional fashion on a short sale
9235266 they just dont get it that they have to get rid of this property that every day they have it costs them more money they are overloaded overburdened confused unable to deal
9235267 eleven years ago when i got my license we were in a market similar to now and short sales were more common
9235268 banks would preapprove them now its been so long that weve had such a good market banks are not set up to deal with them the longer were in this soft market banks will realize they have to step up to the plate
9235269 lenders and mortgage servicers consider short sales a necessary evil but it obviously involves a loss for them
9235270 we want to make sure the person isnt selling to someone they know
9235271 you have to watch to make sure the seller isnt cutting their brother in law a deal
9235272 if the bank has already incurred most of the expenses and is ready to foreclose anyway it will say were not going to save anything here with a short sale
9235273 as a buyer i think you can get a fair price going with the asking price

9235323 we did the job and we were loading the patient in the back of the ambulance when we heard a cat let out a big meow
9235324 someone said there was a cat on the roof and i looked up and was very surprised to see it was my cat chloe
9235325 the road to oak beach is quite windy and it was lights and sirens all the way
9235326 when i took her down she was all fluffed up and her eyes were a bit blown out and she did a big help get me off meow
9235327 everyone had a good laugh and even the little girl who was very sick found it funny
9235328 i think she has used all nine lives in 24 hours
9235329 the following night she was walking funny and was quite sick so we took her to the vet
9235330 she is all right now but its been a big 24 hours for her
9235331 that came as a stark reality that i hadnt expected we couldnt allow that to happen
9235332 im a strong believer i think she must have had a guardian angel im so happy
9235333 i couldnt believe it but when i got down there i knew it was my cat because they all have their own voice
9235334 hes black and white and looks just like a whale we named him shamu
9235335 he looks to be in pretty good shape other than him being grossly obese
9235336 when you look down at the cat you cant even see his feet
9235337 weve just been looking out for the best interests of the cat
9235338 i just hope its not a trend thats starting because we dont have cages big enough to accommodate these fat cats

9235340 unfortunately cats who land in shelters without an id are unlikely to be recovered

9235373 in astrology a planets domicile or less commonly house not to be confused with the astrological house system is the zodiac sign over which it has rulership it is important to note that this is a separate concept from the houses of the horoscope a planetary ruler is given to each sign over which the planet is said to have a more powerful influence when positioned therein a planet is considered to be in domal dignity when it is positioned in the sign it rules
9235374 many modern astrologers assign what is called a natural rulership of each house of the horoscope to a different planet in the same way as the zodiac signs are said to have rulers
9235375 when a person attempts to determine the rulership of a house the more planets or bodies that rule that house will reveal its complexity generally the sign on the cusp will be the outward representation of the rulership but the ruler of the sign inside the house will not be readily apparent but will manifest itself at critical points in a persons life
9235376 as in the case of intercepted houses the sign that is in the middle of the house is the sign that the native must transcend before he can progress to the next phase of the houses rulership therefore as in the previous example if a house is intercepted with the sign of scorpio then the native must will be initially presented with many libran qualities but must work through those very intense issues of sex death and regeneration before he will be able to enjoy the benefits of jupiter which will be the last and ultimate state the native must work through before he has fully experienced all of the aspects of that house
9235377 a dispositor is a delineation of planetary rulership in relation to the signs for instance if mercury is in libra its dispositor is venus if venus is in turn in sagittarius its dispositor is jupiter and if jupiter is cancer its dispositor is the moon this process continues until there is a final dispositor sign in its own rulership or it circles around in a never ending chain of command
9235378 classical astrologers whose methods are rooted in traditional methods do not use any of the outer planets not recognized by the ancients as the rulers of any of the 12 signs preferring the traditional rulership scheme
9235379 on the other hand most modern psychologically oriented astrologers do use the outer planets as ruling planets of those particular three signs listed above many others also use the ancient rulers while using the modern planets as the co ruler of those signs
9235380 other astrologers do not use any of the planets as sign rulers cosmobiologists uranian astrologers hamburg school of astrology other groups individuals preferring to focus more on the astrological aspects and other portions of the horoscope instead

9235492 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9235493 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9235494 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9235495 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9235496 if she had been around for two terms as governor or been a senator it would have been an incredible choice

9235519 it came to a head because he missed the meeting yesterday
9235520 i guess the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team in my opinion and i know in the rest of the leadership groups opinion you need to be committed 100 percent thats all facets of being an international cricketer
9235521 we believe for the best interests of this team for the best interests of andrew symonds is for him to have time away from the game and lets try and get him right as soon as possible to get him back in our team
9235522 andrew was obviously very disappointed he accepts our decision i hope he goes away from this and gets himself right and gets himself back into our team because he is a very important player and we want him as a part of our squad
9235523 theres got to be consistency in the group and youve got to stand for something you cant have players doing that sort of stuff
9235524 hes got to have a good look at what hes doing for sure hes got to re assess where hes at if hes doing these things its not the first time
9235525 i havent spoken to andrew in detail so its very hard for me to defend him
9235526 the statement this morning mentioned that cricket australia was concerned about andrews well being
9235527 i dont think that sounds like a case of his contract being torn up
9235528 its a decision thats been made by the senior player group theyre concerned about his well being thats my understanding
9235529 the concern is to work with andrew to ensure that we get him back in harness for the next 12 months
9235530 michaels clarke concern is that he is as fully committed to playing international cricket as he needs his players to be

9235534 i want to thank defenders of wildlife action fund supporters for their help in this hard fought campaign
9235535 we faced an approximately 750 000 campaign from our opponents including safari club international and a 400 000 state funded campaign approved by governor sarah palin and the alaska legislature
9235536 but thanks to the generous support of defenders of wildlife action fund activists and donors we were able to reach thousands of voters yesterday over 75 000 alaskans voted to end this barbaric practice
9235537 despite this loss were not giving up alaskans for wildlife will continue to hold the state board of games feet to the fire and redouble our efforts to end this brutal program
9235538 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9235539 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9235540 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil

9235556 the divine conspiracy christianity todays book of the year in 1998
9235557 if you stay in the churches the university will be closed to you but if you stay in the university the churches will be open to you
9235558 jesus and his teachings and the philosophers and their teachings were addressing the same questions
9235559 generally what i find is that the ordinary people who come to church are basically running their lives on their own utilizing the arm of the flesh their natural abilities to negotiate their own way
9235560 they believe there is a god and they need to check in with him but they dont have any sense that he is an active agent in their lives as a result they dont become disciples of jesus
9235561 they consume his merits and the services of the church discipleship is no essential part of christianity today
9235562 we dont preach life in the kingdom of god through faith in jesus as an existential reality that leads to discipleship and then character transformation

9235595 to believe that he will preserve us is indeed a means of preservation god will certainly preserve us and make a way of escape for us out of the temptation should we fall we are to pray for what god has already promised our requests are to be regulated by his promises and commands faith embraces the promises and so finds relief

9235600 for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard
9235601 and going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and to them he said you go into the vineyard too and whatever is right i will give you
9235602 that which is right conformable to right pertaining to right that which is just which is expected by the one who sets the rules and regulations whereby man must live whether that be society or god
9235603 and when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman call the laborers and pay them their wages beginning with the last up to the first and when those hired about the eleventh hour came each of them received a denarius now when those hired first came they thought they would receive more but each of them also received a denarius and on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house saying these last worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat but he replied to one of them friend i am doing you no wrong did you not agree with me for a denarius take what belongs to you and go i choose to give to this last worker as i give to you am i not allowed to do what i choose with what belongs to me or do you begrudge my generosity so the last will be first and the first last
9235604 and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a penny
9235605 and the ones coming the eleventh hour each received a denarious penny
9235606 see we have left everything and followed you what then will we have

9235901 these protests are led by a man who has been convicted by the suva magistrates court for causing the death of a person mr chaudhry himself was convicted sometime back for manslaughter and he was released from prison only three days after serving his sentence on a cso compulsory supervision order
9235902 the same feeble excuse was used by the late ratu sir kamisese mara after sitiveni rabuka removed dr timoci bavadras labour coalition in 1987
9235903 it would be in the best interest of mr bainimarama to get us out of the economic decline rather than stick his nose in the affairs of the methodist church
9235904 it would be best for him to tell archbishop mataca to refrain from getting involved and hoodwinking on the charter
9235905 they are trying to hang on to the last straw as we make in roads into giving a real voice and say to ordinary people in the country
9235906 naturally there are some power hungry nationalist sdl leaders and followers supported by the leadership of the methodist church and some chiefs who do not want ordinary people to be empowered in terms of decision making and aspiring for better things in life
9235907 they want to continue to remain in power and in the process ensure that the common people remain disenfranchised
9235908 when they chiefs went to make the presentation they went as direct descendants of those who accepted christianity in fiji
9235909 that gesture was a sign of reconfirming the bond between the vanua and the church
9235910 what they were able to do was in their traditional role to tell the church that their support was still there has never wavered or changed and it has remained solid as ever
9235911 the sdl has never tried to interfere in the affairs of the church the sdl has its own credible people and the church has its own
9235912 the church leaders are very professional people and do not need political parties that statement is disrespectful as far as the commander is concerned
9235913 if he says it is our last straw then he should call the election tomorrow
9235914 the charter is unconstitutional and does not reflect good governance fairness and transparency we will only support what is legal and constitutional
9235915 we have always stated from the beginning that the sdl is not out to get political mileage but to show that we are upholding the constitution

9236135 the eu27 population is also projected to continue to grow older with the share of the population aged 65 years and over rising from
9236136 in consequence the old age dependency ratio in the eu27 i e the population aged 65 years and older divided by the working age population is projected to increase from 25 in 2008 to 53 in 2060 in other words there would be only two persons of working age for every person aged 65 or more in 2060 compared with four persons to one today

9236138 ive had the opportunity to work side by side with dirk for almost a decade
9236139 he has a wealth of cycling knowledge and experience and also has the ability to recognize young talent our directors have done an excellent job this season and adding dirk will only make us better in 2009
9236140 on the run in to the finish it was really fast just attacks everywhere
9236141 on the last corner i hit a bit of gravel and had to swing wide which put me into eighth spot i did a bit of a surge to get to the front and they all swung right so i took my opportunity and hit them quite early it was a good 400 meter sprint you get the feeling when there is no one around you the win was there
9236142 the only way we were going to be able to get rid of him was to make it really hard so we made it really hard
9236143 as soon as we realized that cavendish wasnt there i spoke with julian dean and matt wilson and agreed to stick it to columbia
9236144 a guy from our team adam semple and a guy from type 1 really drove it
9236145 any sort of tactics is going to go out the window
9236146 only the guys with the strong legs will be there
9236147 it was a nice victory for the whole team particularly since i am leaving at the end of the season they were nice enough to let me have it
9236148 bennati did a great job in the final half of the course we were a little behind in the split but we really poured it on in the second half of the course were all ecstatic to win
9236149 maybe i can do something tomorrow into ja n its a bumpy stage with a hilltop finish ideal for my characterstics
9236150 obviously the big objective is the worlds thats why i am here at the vuelta
9236151 the differences are minimal and you cant put too much importance into it we all went for it but didnt want to take unnecessary risks in the corners the most important thing wasnt to fall
9236152 it was a great way to start the vuelta we gave our all and thats what we wanted to do the first sensations are good
9236153 the course was very technical and to be honest my team rode really well i am leaving content because the test has been good
9236154 if the fans have been with us in the bad moments and now that were winning everywhere its logical that they feel connected with us for me its an immense pleasure to see and feel the love of the public
9236155 maybe its not bad for me that everyone is looking at the others
9236156 im not sure i am on that level yet but i hope to be in contention for the podium that would be a good goal in my professional progression and to win a mountain stage the angliru of course
9236157 id love to finish on the final podium i think i am capable of doign well in three weeks and id love to win another stage every climber dreams of winning on the angliru

9236160 im not sure if i ever had coaching qualities as a player i just feel like you are who you are
9236161 i went out and played the best i could every night and tried to learn all the time in every situation i was pretty fortunate to play as long as i did and learn from all the great people and i look forward to passing some of that along in this new role
9236162 ive definitely thought for a while now that i wanted to stay in the game in some way once i retired
9236163 i had some conversations that something like this might be a possibility once last season ended and i took some time this summer to mull it over the stars organization is a class act all the way and i have the utmost respect for dave tippett rick wilson and mark lamb so ill be really fortunate to learn the ropes from them

9236166 it might make sense to go to 17 and three as a first step and see how that works
9236167 the fans certainly love regular season action the only downside is if you have a team that is 2 13 or 5 11 and you have to play those last couple of games
9236168 are those games worse than the fourth preseason game probably not if you have superstars coming to town from the other team and theyre going to play
9236169 there is going to be lots of dialogue on a whole lot of issues and this will be one i would imagine the players might have different opinions on it as well

9236212 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9236213 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9236214 and it is warm not something im really used to
9236215 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9236228 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9236229 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working

9236261 nerazzurri adalah favorit tapi mereka harus waspada terhadap juventus dan ac milan yang berlaga di piala uefa yang berarti kedua tim ini akan habis habisan merebut scudetto
9236262 saya juga penasaran dengan fiorentina saya kira mereka bisa membahayakan mereka adalah tim yang dipenuhi pemain muda meski gilardino dan mutu sudah tidak masuk kategori itu lagi roma juga akan kompetitif hingga akhir kompetisi
9236263 kami bahagia dapat mengumumkan bahwa kami telah mencapai kesepakatan dengan spartak moskow untuk mentransfer roman pavlyuchenko ke klub
9236264 objektif kami hanya memenangi scudetto semua orang harus tahu itu kami tidak suka menyelesaikan kompetisi di urutan kedua tekanan ada pada saya saya siap memikulnya jujur saya malah sudah tidak sabar ingin segera memulai

9236330 ane ingin ngumpulin salafiyun trus tak sembelih satu satu biar kapok
9236331 dan barangsiapa yang membunuh seorang mukmin dengan sengaja maka balasannya ialah jahannam kekal ia di dalamnya dan allah murka kepadanya dan mengutukinya serta menyediakan adzab yang besar baginya
9236332 ketika nabi pernah mengatakan kurang lebih begini jika kau di pukul bagian tubuhmu balas lah dengan memukul di bagian yg sama fair dan ketika ane temukan jasad pem fitnah ini yg memfitnah ane dan meresahkan keluarga ane hmmm urusannya sama sangkur poso
9236333 saya itu yakin bahwa pemahaman para pengikut syaikh rabi bin hadi dan syaikh muqbil bin hadi itu
9236334 metode yang mereka pakai adalah googling mencari informasi dengan search engine google ini bukan perbuatan orang muslim tetapi kaum yahudi
9236335 saya percaya apa pun kata hadis anda tentang perilaku sex muhamad tetap anda anggap muhamad itu adalah orang yang mulia dan beraklak baik itu terserah anda
9236336 selama puasa superman sex suka cium dan jilat lidah aisha he he
9236337 muhamad sekali lagi main sex dengan aisha yang lagi menses
9236338 penikahan itu adalah kudus dan sex itu pun adalah kudus jika dilakukan dengan benar tapi oleh kelakukan muhamad menjadikan sex bagi dirinya sebagai kebejatan buat dirinya sendiri bagaimana mungkin nabi terakhir mengambil istri orang lain anak kecil 9 thn disetubuhi ngajarin sex pakai tangan ngurusin cara membersihkan sperma suka berfantasi sex ketika lihat wanita lalu ngak tahan lagi langsung nyalurin ke istrinya suka sex bareng dgn banyak2 istrinya lah ini kan adengan film bf jangan jangan film bf itu berisnpirasi dari kisah muhamad itu gambar 3a cercaan dari prayoto myqers pro aktif yang hingga tanggal 8 agustus 2008 pukul 10 45 ya allah ya rahman ya rahim sungguh engkau menjadi sebaik baik saksi atas kebencian orang orang kafir itu terhadap rasulmu shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan sungguh engkaupun menjadi sebaik baik saksi bahwa myquran menjadi corong corong manusia terlaknat tersebut dalam menghinakan nabimu
9236339 eh alquran yang asli itu sudah dibakar usman cs alquran yang elo pegang itu adalah salinan ke 2 sudah banyak bukti alquran itu kitab sesat yang nyontek dari apocripa palsu dan banyak kontradiksi di dalamnya secara extenal pun alquran itu banyak bohongnya dan kisah alquran punyak bertentangan dgn sejarah dan alkitab kalau dibahas bisa panjang lebar bung
9236340 azab dan neraka bagi orang yang ingar dan mendustai alquran
9236341 di alkitab jelas menyatakan bahwa yesus itu adalah penyelamat dan penolong manusia masakan tuhan ente mau mengutus nabi terakhir setelah isa tapi tuh orang bukan penolong dan penyelamat manusia jika itu terjadi kemungkinan ada 2 1 tuhan ente lagi linglung 2 muhamad nabi palsu percaya ame gue deh ngak akan lari dari 2 kemungkinan itu lah
9236342 semoga anda semakin yakin bahwa alquran adalah wahyu setan yang sengaja menyesatkan manusia dari kebenaran alkitab
9236343 diantara manusia ada orang yang membantah tentang allah tanpa ilmu pengetahuan dan mengikuti setiap syaithan yang jahat yang telah ditetapkan terhadap syaithan itu bahwa barangsiapa yang berkawan dengan dia tentu dia akan menyesatkannya dan membawanya ke adzab neraka
9236344 alquran bilang isa bukan hanya utusan tapi sebagai allah god juga
9236345 tapi muhamad malah mati diracun oleh orang yahudi kemudia mati dikuburkan dan tidak bangkit dari kematian
9236346 jika minum khamar adalah perbuatan setan dan allah swt memberi minum khamar di surga islam maka jelas
9236347 tuhan islam itu bisa melakukan perbuatan setan makara atau tipu daya adalah perbuatan iblis yang juga dilakukan oleh allah swt
9236348 he he he he sudah pada frustasi tidak bisa mengelak fakta pengetahuan muhamad itu dari iblis lalu bikin pertanyaan yang bodoh dan fitnah tentang an nisa 11 12
9236349 tuhannya muhammad awloh dlm quran yang begitu gila penyembahan adalah bukan tuhan yang sama dengan tuhan para nabi tuhannya muhammad adalah tuhan lain yang tidak ada hubungannya dengan para nabi justru kalau kita mencocokkannya dengan bibel tuhannya muhammad identik dengan setan
9236350 kita tahu bahwa sosok yang mula mula menyesatkan manusia adam adalah setan kemudian awloh mengaku dengan terus terang bahwa dirinya suka menyesatkan manusia dan raja tipu yang lihai
9236351 hanya tuhan sinting saja yg minta dirinya disembah sembah 50 kali sehari
9236352 saya bukan kristen kalau saya disuruh memilih nabi mana yang layak diikuti saya pilih yesus sekalipun yesus bukan tuhan dan bila seandainya allah swt itu tuhan saya lebih memilih tidak ber tuhan daripada bertuhankan sosok jelek seperti allah swt
9236353 saya percaya kalau semua umat beragama bisa hidup rukun bersama yaitu apabila ajaran ajarannya tidak seperti ajaran arab ajaran muhammad itu sangat berbahaya masa dia mengajari kita agar membunuh orang orang di sekeliling kita dia pun juga mencita citakan arab suatu hari nanti bakal menguasai seluruh dunia telaah kritis mana mesti kita ikuti yesus atau muhammad
9236354 kita ikut muhammad sama dengan ikut setan kita ikut yesus sama dengan ikut tuhan
9236355 tetapi muhammad mengajari kita agar memusuhi manusia lain seharusnya kita sadar kalau muhammad adalah alat setan dialah anti kristus
9236356 yesus tidak pernah mengajari kita agar memusuhi muhammad mengajari kita agar memusuhi
9236357 iya kok memang islam telah memfitnah tapi kalau yang berikut ini bukanlah fitnah 1
9236358 to baidowi kalau muslim murtad apa agama yg anda rekomendasikan
9236359 saya nyatakan islam itu jelek karena pendirinya jelek sebaliknya kristen itu baik karena pendirinya baik ini fakta lho
9236360 dan pada hari kiamat kamu akan melihat orang orang yang berbuat dusta terhadap allah mukanya menjadi hitam bukankah dalam neraka jahannam itu ada tempat bagi orang orang yang menyombongkan diri
9236361 sesungguhnya orang orang yang mernyakiti alah dan rasulnya allah akan melaknatinya di dunia dan di akhirat dan menyediakan baginya siksa yang menghinakan
9236362 jadi keluarlah dari islam dan anutlah agama sah yang sudah ditetapkan pemerintah asal jangan balik lagi ke agama bikinan arab itu
9236363 tujuan utama saya di sini bukan mengajak muslim masuk kristen tapi agar mereka keluar dari islam setelah keluar terserah mereka mau pilih agama apa
9236364 mereka tidak henti hentinya memerangi kamu sampai mereka dapat mengembalikan kamu dari agamamu kepada kekafiran seandainya mereka sanggup barangsiapa yang murtad diantara kamu dari agamanya lalu dia mati dalam kekafiran maka mereka itulah yang sia sia amalannya di dunia dan di akhirat dan mereka itulah penghuni neraka mereka kekal di dalamnya
9236365 mereka ingin supaya kamu menjadi kafir sebagaimana mereka telah menjadi kafir lalu kamu menjadisama dengan mereka maka janganlah kamu jadikan diantara mereka penolong penolong mu hingga mereka berhijrah pada jalan allah

9236374 karena sesungguhnya kalau kamu berbuat demikian tentulah kamu serupa dengan mereka sesungguhnya allah akan mengumpulkan semua orang orang munafik dan orang orang kafir di dalam jahannam

9236403 if you want to walk on water you got to get out of the boat
9236404 the important message is the belief in us that we can raise student achievement and that he has empowered us at our schools
9236405 he made people comfortable and he recognized them which is the first time ive seen a superintendent do that
9236406 child abuse is going to be front and center in terms of your training and your development
9236407 all of this supports the bottom line which is student achievement
9236408 im totally for getting behind grass roots reform but whats the reform and how is it going to work
9236409 it felt like to me it wasnt a partnership it was a takeover
9236410 frankly our job was to make sure people know what this was about we expected people to leave
9236411 the thing about the partnership is its an unknown theres no track record
9236412 even though its called a partnership how can you call it a partnership and exclude the administrators
9236413 i didnt want to leave i was open from the beginning to the transformation
9236414 sure i made the decision to leave but what else am i going to do
9236415 you have to have a good working relationship with your supervisor
9236416 what is important in school reform is that leadership is in sync with one another from the superintendent to the principals to the teachers
9236417 as long as senior management and the principals are in sync you have a much better chance for real change to benefit students thats the bottom line
9236418 what were trying to create is a completely new model and yes the role of administrators is different because they no longer make the ultimate decision
9236419 we dont want teachers who are not going to buy into this to be forced into anything
9236420 i cant imagine any organization that would just give itself over to the employees and say go do it
9236421 this is my 18th year in education and will be one of the more exciting years in my career
9236422 i think the concern ought to be are people ready to take over leadership roles at those institutions
9236423 its not just an issue of if theyre new its about what experience they have
9236424 schools are strong institutions that are almost impossible to mess up
9236425 in the month leading up to her leaving she was involved
9236426 theres a fundamental shift in the way decisions are made im not going to speculate if that was a direction she did not want to be under
9236427 the transition team is seeing this as an opportunity to re envision what characteristics the school leader would have
9236428 its a great thing for all the schools it makes some of the reform stuff real for people
9236429 just that has a significant effect heres the different way that things are happening
9236430 while leadership is important it is by no means the end game of the change were looking for were looking for outcomes
9236431 well continue to have some of these issues that crop up from time to time and the only thing we can do is be prepared for knowing well occasionally encounter errors and fix them quickly
9236432 im just waiting for the first week of school and for the phone to ring

9236455 i think mccains decision to announce the vp pick tomorrow may be too clever by half i mean it will certainly draw some attention but its not like the press will completely ignore obamas speech tomorrow or over the weekend in this sense announcing tomorrow will prevent mccain from getting maximum coverage of his vp selection

9236480 there are whole albums credited to jennifer aniston who is a very nice girl i dated for about a week i dont myself remember writing a song about her
9236481 had i known i was making history i would have been a better boyfriend
9236482 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
9236483 after it i leaned back and i said you cheated and he said why and i said i dont kiss on the first date then he said well i never really play by the rules
9236484 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date
9236485 have a boyfriend right now i go on dates and have crushes and stuff though
9236486 he had great respect from the players he brought veteran leadership and experience
9236487 he played well and it came down to whenever you look at those safety spots it comes down to special teams and we thought nate salley and quinton teal both did a good job on special teams and they are two good players for us
9236488 that obviously will be one of those spots we look at
9236489 we have to see how d j hackett is and monitor ryne robinson as we go
9236490 but obviously with steve smith suspended were thin there hopefully we can get d j back its a position we have been nicked at throughout the preseason and well have to see how it goes the next three or four days
9236491 we think mackenzy is going to be a very good player he improved the entire training camp and we thought he played well the last preseason game against the steelers he has good size and movement
9236492 it was a difficult decision to let milford brown go because he came in and did everything we asked of him and played well but we could only keep so many numbers there and we kept nine we let milford go and that was a very hard decision
9236493 the timing wasnt very good but we had difficult decisions there and it came down we had some guys there that we know that we had here last year and we made the decision to keep them
9236494 labrandon and decori came in and showed some things but it was a numbers situation four is as many as we could carry in the makeup of our roster right now

9236510 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9236511 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

9236515 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9236516 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono

9236546 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9236547 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9236551 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9236552 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9236553 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9236554 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9236555 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9236556 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9236557 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9236558 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9236559 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9236560 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

9236562 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9236563 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9236564 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9236565 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9236566 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9236567 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9236568 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9236569 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9236570 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9236571 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9236572 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9236573 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9236574 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9236575 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9236576 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9236577 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9236578 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9236579 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9236580 these three false expectations all have one thing in common they all assume that buildings can meet non building needs
9236581 she has trauma to her upper torso it appears to be a homicide
9236582 usually this area is pretty safe and we dont have much happening around here
9236583 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9236584 ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming
9236585 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9236586 in fact there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future the possible listing of a healthy species like the polar bear would be based on uncertain modeling of possible effects the center for biological diversity which petitioned for the polar bear to be protected wants the listing to force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces or even allows the production of greenhouse gases such limits should be adopted through an open process in which environmental issues are weighed against economic and social needs and where scientists debate and present information that policy makers need to make the best decisions americans should become involved in the issue of climate change by offering suggestions for constructive action to their state governments but listing the polar bear as threatened is the wrong way to get to the right answer
9236587 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
9236588 completely ridiculous and a waste of the courts time this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
9236589 conserving energy and using it more efficiently doesn t necessarily mean you have to sacrifice your quality of life
9236590 its the little things like making sure lights computers and appliances are turned off
9236591 ignoring the problem reflects a liberal live for today attitude unworthy of our great country
9236592 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9236593 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9236594 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9236595 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9236596 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9236597 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari

9236599 i couldnt have sex with you because of the pressure
9236600 failed to address in light of the allegations made by binyam mohamed the abhorrence and condemnation accorded to torture cruel inhuman or degrading treatment
9236601 confirmed the concern i have had for several years that the uk is complicit in extraordinary rendition
9236602 mimi you have no idea how hard this for me
9236603 well to look at you no one would ever know it
9236604 a m me han asaltado dos veces fue hace cuatro a os y con violencia cortaron cartucho
9236605 hay gente de todos los estratos sociales desde adultos hasta ni os pues al final del d a lo que todos esperamos es que ning n crimen quede sin castigo
9236606 si bien el gobierno tiene la principal responsabilidad de garantizar la seguridad es la ciudadan a la que tiene que tomar su papel en t rminos de denunciar para que las autoridades tomen acciones
9236607 whatever befalls the earth befalls the people on the earth man did not weave the web of life he is merely a strand in it whatever he does to the web he does to himself
9236608 insist there is no targeted operation against militants rather it is a haphazard armed invasion on the people of swat
9236609 they have given numerous examples where militants could have been apprehended or attacks on civilians could have been averted had the security forces acted with diligence
9236610 but the olympic athletes they are real role models this is the america we like to see
9236611 shes shown a woman can run companies can lead philanthropic organizations can do really anything
9236612 the patrons were brawling towards the end of the night and it involved separate groups including a wedding party and various other parties including birthday guests
9236613 a chap was stabbed in the leg and immediately taken to hospital
9236614 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9236615 it looks like theyre incredibly well prepared much better than they had before
9236616 odds are its a boy but well be happy with either sex
9236617 were just hoping for a healthy baby but theres a chance for a boy odds are positive
9236618 it would have been nice to do it on our terms
9236619 we were hoping to be a little further along before news got out
9236620 savage and the coaches could not look past his size and speed
9236621 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9236622 but ive had over a week to think about it
9236623 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9236624 trying different kinds of shots too trying to add some variety
9236625 if i get a chance i definitely do try to come in especially a lot more this year
9236626 i like it at the net i just try to play the ball if its short i move in if i have a chance i move in
9236627 im thinking about moving forward in every match thats my mentality
9236628 but as it moves into a less favorable environment in the north central gulf of mexico where the water temperatures are cooler it could encounter wind shear
9236629 we could get some rain bands out of it and theres the possibility of tropical force winds depending on where it is
9236630 he sounds terrific but i dont know whats really there
9236631 i think that this election will be a much more interesting one and a much closer one than some people have assumed up till now
9236632 but once it gets into a headline then it can become the law but you have to ride over that
9236633 when some of the media criticises and says that were not well known and so on you have to say why
9236634 shes a charming articulate and highly motivated lady and she will do an outstanding job for the country
9236635 the fact that she is a woman i think is an added bonus but im never one to put much on the issue of men or women i think its the best person for the job
9236636 to have our first female governor general is going to be a wonderful thing for the country
9236637 what ive tried to say over many years now is that we should never be frightened of looking at better ways of governing ourselves
9236638 now this is not talking about a republic or a constitutional monarchy or anything like that its about better ways of governing ourselves right through the whole spectrum
9236639 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
9236640 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
9236641 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9236642 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9236643 we didnt really talk much about the wooden spoon you come off earning the respect of your teammate
9236644 it wasnt about us getting off the bottom tonight it was about having the respect for each other
9236645 we felt the forwards we put out tonight were as good a pack the club has got
9236646 we expected a dominant performance like that and the forwards were outstanding
9236647 i thought luke odonnell on the edge was very dominant with some big hits and that was pretty much across the board so that was very pleasing
9236648 it gives us a little bit of confidence and something to look forward to next year but we want to focus on hopefully getting a win at shark park
9236649 we turned over too much possession and i have to put my hand up there too
9236650 oh look willows turned randomly evil for no reason and tara is laying on the ground she must be sleeping
9236651 the player shot his rival from just two metres despite seeing that he was not wearing any kind of protective mask
9236652 women are speaking highly of themselves and that causes men who sacrifice their lives for this sport disappointment women are not champions in this sport they are only participants if they observed regulations more they would not have such problems
9236653 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9236654 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9236655 the highest science the loftiest speculation the mightiest philosophy which can ever engage the attention of a child of god is the name the nature the person the work the doings and the existence of the great god whom he calls father
9236656 we can understand some of truth of the trinity by summarizing the teaching of scripture in three statements 1 god is three persons each person is fully god there is one god
9236657 great is the lord and most worthy of praise his greatness no one can fathom
9236658 for there is one god and there is one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
9236659 god does welcome us but only through the son apart from the son we are denied all access to a holy and righteous god the holy spirit is often times the overlooked person of the trinity in the evangelical world however the holy spirit is a central person of the godhead in pauls letter to the philippians he wrote
9236660 but some christians have so minimized the spirits role in worship that hes functionally irrelevant like a persons appendix its there but were not sure why
9236661 the governor obviously has a penchant for television shows of paranormal female empowerment
9236662 maybe its a bogus rumor but buffy fans will dig it

9236666 this iphone didnt make it a week before it was dropped on a tile floor shattering the protective glass and the case since the accident i can get the phone to power up only sporadically and only with some prodding when i can get the phone to turn on 50 of the time all areas of the touch screen seem to work permitting normal operation i cannot vouch for the phone sending receving any data though and i have not tested any calling functions
9236667 i dropped my iphone only a couple weeks after i bought it and the glass cracked the lcd is in perfect condtion the phone still works like new including all the touch motion functionality its as if nothing had ever happened
9236668 the iphone will not turn on it hasnt turned on for about two weeks the iphone does not show any signs of water damage nothing happens when it is plugged into the computer or the wall
9236669 broken iphone 3g needs a glass screen replaced but in working condition you can buy the sccreen on ebay for 20 or have apple fix it for 199 if anything else is wrong apple will fix and should be covered under warranty for up to one year i dont need it anymore i have another phone
9236670 no reserve broken water damaged iphone 3g 16 gigabyte model dropped in water inner lcd is cracked i cracked it when i was putting it back together i opened it to allow the phone to dry thoroughly for a week the phone turns on battery charges and it pretty much still functional minus the earpiece speaker no sound the home button does not work consistently as well when turned on now it asks for a sim card to be inserted and ready to activate
9236671 found this phone in a river jumped in after it cleaned it dried it out and now it actually turns on still in really good shape no dents or scratches i computer will recognize it and when plugged into an outlet the connect to itunes screen comes on clearly the only problem is that when i plug it into itunes it says that an unknown error occurred 1601 im not very tech saavy so i dont know how to get past this point which is why im selling it it still is possible for this phone to work i just dont know what to do to fix it and apple wont hel me ill take it for any price

9236678 the big campaign of the summer has been respect and barton showed little of it there
9236679 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i saw which is what i was upset about
9236680 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card
9236681 it wasnt a reckless tackle it was a good tackle
9236682 i was not surprised by the reaction of the fans i have been involved in the game long enough not to be surprised by anything
9236683 nasri clipped barton and there was a little incident between them but he was booked and rightly so

9236694 why on earth would a premier league club be interested in him now after one performance
9236695 if he was going to be desirable to anyone then they have had 10 weeks over the summer to get him
9236696 i was not upset everyone can see the game and say what they think i respect the opinions of all the managers
9236697 usually you would not speak about the national team manager
9236698 you get the feeling that the sooner the whole thing is finished the better
9236699 the chapter finally closes with the end of the transfer market i think there is going to be lots of reasonably furious action between now and then
9236700 without a doubt it has had an awful lot to do with the start to the season
9236701 with the comings and goings players are obviously trying their best to concentrate 100 percent but i think it has affected things slightly with their work on the training ground and even going into games it has been affected by this
9236702 it would have been great to have been a lot calmer but you have to grin and bear it and get on with things
9236703 certainly the ideal situation is that you get your squad settled early you work with all the players in the pre season period

9236724 it was so tough for me to get a rhythm but i felt after the third set the momentum was with me
9236725 my fitness is something ive worked so hard on ive got a great team with me and im really enjoying working with them
9236726 ideally youd rather not play matches of that length but sometimes it happens youve got to get through it
9236727 i am starting to play better today i served very well
9236728 they arsenal are an excellent side and they played very very well today
9236729 i just said to my players we need the kind of breaks they got to get something here today we needed the penalty which basically was a load of nonsense
9236730 im not denying it hit his arm but when youre two and a half yards away and someone hits the ball its very difficult to get out of the way i think its harsh
9236731 they played very well to take nothing away from them we came up against a side that were on their game and had a key player back in cesc fabregas who is a wonderful player
9236732 theyll be there or thereabouts again this year itll come down to which team beats which team at the top the same four teams are going to be there again theres no doubt about that
9236733 i think one of the problems weve had this year has been that we have been hit by a lot of injuries

9236754 one night i arrived home from a party with my friend an hour after the curfew imposed on her
9236755 we walked around the corner to find my dad standing in the dark with a gun pointed at us and we were terrified
9236756 he was pointing the gun at us as his way of teaching us a lesson about punctuality
9236757 in 1992 when i was about 18 i sometimes forgot to flush the toilet out of laziness in my own private bathroom one time he went into the bathroom and saw that my toilet was not flushed and he pulled me out of a chair in the living room dragged me into the bathroom lifted the toilet seat up and pushed my face inside of the toilet bowl into my own urine to teach me a lesson about flushing toilets

9236986 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9236987 i think john mccain won the state of alaska but lost the nation

9237019 everybody says this is somehow revealing the ugly underbelly of schools
9237020 is this revealing the ugly underbelly of underperforming schools or the ugly underbelly of a society that really doesnt want to face racism and poverty
9237021 we would have no leverage to bring to light the problems associated with the achievement gap and thats at the heart of what the spirit of the law is about transparency are we doing the job or not
9237022 we maybe havent been able to differentiate instruction as effectively as we could
9237023 sometimes an african american child might get labeled as not knowing something when you just have to explain it in a different way
9237024 you dont want your kids to be identified as special ed just because a teacher misunderstood them
9237025 in the past it might take two weeks to dig out information and do analysis on student data
9237026 and now we can have the answer within five seconds
9237027 its helped us look at whether what were doing to teach a child is producing the results we want it to
9237028 no child left behind is a slogan and slogans dont educate kids
9237029 how we teach it is pretty much the same at all the schools
9237030 weve got to address those challenges and accept no excuses
9237031 every student that comes to our buildings can learn and thats what really matters to us
9237032 its not something that we want to see its not something we feel good about and something needs to be addressed
9237033 we need to find out how we are going to come up with strategies to help our kids navigate this
9237034 everybody knew the piece of reality that its just one day and one test and a small group over time
9237035 all scripture is inspired by god and is profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training in righteousness that the man of god may be adequate equipped for every good work
9237036 the things i write to you are the lords commandment
9237037 then the lord stretched out his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said to me
9237038 above all you must understand that no prophesy of scripture came about by the prophets own interpretation for prophecy never had its origin in the will of man but men spoke from god as they were carried along by the holy spirit
9237039 we constantly thank god that when you received from us the word of gods message you accepted it not as the word of men but for what it really is the word of god
9237040 its always disappointing but its a program that the league has set up and something that i understand and jesse understands the consequences of
9237041 jesse has had a very good training camp and really punctuated it with his game against the eagles hes disappointed and so am i but i look forward to him being able to come back and contribute
9237042 never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9237043 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9237044 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now he has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9237045 i respect the program the league has in place and its very clear that if theres a violation there are consequences
9237046 my experience with jesse since hes been a new york jet has been extremely positive i think hes done everything weve asked him to do
9237047 tony richardson has run the ball in the past and wide receiver brad smith can be used back there as well so well definitely have alternatives in place
9237048 had this not gone through he would be on the 53 man roster
9237049 in terms of evaluating him as a player and a contributor i think he earned that spot from that perspective
9237050 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9237051 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9237052 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9237053 little bit of nervousness in my first game in my hometown
9237054 thirty people here to see me and i just let it overwhelm me

9237059 she said some guy had walked out of the casino and this guy just shot him in the back of the head
9237060 she didnt say how many times just that the guy was shot in the back of the head and another person got hurt
9237061 when rcmp officers attended there were fights outside as well as they reported that a shooting had just occurred outside
9237062 we were in the room and there was a siren and then a voice came on saying there was a fire warning and to stand by
9237063 so we got ready and then another male voice came on and said to please vacate the building
9237064 mum read through the list of common side affects of surgery today apparently temporary memory loss is quite normal boy is that a relief to hear

9237066 the influence of parc was strong in the project but not through a formal relationship with parc
9237067 more through parc people getting wind of what we were doing and coming to work at apple
9237068 and what that means is that when youre passionate about what youre doing youll take ideas from anywhere and with no guilt
9237069 you want to make the best possible thing and that was our mentality

9237076 audrey is barely getting by all she takes are easy classes she never studies and she barely has a 2 0 gpa she is so popular on campus college for her is a blast shes always invited to all the parties and lots of times she doesnt even show up for classes because shes too hung over
9237077 why dont you go to the deans office and ask him to deduct 1 0 off your gpa and give it to your friend who only has a 2 0 that way you will both have a 3 0 gpa and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of gpa
9237078 thats a crazy idea how would that be fair ive worked really hard for my grades ive invested a lot of time and a lot of hard work audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree she played while i worked my tail off

9237109 the world is going through constant change just because weve had an islamic revolution doesnt mean we dont learn from the good works of other parts of the world
9237110 in reality this is a political current constructed by the state in order to present personalities from the conservatives like qalibaf as reformists
9237111 we sit down at one table to talk about specific issues such as iraq
9237112 this shows that we can sit down at other tables too and talk with the u s on other issues
9237113 one thing mccain may want to consider is that gustav though its getting all the attention right now isnt the only tropical threat out there the one on the right is tropical storm hanna which could be menacing florida by the end of the week at present it is not officially forecasted to become a hurricane but that could change some of the models think it could be a category 2 or 3 hurricane in three days time if that happens a couple days delay in the convention could potentially create a new conflict this time involving the convention coinciding with a landfalling hurricane in the key electoral swing state of florida

9237151 how wonderful to have this vibrant community of artists and jazz music lovers in a mecca at our fingertips thank you jaijai for creating an innovative forum for all of us to connect and share as a native of chicagos southside i was blessed to have been exposed to some of the most talented musicians and performers in our industry and owe so much of my style to the influences of the veterans that came before me i am proud and honored to be a part of this network and grateful to all of your support peace amp blessings lori jenaire
9237152 the jazz network has been amazingly great for me and my music ive also discovered some very talented individuals here on the jazz network and reconnected with old friends and fans jaijai did an incredible thing when she created this awesome network im extremely proud to be a member of the jazz network and to turn my friends and colleagues onto it
9237153 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy
9237154 it was a pleasure to be featured on the jazz network main page
9237155 id just as soon not go through it again to be honest with you
9237156 its a job where you are always second to a dog
9237157 its a testament to our offensive line a lot of times we got to the second level without being touched this is what we were looking for and its what we got today
9237158 it feels good and exciting to get back out there
9237159 i think we are headed in the right direction and this is going to be a great season for our football team
9237160 i am really pleased i think our defense is much improved from last season and they tackled really well at times today but youve got to understand that we are outweighed up front by 30 to 40 pounds in every position
9237161 it was sad and i went in there and saw him at halftime
9237162 hell probably be stronger next year and hell be in better condition if in fact he has to go through that type of rehab
9237163 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9237164 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9237165 when you see one of the best backs in the country laying there in pain its definitely something that you dont want to see
9237166 beanies a tough guy i know were all pulling for him hes gone to the doctors and hell do whatever he can to help this team out
9237167 i was a little nervous but you should be my teammates helped me
9237168 its embarrassing to lose 43 0 in front of friends and family
9237169 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9237170 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9237171 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9237172 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9237173 you can just sense that if you give him time back there hes going to find guys and hes got a real attitude about him to take advantage of it
9237174 the only way to bounce back from a game like this is to take it as a learning experience
9237175 we will have a lot of work to do in practice
9237176 i moved when i needed to and was really happy out there
9237177 its something they have across the board at every position and they really were able to use it to their advantage
9237178 can you expect that from us i dont know theres some guys that when they touch the ball and if you make a mistake they can score on you fun to watch
9237179 but its going to be hard not to have tebow carry the ball at certain times in the game its all to take the wear and tear off of tim and not to lean on him too much but we all know at the end of the day will carry the mail for us in critical situations
9237180 we have a little thing coach says in practice you put the money in the bank in games you get to take it out today was payday for us i knew we were going to come out do some big stuff i just got paid today
9237181 a key for us today was getting out there and using all those weapons
9237182 were better than that were going to come back stronger
9237183 the offensive line is doing great right now and theyre only going to get better our rushing game is going to be the strength of this team and were going to get those guys in the pocket comfortable
9237184 we probably tried to force the pass as best we could just to get some of these young guys some experience
9237185 it was 7 0 and i looked at the scoreboard to see if there was room for three digits
9237186 were balanced in both throwing and running it but were definitely running the ball really well
9237187 it starts with the o line the veteran group they did a great job run blocking making some nice holes for charles and when i had a few carries i got some great blocks
9237188 theyre so much faster than michigan was we knew theyd have tight coverage but we couldnt execute one on one like we wanted
9237189 as i tried say way back and no one would believe me if you put nine people in the box were going to throw the football its the only thing i know how to do
9237190 we think pat white is an underrated passer i think its really going to help him as a pro prospect
9237191 when you score sometimes that makes up for time of possession
9237192 i hated to throw the ball at the end because coach talley is a good friend of mine
9237193 but he didnt take nine men out of the box
9237194 we were in a position when it was 17 0 and everybodys saying oh thats just what we do
9237195 i dont know if there was the urgency in the second quarter but they restored the roar in the third
9237196 you want to show them that its going to be a long day
9237197 its not going to be easy badger football we play physical football straight at you nothing too fancy eventually its going to wear you down
9237198 i should have known better than reaching with the ball
9237199 we closed out the first half pretty well we were in it at halftime and we were excited coming out for the second half it just fell apart for us
9237200 were going to have to play extremely well and theyre going to have to make some mistakes to have that opportunity
9237201 they did make those mistakes but we didnt take advantage of them and then had a couple momentum shifts early in the second half that didnt help us
9237202 our inexperience and youth showed obviously up front defensively they handled us pretty well and wore us down i bet they do that quite a bit this year
9237203 i think that quarterback is a good football player he missed some throws there but hopefully we had something to do with that
9237204 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9237205 its a story of a group of young men that have come together and said were tired of losing
9237206 their working very hard for that on the field and im very proud of them
9237207 it hit my arm i was just looking around to see if anyone else could scoop and score
9237208 but i got a good bounce and came right to my hands i just took it
9237209 to have the opportunity to come over here and play in a 70 000 seat nfl stadium great city where the fan base was pretty much even to play a bcs team what a great way to open the season
9237210 do i feel i played good 90 percent of the time yeah
9237211 but a senior quarterbacks got to play good 100 percent of the time
9237212 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9237213 i can only say it so many times its not a big deal to me
9237214 as much as you can expect in an opening game like this
9237215 it was a great feeling in front of 110 000 fans ill never do that again
9237216 when you first start you want everything to go right
9237217 youre the team that he beats to tie the record
9237218 unless you study the game you dont understand the implications of a win like that
9237219 i didnt hear a whistle it was probably some pitt guy blowing the whistle
9237220 we made so many mistakes today and the defense had my number
9237221 im sure the team is hurt im sure nobody expected this its tough
9237222 we were hearing everything about lesean mccoy and their great running game so we wanted to make sure we handled that and tried to get them into passing
9237223 that bowl loss lingered and i get asked about that to this day thats done i hope
9237224 they gave us some unusual formations and we had a tough time adjusting to it

9237226 he was one of the finest people i have ever known
9237227 i bought a sailboat and didnt know a thing about it
9237228 we didnt have any buildings we didnt have any money we didnt have any idea how to go about forming a college
9237229 watching the college grow was like watching his children grow
9237230 he worked his way through college doing woodworking and cabinetry
9237231 he was an absolutely immaculate workman his woodworkings were really works of art
9237232 he could do anything and he was there for everybody
9237233 i was appalled at how flimsy the case is i was also appalled at the behaviour of many of those who helped produce the ipcc reports and by many of those who promote it
9237234 in particular i am referring to the arrogance the activities aimed at shutting down debate the outright fabrications the mindless defence of bogus science and the politicisation of the ipcc process and the science process itself
9237235 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9237236 and it is warm not something im really used to
9237237 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9237238 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9237239 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9237240 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9237241 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9237242 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9237243 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9237244 right now it appears to have restored a leaner version
9237245 im not sure when well have it back up the way it was

9237338 train your children with an abiding persuasion on your mind that much depends upon you
9237339 train them to habits of diligence and regularly about public means of grace
9237340 as a minister i cannot help remarking that there is hardly any subject about which people seem so tenacious as they are about their children i have sometimes been perfectly astonished at the slowness of sensible christian parents to allow that their own children are in fault or deserve blame there are not a few persons to whom i would far rather speak about their own sins than tell them their children had done anything wrong
9237341 remember children are born with a decided bias towards evil and therefore if you let them choose for themselves they are certain to choose wrong
9237342 kindness gentleness long suffering forbearance patience sympathy a willingness to enter into childish troubles a readiness to take part in childish joys these are the cords by which a child may be led most easily these are the clues you must follow if you would find the way to his heart

9237346 the ramsey county sheriffs dept and the sppd raided the rnc convergence space and detained over 50 people in an attempt to preempt planned protests of the rnc on monday looking for items found in any twin cities house like jars paint and rags this attempt to portray us as criminals and destroy our credibility has already backfired as evidenced by the masses who have come to support us we are now accused of a simple fire code violation which is outside the scope of the sheriffs department and clearly not justified provocation for a forceful raid with guns being drawn children and elderly people were inside the convergence center when the police violently busted down the doors the police may claim that the raid was executed according to protocol however the violence inherent in this action may only be a hint of the violence to be expected on monday and beyond and is only a hint at the violence perpetrated daily by the police the convergence center is simply a gathering place and is not used for illegal actions it is a place for workshops and trainings tonight we were watching films and sharing food this action will not deter us from our plans to protest the rnc on september 1st we want to invite all people who oppose this police oppression to join us on septemeber 1st see you in the streets

9237364 but we still have a shortfall in terms of a mounted capability for our marines with regard to the joint light tactical vehicle or making up the shortfall really in the efv you know we needed a little over 1 000 to be able to provide everybody a conveyance in the same vehicle that buy was essentially cut in half so theres a need out there for what my guys at quantico are calling an mpc a marine personnel carrier and so were going to try to sort out just what that vehicle needs to look like
9237365 two mpcs will lift a reinforced rifle squad permitting a greater degree of tactical dispersion

9237472 i dont use primary secondary terminology since i dont see my relationships as hierarchical
9237473 for me sex is about energy so breathing and heart connection are more important than ejaculation
9237474 im more sophisticated than the guy over there please sleep with me instead
9237475 i see polyamory as being more about relationships and intimacy while swinging is just about sex and sex without intimacy is just not where im at right now
9237476 im more sophisticated than the guy over there please sleep with me instead
9237477 if you start seeing someone else and id feel unsophisticated just saying that im jealous then ill reinterpret one of our agreements until im able to say you broke it
9237478 right now the most important things to me are building poly family and intentional community
9237479 im getting concerned that i wont always be able to easily find new partners plus im tired of driving from place to place and oh yeah im more sophisticated than the guy over there so please sleep with me instead
9237480 in our household the most important things are open communication and open process
9237481 i dont feel that we communicate on the same level and that you arent supporting me emotionally
9237482 im tired of you but it would make me seem less sophisticated and hence reduce my opportunities for further sexual relationships in this community to actually say that so bluntly so ill make this about vague failings on your part instead
9237483 i want to reserve the right to veto each of your partners no matter how much they respect our existing relationships so that youre de facto limited to monogamy while i play the field
9237484 i think that we should focus on each other for a while
9237485 im having more trouble finding partners than you are time to clip your wings
9237486 i want you to always feel ok telling me whats really going on in your life and asking for what you need in this relationship
9237487 ask for what you need and express hurt feelings at your peril
9237488 im not angry at you im angry at myself for not having recognized sooner that we werent right for each other
9237489 im angry at you for not making my life perfect but rather than taking responsibility for setting and meeting my own goals i find it more satisfying to shift the blame to you while superficially appearing to do the opposite
9237490 out of respect for our primary bond we normally only see other people together
9237491 maybe this time ill finally get to have sex with two women at once omg omg omg that would be l33t
9237492 i think we need to process the end of our relationship and get closure
9237493 were through i just want to vent a little more so that i can feel a little more self righteous once you know its over too ok
9237494 the idea of line marriage has always appealed to me

9237557 by actually working with the black lower class or within their communities as a result of their ideologies a separatist may better understand the desperation of their situation and feel more hopeless about a resolution as opposed to an integrationist who is ignorant to their plight
9237558 further integration and or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure that will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society never becoming a full participant
9237559 there was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the black community i am obligated to this community and will utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit the black community first and foremost
9237560 predominately white universities like princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments

9237612 id be creeped out by it not for me let us know how you get on though
9237613 these folks are always always always manipulating and thinking about their next move and the only way you can keep them off guard is to supervise them to the point where they have to worry about the next time theyre going to be checked
9237614 their thought process is different than the average person they have a single minded nature about the way they think about things
9237615 they have a need driven underlying fantasy to offend in a sexual way its almost like an addiction
9237616 you cant look at these people like you can save them i cant be any blunter than that
9237617 its not that they cant be controlled and its not like they cant function in society but thats going to have to be with a high level of supervision
9237618 that is going to have an impact on the entire community
9237619 its a person level crime a violent felony not to register or failing to follow one of the rules of the registry
9237620 its the same for everyone regardless of whether your underlying offense was a violent crime or not
9237621 looking at your drivers license they dont know what kind of offender you are
9237622 just the mere presence on the registry means that a lot of people wont give you the chance to explain yourself
9237623 purpose of warning the public certainly outweighs the individual privacy concerns or that type of thing
9237624 in general its viewed as someone in the bushes an older guy who is grabbing kids off the street trying to rape someone at random i think thats the viewpoint of a sex abuser

9237645 one thing i must admit a failure of lucidity understanding in regard to love it is so easy to assume that love is somehow a solution to a problem like life is a problem which is impossible until someone comes along that you can love or man is himself a problem solved by love love is a key to a hidden answer in us and so on but is this true or is it only what everybody wants to be true maybe love like everything else is in large measure absurd does love too have to make perfect sense in what way does it have to
9237646 the sense that love makes and i think the only sense it makes is to the one who is greatly loved

9237958 man were having all kinds of problems i wish we had someone on our team who could reference and draw conclusions from the story of siddhartha that would pull up our fourth quarter numbers
9237959 a major in religion offers intellectual excitement and can be a pathway to a liberal education

9237961 its not a curfew but as if emergency rule has been imposed here
9237962 comply with international human rights principles in controlling the demonstrators
9237963 despite the apparent strength the nato naval group in the black sea is not battle worthy
9237964 if necessary a single missile salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or three missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group
9237965 we will not strike first and they do not look like people with suicidal tendencies
9237966 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9237967 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
9237968 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
9237969 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
9237970 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9237971 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9237972 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9237973 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9237974 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9237975 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9237976 agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non existent threats concerning other post soviet countries
9237977 i would not be surprised if this integration process would be going even quicker
9237978 i think there should be an adequate reaction by nato to russias incursion
9237979 we are looking forward to the eu council on monday to define a unified position supporting politically and economically georgia and hopefully sending a strong message to russia
9237980 appeasement policy would be more dangerous it is not europes choice nor ours nor of the west russians have chosen this way of behaviour
9237981 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9237982 sources familiar with the plans of advanced micro devices on wednesday denied the fact that the company has plans to release dual core amd phenom processors but said that the chipmaker plans to release dual core chips based on the k10 micro architecture under the amd athlon x2 brand name
9237983 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno luno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io sar per te unica al mondo
9237984 la mia vita monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio perci ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita sar illuminata conoscer un rumore di passi che sar diverso da tutti gli altri gli altri passi mi fanno nascondere sotto terra il tuo mi far uscire dalla tana come una musica e poi guarda vedi laggi in fondo dei campi di grano io non mangio il pane e il grano per me inutile i campi di grano non mi ricordano nulla e questo triste ma tu hai dei capelli color delloro allora sar meraviglioso quando mi avrai addomesticato il grano che dorato mi far pensare a te e amer il rumore del vento nel grano
9237985 ma non ho molto tempo per ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
9237986 gli uomini non hanno pi tempo per conoscere nulla comprano dai mercanti le cose gi fatte ma siccome non esistono mercanti di amici gli uomini non hanno pi amici se tu vuoi un amico addomesticami
9237987 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cos nellerba io ti guarder con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po pi vicino
9237988 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincer ad essere felice col passare dellora aumenter la mia felicit quando saranno le quattro incomincer ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scoprir il prezzo della felicit ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapr mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
9237989 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore c un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il giovedi ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il giovedi un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
9237990 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
9237991 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua unica al mondo quando ritornerai a dirmi addio ti regaler un segreto
9237992 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
9237993 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico ed ora per me unica al mondo
9237994 ecco il mio segreto e molto semplice non si vede bene che col cuore lessenziale invisibile agli occhi
9237995 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cos importante
9237996 e il tempo che ho perduto per la mia rosa
9237997 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verit ma tu non la devi dimenticare tu diventi responsabile per sempre di quello che hai addomesticato tu sei responsabile della tua rosa
9237998 itd be nice to finish the race you know weve had a rough couple of weeks and weve tore up a bunch of racecars
9237999 i was listening to the radio broadcast of the race after we fell out at bristol and they were talking about some new rivalry between carl edwards and kyle busch well ive got some news theres another big rivalry taking place here lately and its the caterpillar camry versus the wall right now the wall is kicking our tail wall three cat camry zero its tough and we dont mean to make light of the situation but at this point all you can do is shake your head and wonder what you have to do to get a break
9238000 so far yes its been a little bit frustrating and disappointing
9238001 we want to win we want to be competitive we came off such a great year last year our team has been phenomenal this year we just havent had the runs havent had the cars and when we did have the cars havent been able to put it all together so thats definitely been frustrating
9238002 i feel like were fine on the short tracks its just the mile and a half stuff that we need to be a little stronger at to really put a fight up for these guys
9238003 i think were there i really do so its not that were behind you would always like to be ahead and thats why were still testing and doing all we can we should be a factor in this thing
9238004 cheating the bad things good nascar nextel cup racers do in pursuit of speed
9238005 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the
9238006 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9238007 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9238008 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9238009 it would appear that bryans may be taking part in unofficial discussions
9238010 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9238011 i am not sure that this is a very desirable point of view to publish at the present time
9238012 bryans is a talkative and indiscreet fellow who is in possession of a story which he delights in telling and which if told publicly would be likely to cause embarrassment to the foreign office
9238013 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy
9238014 it occurs to me that this is a possible means of putting deception over to the enemy by the careful framing of the questionnaires as presumably the germans must if they capture some of these birds take notice of the type of question which is being asked
9238015 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9238016 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9238017 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9238018 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9238019 a fire at a rubber plant in brimfield saturday night sparked fears of an explosion
9238020 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms im not sure weve ever seen anything like it
9238021 the abruzzese are not the type to go out and promote themselves or their region which is why abruzzo has been under the tourism radar for so long but as the experience of country italy in abruzzo becomes more popular the wonderful food and wine is being discovered as well
9238022 my family is from abruzzo and my extended family still lives there so michael and i are continually adding new things to the itineraries so we can offer the best of abruzzo there is so much in abruzzo the only proper way to experience it is through people who really know it
9238023 along with the amazing sightseeing adventure that unfolds as the train makes its way north viewing these magnificent animals during the prime season makes the hudson bay service one of the most unique rail experiences to be found in the world

9238061 but we must begin by giving up any idea that we can bring about these healings without fundamental changes in the way we think and live
9238062 we know from history that massive human faliure is possible it is foolish to assume that we will save ourselves from any fate that we have made possible simply because we have the conceit to call ourselves
9238063 but we have not only the example of nature we have still though few and widely scattered sufficient examples of competent and loving human stewardship of the earth we have too our own desire to be healthy in a healthy world surely most of us still have somewhere within us the fundamental human wish to die in a world in which we have been glad to live and we are in spite of much evidence to the contrary somewhat sapient we can think if we will if we know carefully enough who what and where we are and if we keep the scale of our work small enough we can think responsibly these assets are not gigantic technical and costly equipment that we tend to think we need but they are enough they are in fact gods plenty because we have these assets which are the supports of our legitimate hope we can start from where we are with what we have and imagine and work for the healings that are necessary
9238064 if we wan to succeed in our dearest aims and hopes as a people we must understand that we cannot proceed any further without standards and we must see that ultimately the standards are not set by us but by nature we must see that it is foolish sinful and suicidal to destroy the health of nature for the sake of an economy that is really not an economy at all but merely a financial system one that is unnatural undemocratic sacrilegious and ephemeral we must see the error of our effort to live by fire by burning the world in order to live in it there is no plainer symptom of our insanity than our avowed intention to maintain by fire an unlimited economic growth

9238067 you might need to add more classrooms and then that would be a bond issue for the voters
9238068 obviously you can do nothing at all and take a financial hit
9238069 when we barely have money to pay for the basics why are we adding things on
9238070 i voted against the bill not for that reason but that was one of the reasons
9238071 i told the governor that advocating for an increase in the number of hours may not be a bad idea
9238072 ive been a long and strong supporter of early childhood education
9238073 i think all day kindergarten does make a lot of sense theresresearch out there that shows its important to a childs development
9238074 were keenly aware of that and well have to plan accordingly
9238075 in fact it will be a timely piece as we plan for a bond issue
9238076 we are purchasing one in the presidential election to see how it goes
9238077 we are always looking for ways to improve the efficiency of the process
9238078 obviously were just shocked by what happened and were not going to leave two kids behind as a family thats always been with them
9238079 there was a huge turnover there a few years ago and now weve got it here so were hoping to give them more of a run for their money this year
9238080 we dont practice the only time we play is one time per year and thats labor day
9238081 and i still cherish that scrapbook she wrote four line couplets in iambic pentameter to accompany photos articles and illustrations each family really treasured receiving one
9238082 when i think of fritzi the word that comes to mind is joy
9238083 joy radiated from her it wasnt a facile or false happiness it was joy born of overcoming lifes difficulties and recognizing gods presence in her life

9238088 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9238089 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9238090 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9238091 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9238092 nobody was vetted less or more than anyone in the final stages and john had access to all that information and made the decision
9238093 wootens words were i will kill him hell eat a expletive lead bullet ill shoot him if our father got the attorney to help molly
9238094 i heard this death threat my 16 year old son heard it track palin molly heard it as did their small children wooten spoke with his trooper gun on his hip in an extremely intimidating fashion leaving no doubt he is serious about taking someones life who disagrees with him
9238095 my concern is that the publics faith in the trooper will continue to diminish as more residents express concerns regarding the apparent lack of action towards a trooper whom is described by many as a ticking time bomb and a loose cannon
9238096 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9238097 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9238098 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9238099 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9238100 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9238101 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9238102 must add urgency to the work on europes energy agenda
9238103 we must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9238104 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9238105 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9238106 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9238107 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9238108 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9238109 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9238110 there was just a look in everyones eye its not something ive seen in the last couple years of utah football
9238111 i felt the difference in the game was who would rush the ball better
9238112 we wanted to wear them down and we wanted to wear them out we didnt do it by much but im telling you a one point difference in any sporting event makes a huge difference
9238113 we felt coming into the game that it would be like that and in the second half we didnt have good enough field position to make plays
9238114 i think they might have started getting a little worn out by the end there
9238115 our guys were kind of getting momentum and we were running the ball great
9238116 we had a bunch of guys playing their very first game it was evident we need to develop and grow as a team rapidly and i think we can do that
9238117 we had a bunch of brand new faces out there as much as you try to simulate in practice its a lot harder its a lot more tough and a lot more violent when you play a game
9238118 you are always prepared to play the whole game because you never know when you will play that much
9238119 ill be real honest with you we dont have a lot of play calls inside the 20
9238120 we stubbed our foot a lot it doesnt surprise me we made mistakes
9238121 we wanted to come out fast and keep it on them
9238122 i was feeling good i was kind of confident on that one
9238123 we were slow and dry and boring in the first half
9238124 i dont feel any different im just having fun with this
9238125 i never said i have a girlfriend and i never said i dont have a girlfriend
9238126 my public and private life are separate i keep my private life to myself
9238127 well see if i really am a fish out of water and if i have a comedic side to me all of my friends are giving me a hard time about it and saying i better not mess up and better not do this or do that
9238128 this night of witness is extremely important for we muslims it is the night that unifies us all
9238129 because of the nature of global telecommunications we are playing with a tremendous home field advantage and we need to exploit that edge
9238130 we also need to protect that edge and we need to protect those who provide it to us

9238142 div asked mnstc i for the frago that mnc i was supposed to publish but couldnt because mnf i hadnt weighed in since they were too inundated with mod and moi war gaming the jccs within the isf to square us away
9238143 imagine the stories if we can show them in pictures in books and films
9238144 the central theme is that before you find peace and harmony there has to be clashes but theres a peaceful way to do it thats why there should be a need to look at these books to feature more untold stories that promote peace from our communities
9238145 but there are many things that have not yet come to pass as i walk the mountain trails i am still confronted by sad images of massive poverty landless peasants with limited tools emaciated old people malnourished children with bloated stomachs houses ready to collapse and roads that are also the riverbeds
9238146 take a stand about sacrificing personal dreams and even lives for causes larger than ones own
9238147 this is the first year thats one of the goals
9238148 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9238149 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9238150 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9238151 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9238152 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9238153 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9238154 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9238155 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9238156 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9238157 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9238158 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9238159 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity

9238167 ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country
9238168 praise god from whom all blessings flow praise him all creatures here below
9238169 prayer is not a normal part of the life of the natural man
9238170 ask and you will receive john 16 24 we complain before god and sometimes we are apologetic or indifferent to him but we actually ask him for very few things yet a child exhibits a magnificent boldness to ask our lord said
9238171 the problem is that no one will ever do this until he is at his wits end
9238172 to say that prayer changes things is not as close to the truth as saying prayer changes me and then i change things god has established things so that prayer on the basis of redemption changes the way a person looks at things prayer is not a matter of changing things externally but one of working miracles in a persons inner nature

9238198 it is affirmed by some that labor is the only true measure of value that every thing is worth precisely what it costs in labor to produce it and that the price of every thing ought always to be determined by the relative amount of labor expended in its production we would remark in answer to these affirmations that there is such a thing as misdirected labor and that a man may produce an article for which there is no demand and which has consequently no exchangeable value again peter working upon a poor soil may with an incredible expenditure of labor produce a bushel of corn while john working on rich land may raise a like quantity in the same time and with comparatively little labor now we venture to affirm that the market value of these two bushels of corn will and ought to depend not on the relative quantities of labor expended in their production but on the relative excellence of the price or value determined by the law of supply and demand

9238203 air in most situations is in unlimited abundance it is therefore not a means and is not employed as a means to the fulfillment of ends it need not be allocated as time is to the satisfaction of the more important ends since it is sufficiently abundant for all human requirements air then though indispensable is not a means but a general condition of human action and human welfare
9238204 communism the first expression of the social nature is the first term of social development the thesis property the reverse of communism is the second term the antithesis when we have discovered the third term the synthesis we shall have the required solution now this synthesis necessarily results from the correction of the thesis by the antithesis therefore it is necessary by a final examination of their characteristics to eliminate those features which are hostile to sociability the union of the two remainders will give us the true form of human association

9238207 liberty is an absolute right because it is to man what impenetrability is to matter
9238208 lois blanc has gone so far as to reverse the republican motto he no longer says liberty equality fraternity he says equality fraternity liberty equality i had thought that it was the natural fruit of liberty which has no need of theory nor constraint
9238209 1 the free market any economic order that emerges from voluntary exchanges of property and labor free of government intervention and other forms of systemic coercion 2 the corporate state government intervention favoring cartelized big business through subsidies tax funded infrastructure central banking production boards eminent domain seizures government union busting etc 3 alienation of labor a specific form of labor market in which the dominant economic activity is production in workplaces strictly divided by class where most workers work for a boss in return for a wage surviving by renting out their labor to someone else the shop and the tools and facilities that make it run are owned by the boss or by absentee owners to whom the boss reports not by the workers themselves
9238210 freedom is the absolute right of every adult man and woman to seek no other sanction for their acts than their own conscience and their own reason being responsible first to themselves and then to the society which they have accepted

9238217 i told you that you would die in your sins if you do not believe that i am you will indeed die in your sins

9238220 the bible is gods word to the extent that he speaks through it
9238221 barth spoke of the bible becoming rather than being the word of god
9238222 as we noted earlier it is not the bible as a book that is authoritative but the bible as the instrumentality of the spirit the biblical message spoken by the spirit through the text is theologys norming norm
9238223 i regret any embarrassment this may cause to an administration that is attempting to make the transportation cabinet transparent and forthright
9238224 due to the potential perceived conflict of interest i am requesting that other members of my staff as needed attend any meetings correspondence etc that may pertain to the u s hwy 421 south project
9238225 while i respect the work done by mr newman and have no reason to question their intent in this matter even the perception of a potential conflict must be avoided
9238226 he handled it very professionally and was honest and ethical with us
9238227 there is no way i can ever re enter any facet of the kentucky transportation industry
9238228 the last worst thing is what you are remembered for
9238229 the fbi the u s department of transportation they wont find anything
9238230 65 of those yards coming off a touchdown pass on the final play of the first half
9238231 we were going to let the clock run out and just end the half i decided to call a timeout and try another play we just ran a fade route to one of our best athletes on the field he made a nice post move and broke it back up the sideline and the corner bit on it and keri threw it up it bounced off the dbs hands and into dwights and he had some concentration and caught it
9238232 we just picked the right times to throw it tonight offensive coordinator shane smith did an excellent job making offensive calls and the kids executed
9238233 its something we concentrated on this year and thought that weve got to do
9238234 weve put some expectations on him and he lived up to it
9238235 it was at a point where we make three stops and we win the game or let them get in the end zone and they win the game
9238236 nothing special its just something theyve had to learn to do
9238237 they saw what happened last year they draw a lot from last year even though they werent on the field
9238238 id like to say we had one corner stay in position but we kept cramping up
9238239 we went through three or four corners we had kids playing corner that hadnt even practiced at corner this year so it wasnt one person
9238240 we got pressure on the quarterback which made up for some of our inexperience in the secondary
9238241 everyone talks about last year and some people still talk about the orange bowl year but that is irrelevant
9238242 for a lot of guys this will be their first real experience
9238243 its on the road itll be noisy a different atmosphere than theyve ever experienced how those guys respond is key to the outcome of the game
9238244 every year that i have played here whether uk was supposed to be down or we were supposed to be down i always saw both teams come in and play above and beyond what most people expected
9238245 win or lose the game doesnt make the end all for season or tell all for the season but i sure would like chances of having a good year after the win
9238246 its a chance to get things moving in the right direction and hopefully that positive momentum continues to go throughout the course of the season
9238247 you add the fact that its uk that makes it more special its a special game not only in the state but in the country everybody is going to be watching it
9238248 id like to think this kind of political thuggery would come to an end if obama were elected but of course this is being done to protect the democratic national convention
9238249 as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged and it is in such twilight that we must be most aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness
9238250 were well positioned and weve got a good set of plans and now were waiting to put them into motion
9238251 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9238252 we are still in the cone of probability especially for a storm surge
9238253 i am strongly encouraging people in the city to evacuate all tourists i ask you to leave do not wait
9238254 they dont want to leave without their dogs i cant blame them i wouldnt leave without mine
9238255 this time we have 1 500 police officers and 1 500 to 2 000 national guard double the amount of protection during katrina
9238256 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9238257 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9238258 no barrier no boundary all hours i please the freedom to stay all stray be fiend or friend cause no harm but charm the peaceful end
9238259 if its the last thing i do i will get that ban dropped
9238260 they will be nice enough to let me visit him
9238261 pit bulls are actually very sweet they should put money in to anti cruelty laws
9238262 we want him to go out of state so he doesnt come back
9238263 they havet solved a thing until they eliminate this ban
9238264 he influenced his colleagues and peers and generations of young artists he was funny open hearted poetic he was making beautiful paintings just a few days ago
9238265 what sets chisman apart from many other local painters is his ability to reinvent and reinvigorate his work with each new body of paintings all while still maintaining a style that is quickly identifiable as his
9238266 he was very generous of spirit very quick to laugh he helped the community by teaching he was compassionate he was a good man
9238267 god is reminding us on the anniversary of katrina that he can send mother nature back
9238268 i want to put everyone on alert that this storm is a very serious matter
9238269 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level
9238270 its not the wind or the water im worried about
9238271 the police couldnt protect anybody the last time and i have no confidence things will be any different now
9238272 the stress is obviously compounded by the fact that there is now the threat of a major hurricane again
9238273 people are worrying what will happen to their homes they have worked so hard to rebuild people are tired theyve been through so much
9238274 we are lifelong 9th ward residents but it really makes you wonder if its all going to be worth it again
9238275 agencies had caught on that chennault was the go between between nixon and his people and president thieu in saigon the idea was to bring things to a stop in paris and prevent any show of progress
9238276 im speaking on behalf of mr nixon its very important that our vietnamese friends understand our republican position and i hope you made that clear to them
9238277 many republican friends have contacted me and encouraged me to stand firm
9238278 the longer the present situation continues the more favorable for us i am regularly in touch with the nixon entourage
9238279 in the end though johnsons advisers decided it was too late and too potentially damaging to u s interests to uncover what had been going on
9238280 if nixon should emerge as the victor what would the chennault outrage do to his viability as an incoming president and what effect would it have on american opinion about the war
9238281 you couldnt surface it the country would be in terrible trouble
9238282 you should know that in 1980 the republicans approached me with an arms deal if i could arrange to keep the hostages in iran until after the elections
9238283 the offer to arafat was if you block the release of hostages then the white house would be open for the plo
9238284 i guess the same offer was given to others and i believe that some accepted to do it and managed to block the release of hostages
9238285 told me that if i do not accept this proposal they the republicans would make the same offer to my rivals
9238286 lastly he told me my refusal of their offer would result in my elimination
9238287 hypothetically speaking president bush advised that he would not have directed anyone to investigate the possibility that clinton had renounced his citizenship because he would have relied on others to make this decision
9238288 he bush would have said something like lets get it out or hope the truth gets out
9238289 jim baker came in here this morning about 10 30 deeply disturbed and read to me a long letter of resignation all because of this stupid passport situation
9238290 communists new leftists and other revolutionaries who would destroy the entire system both political and economic
9238291 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
9238292 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
9238293 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
9238294 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
9238295 you have to cry and try and figure out what in the world could i do
9238296 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9238297 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
9238298 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9238299 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
9238300 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
9238301 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
9238302 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9238303 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9238304 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9238305 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9238306 i think obama was trying to bait john mccain i think obama was trying to get john mccain mad for next week
9238307 i think obama wanted to start a donnybrook and i think he probably did
9238308 i think it turned out probably better than we could have hoped
9238309 we will no longer have a civilian intelligence arm yes we will have analysts but we wont have any real civilian intelligence capability
9238310 he is prejudiced against the cia the day after the 2004 election when bush won mccain came on tv and gave an interview in which he said something to the effect of the cia tried to sabotage this election theyve made their bed and now they have to lay in it i used to like mccain but he is inconsistent
9238311 with cia leaks intended to harm the re election campaign of the president of the united states it is not only dysfunctional but a rogue organization
9238312 who all had these long standing grudges against people in the agency
9238313 they think the cia is a hotbed of liberals right wing nutty paranoia stuff they all love the military and hate the cia because the cia tells them stuff they dont want to hear
9238314 an effective intelligence professional element that will take risks and will be responsive to civilian control and made up of the best and brightest officers the us has to offer
9238315 it has to have a civilian function but will have a vast military element as well i always say you have to keep the central in the central intelligence agency
9238316 lots of people talk to john on foreign policy matters not just randy scheunemann
9238317 there has been a battle within the mccain campaign between neoconservatives and realists but by and large neoconservatives hold the high ground
9238318 ive been in meetings with mccain where some adviser is discussing a policy issue
9238319 and at the end mccain thanks them and says hes made up his own mind and the outcome is the other way
9238320 but this is the guy who sat around talking to all of us when porter came in as cia director in 2004 and told us how much porter respected us and not to worry about the stories we hear he was trying to reassure us that goss was not out to destroy the agency he told us everything is going to be fine
9238321 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character i have a dream today
9238322 the acceptance of a democratic presidential nominee decided not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character
9238323 tell them about the dream martin tell them about the dream
9238324 so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream
9238325 we must face the tragic fact that the negro is still languishing in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land
9238326 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9238327 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
9238328 in the pennsylvania primary one in six white voters told exit pollsters race was a factor in his or her decision seventy five percent of those people voted for clinton twelve percent of the pennsylvania primary electorate acknowledged that it didnt vote for barack obama in part because he is african american
9238329 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
9238330 ith the execrable record of black governance both here and abroad as well as the cult of grievance that has been instilled in many blacks can one really blame them
9238331 illicit drugs and gangs and bad schools in minority communities

9238353 hey maybe this would be something nice to do for my friend
9238354 i bet some of amys friends and fans on the internet would enjoy and appreciate this since its likely most of them wouldnt be able to attend any kind of physical shower anyway
9238355 taste the baby food and guess what flavor it is
9238356 real life i just have to say how can you find a bad motive in a baby shower its babies love wrapped in a tiny bundle no one said you had to send a gift its optional even if you go to the book party which i cant go to wah i guess i missed where it said you had to buy amy a gift

9238359 american issues project clearly has struck a nerve inside the obama campaign but even more important is the reaction of the american people who are starting to question why sen obama would have such a close relationship with an unrepentant domestic terrorist
9238360 the heavy handed response of the obama campaign definitely misfired the more the obama campaign has tried to bully the ad off the air with its spurious legal threats and intimidation the more voters have wondered what he has to hide
9238361 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough

9238369 its a bit patronising for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
9238370 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
9238371 someone asked us to give a quote about what was happening in sheffield and its like who cares what we think about whats happening
9238372 theres more important people who can have an opinion why does it make us have an opinion because were in a band

9238381 to perform maintenance on the drainage ditch within the detention basin
9238382 hats off to her because its a tough job she will be missed greatly
9238383 too many companies are addicted to bad profits these corporate steroids boost short term earnings but burn out employees and alienate customers they undermine growth by creating legions of detractors customers who sully the firms reputation and switch to competitors at the earliest opportunity
9238384 analysis shows that on average increasing the nps by a dozen points versus the competition can double a companys growth rate
9238385 herding people into walled gardens and guessing about what makes them social will seem as absurd as it actually is
9238386 after all im a scientist we deal in hypotheses youre the executive you need to make the call on what to do with this
9238387 if your models are right we get to raise our rates because our competitors customers regulators and the general public are all looking at the same stuff convinced that your predictions are true is that what youre saying
9238388 the fossil record over several million years and agricultural evidence over several millennia would tend to suggest that storm activity actually decreases during warmer climatic periods and were just getting this new data in from deep ocean probes suggesting that 80 90 of the ocean volume is staying the same temperature or maybe getting colder it would be a bit hasty in my opinion for you to raise your rates based on a set of theories and prospective models that massive uncertainty if you just sign the proposal we put on your desk to study this a little further we can refine the numbers
9238389 are subjecting their businesses and their customers to the volatility of computer models
9238390 the models are being used as if they produce definitive answers rather than uncertain estimates
9238391 we are extremely pleased with and proud of our news gathering operation no outside arrangements are being negotiated
9238392 weve hired the best given them the best resources incented them up the wazoo and tried not to be too meddlesome those creative folks dont take well to corporate bureaucrats yknow
9238393 you remember that problem we thought would take twenty years to solve we finally got started on it and were targeting completion next wednesday
9238394 this would create additional courtroom conference and office space within the existing courthouse provide conference room office and courtroom space for the district court and prevent the further deterioration of a landmark building
9238395 before it is claimed that use of the former library for courthouse space cannot be done please recall that this building was originally a federal courthouse and continues to be well suited for such use
9238396 madison county has a separate well functioning district court facility in a building not as well suited to use as a courthouse as is the former paul sawyier library building to the franklin county courthouse
9238397 franklin county would not be doing something not done elsewhere nor would it be alone in having multiple buildings housing circuit family and district courts
9238398 the good shepherd property or at least a portion of it could be acquired and utilized for construction of garage space as well as additional office or storage space connected to the existing courthouse
9238399 this could provide a secure entrance to the existing courthouse resolving security concerns which seem to be the only justification for building a new courthouse
9238400 will serve to improve downtown preserve a historic building assist our good shepherd neighbors and provide the desired courthouse improvements without spending 30 million and uprooting an entire city block and its residents
9238401 so the j c watts federal building site on broadway could be used for the new franklin county judicial center
9238402 because its not usable for city purposes in its current condition
9238403 a gem sitting there very much like it sat in the 1880s the upper floors were never used much and the library board in the last 25 years has spent a fortune maintaining the building putting on a new roof and all kinds of stuff
9238404 the big offices on the third floor are absolutely magnificent
9238405 the main focus has been a stand alone judicial center building
9238406 i have talked with him but not a great deal about philosophy
9238407 i think the committee needs to explore all avenues and be mindful of what our judges our commonwealths attorney and county attorney our local bar association and the community as a whole have to say
9238408 we want to keep this project moving we really believe it is important to our community
9238409 but we would have to look and see what it would take to refurbish it
9238410 it would be very difficult to say whether it would be feasible without knowing the cost and what it would take to refurbish it
9238411 when we have looked at all the other locations we have investigated weve had the aid of our architects and construction manager to advise us as to whether there is enough space
9238412 just the idea of location i know courts use more than one building in other communities but it presents some challenges for court personnel to have things in another building we even have those challenges with family court being in a separate building
9238413 acquiring the watts building although it was determined unavailable annexing adjacent property to the current facility and renovating the courthouse
9238414 i think its a legitimate suggestion among various alternatives that might be considered
9238415 its a beautiful old building i dont know about the plumbing wiring and structural condition of it those are considerations that will have to be examined
9238416 weve talked to the kids about what they leave behind this year
9238417 down the road what youve left behind is in the record books and the win loss column your legacy thats where it comes from
9238418 we didnt realize it until the last couple of minutes
9238419 our base blocking was good on misdirection we didnt do a great job but that will come with game experience
9238420 i thought wesley watkins came out and did some things we thought he could do and tony houchin stepped up and did some good things tonight
9238421 i only got sacked once it actually surprised me at first it looked like kris long was getting bull rushed but he held his own against a 6 7 300 pound lineman
9238422 it was our first game and i thought it was going to be a little difficult
9238423 at first we struggled a little but then we started scoring and i thought this is not that hard
9238424 we had 188 yards of offense in the first half and we were inside their 20 a few times
9238425 coach joey thacker and coach chris thompson told me all week to split the safeties and thats what i did
9238426 i thought they were a better football team on film than they were last year
9238427 i never envisioned us putting it on them like we did coach wade williams is a good coach and he had a good game plan the plays where they scored they had us dead in the water
9238428 we need to shore up our inside zone play but that will come with experience kris long and corey craig theyre first time starters
9238429 ive played with so many good linemen in the past theres no pressure on me
9238430 i can handle it but you cant im not talking about our kids thats different
9238431 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
9238432 whatsoever ye would that others should do to you do ye even so to them
9238433 described me as a prisoner in the war between muslims and non muslims a phrase which saddened me really
9238434 i guess im a non muslim but im really not at war with anybody
9238435 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
9238436 id like to thank governor palin for being here i know shes a new mother for a fifth time and i think its great shes able to make time from her family and her newborn to participate in this rigorous campaign
9238437 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
9238438 the truth is that nobody of the top ten in my division wants to fight me
9238439 she wouldnt have articulated one coherent policy and people would just be fawning all over her
9238440 tony and i looked at each other and it was like this isnt about policy or alaska issues this is about peoples most basic instincts i like you and you make me feel good
9238441 wouldnt it be nice if we could raise the dead like jesus if we could then aunt ruth i mean grandma ruth would be living and so would carly
9238442 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
9238443 i cant claim a bill clinton and say that i never inhaled
9238444 the green party has gained its first ever member of parliament blair wilson a vancouver area independent who quit the liberal party last year green party leader elizabeth may introduced wilson at a news conference saturday morning in ottawa the mp for the west vancouver sunshine coast sea to sky country riding was turfed from the liberal caucus last year after allegations of spending irregularities in his 2006 campaign wilson reminded reporters that he was cleared of any wrongdoing after an eight month investigation by elections canada may said her party welcomes the mp because he gives the greens a voice in parliamentary debates she also said having wilson on her team means she should be allowed to take part in the televised leaders debate in the next federal election campaign
9238445 do you believe the greens should be in those debates
9238446 we just want canadians to see the guy we work with every day
9238447 ant build pleasegod dtest john3 16 to have the initial project actually work then it sucks
9238448 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
9238449 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
9238450 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
9238451 palin has zero foreign policy experience so she s not ready to be president yet
9238452 are you envious or threatened that shes both smart and pretty
9238453 yeah unlike liberals we dont want our women to be ass ugly lesbians like hillary
9238454 must be a real bitch when all you can do is point out how hot she is
9238455 this gives a lot of women and men for that matter an excuse to not vote for the obamamessiah
9238456 i am sure mccain will win the vote by the slimmest of margins
9238457 while running for governor of alaska palin advocated the teaching of both creationism and evolution in public schools but the next day she said
9238458 religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9238459 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class
9238460 my dad did talk a lot about his theories of evolution she said
9238461 asked for her personal views on evolution palin said i believe we have a creator she would not say whether her belief also allowed her to accept the theory of evolution as fact im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be she said
9238462 palin has announced plans to create a new sub cabinet group of advisors to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions within alaska after she was announced as mccains presumptive running mate she stated that she does not believe that climate change is man made
9238463 palin has strongly promoted oil resource development in alaska including opening the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling
9238464 she has also helped pass a tax increase on oil company profits
9238465 her evident distaste for the office would be part of her appeal it would show mccain is running an anti washington reformist campaign
9238466 palin said last year that she vetoed some energy projects because they were premature she wanted to wait for a study on a possible railbelt electrical grid authority before signing off on individual projects the final draft of that study is due in late may
9238467 had been mired in a dispute between local and state governments
9238468 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
9238469 our focus is really on this side of the river
9238470 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9238471 i could really just go for a big tub of popcorn
9238472 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
9238473 why if species have descended from other species by fine graduation do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being as we see them well defined

9238476 it would be beneath me to respond to their ridiculous contentions
9238477 prime minister stephen harper and several of his most powerful cabinet ministers met last week at historic willson house on a promontory overlooking meech lake in qu becs gatineau park and decided they must call a federal election before three by elections set for sept
9238478 i know for certain p and p cabinets influential planning and priorities committee was told last week
9238479 they had a political discussion and during that political discussion they concluded that all things being equal they would like to go before the eighth
9238480 obviously at that point there were some outstanding issues how to respond to the opposition leaders but it was agreed that they would go before the eighth if at all possible and this fall for sure
9238481 and so in less than four weeks mr harper and his strategists moved dramatically and swiftly from insisting they wanted to govern until october 2009 the fixed election date to a probable general election this fall how did this happen
9238482 its trademark harper in that hes making an unexpected decision and once he makes it hes going to pursue it full steam ahead and take the gamble
9238483 this is what he lives for this sort of high stakes politics this is what galvanizes him really gets him excited this is when hes at his best
9238484 youd rather have control of events yourself rather than waiting for other people to act
9238485 this allows harper to control the timing rather than sit passively and wait for dion to make up his mind

9238489 before the emergence of the political class the conventional mode of leadership was based on a vestigial idea of gentlemanly conduct the style had been laid down by the duke of wellington in the early 19th century both as a leader of men on the battlefield and later as prime minister and national icon it was based on understatement sobriety both in personal conduct and in speech self sacrifice restraint wellington eschewed displays of private emotion downplayed his personal achievements and showed a studied indifference to public opinion margaret thatcher in certain of her leadership techniques such as the use of methods and personnel drawn from commercial advertising marked a turning point her successor john major attempted to revert to an earlier style and was not successful tony blair however exchanged this old school of leadership for a political class methodology which favoured display self promotion knowingness and ostentation
9238490 the conventional mode of leadership was based on a vestigial idea of gentlemanly conduct it was based on understatement sobriety both in personal conduct and in speech self sacrifice restraint
9238491 the new calculus of higher gas prices may have permanently reshaped urban housing markets
9238492 what this really means is that as people move theyre going to look for places that enable them to drive shorter distances and avoid places where they have to drive a lot
9238493 i arrived at the store at 11am on friday the opening time announced on the stores website however by the time i entered the store almost all small sizes were gone what happened
9238494 with rising citizen expectations the advance of new technologies and a much sharper understanding of the impact of lifestyle choices the challenges that todays national health service faces are very different from those of 20 years ago i believe we can only meet these challenges by remaining true to the values of the nhs free at the point of use open to all rooted in the british belief in fairness and compassion but i also know that no modern health service can afford to stand still
9238495 im sure sir ara darzis a great knight and probably a wonderful doctor but hes spent his life in hospitals and primary care is a very different beast hes apparently going to tell gordon brown that the answer to improving access to primary care is to let boots virgin or tesco run the show
9238496 the entrepreneur who relaunched pizza express has been asked to run a chain of nhs cancer clinics luke johnson is in talks with one of britains leading cancer specialists to set up a string of cancer express centres that will offer patients every aspect of care from initial screening to chemotherapy
9238497 he led his company on a ride that left the rest of the industry gasping and wondering rather than collect his money from customers coming in off the street he went to the markets
9238498 the progressive decline of our traditional values of self restraint and self reliance the very core of a moral life

9238513 a technician had gone to an address on spinnaker drive for a service call to fix a womans internet
9238514 the technician had determined the internet connection was fine and that the problem was with the womans computer
9238515 she didnt like the answer and became very angry and agitated she told the technician in a tirade that he was not leaving until her internet was working and she told him she was keeping him hostage
9238516 she implied that she had a gun although he didnt see one
9238517 we went to the condo and arrested an extremely intoxicated woman without incident
9238518 it is an exciting coup for the great ocean road to be selected for tourism australias national landscapes program
9238519 to be selected as one of only eight destinations within australia is a compliment to the natural assets in the region and the wealth of product being offered by our operators along the entire stretch of the great ocean road
9238520 wait what happened what happened here and how is this happening without my consent
9238521 what did i do wrong why does it always end this way you said you loved me was that always a lie
9238522 this person is someone i want to see even after a miserably bad day

9238531 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9238532 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9238533 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9238534 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9238535 gov palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9238536 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9238537 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9238538 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9238539 we think it will be a choice between certainty and risk
9238540 love him or hate him our prime minister knows where he stands on the issues and will offer canadians certainty
9238541 were in rough waters and a steady hand at the wheel is what our economy needs
9238542 all of that is more risk and its more uncertainty around our economy
9238543 i think his plan is made he wants an election period
9238544 carter however focused heavily on mccain he said he was bewildered by mccains performance at the saddleback presidential forum hosted by pastor and author rick warren in lake forest calif earlier this month carter said that whether he was asked about religion domestic or foreign affairs every answer came back to mccains 5 years as a pow
9238545 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
9238546 let me tell you the reason i picked joe biden
9238547 instead of dwelling on specifics he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes that republicans mock
9238548 it hasnt changed my driving at all not a bit i just have to work harder
9238549 partly because of high gas prices here european cars are already far more efficient than those sold in the united states the average new european car gets 40 miles to the gallon double the average for new cars sold in america even so total carbon emissions from all forms of transportation in europe are rising they are about a quarter higher today than they were 20 years ago while emissions from industry have declined in the same period
9238550 rome ten dollars a gallon may seem unthinkable to american drivers still smarting from the spike in gas prices to around 4 a gallon but that was nearly the price that marco annarumi faced recently when filling his jeep on his way home from work
9238551 it hasnt changed my driving at all not a bit i just have to work harder
9238552 partly because of high gas prices here european cars are already far more efficient than those sold in the united states the average new european car gets 40 miles to the gallon double the average for new cars sold in america even so total carbon emissions from all forms of transportation in europe are rising they are about a quarter higher today than they were 20 years ago while emissions from industry have declined in the same period
9238553 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9238554 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9238555 good lord we had barely 12 hours of democrat optimism
9238556 it was a stunningly timed piece of pr by the republicans
9238557 i stayed up for days at the chelsea hotel writing sad eyed lady of the lowlands for you
9238558 i may be proven wrong but the decision announced by mccain strikes me as reckless she is not prepared to be the next president should something happen to mccain
9238559 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor of alaska was that she was not frank murkowski
9238560 i may be proven wrong but the decision announced by mccain strikes me as reckless she is not prepared to be the next president should something happen to mccain
9238561 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9238562 will americans want to watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis
9238563 leave policies women just leave and they dont come back
9238564 theyre in mourning but i think when they wake up the morning after and you compare the records between senater obama and senator mccain that they will come back to the democratic party and to senator obama
9238565 what do you think the most important advancement was for women in recent years
9238566 i firmly believe that if you help a woman then you educate a child you help the family
9238567 we do need the support and help of men to pass legislation it is still a male dominated body as we live in a male dominated culture so you do need men to help you
9238568 you shall worship the lord your god and him only you shall serve
9238569 you shall worship the lord your god and him only shall you serve
9238570 the animals in this exhibit are a wonderful collection of fascinating and somewhat creepy animals
9238571 visitors will be delighted by the wonderfully creative and interactive areas that showcase this wonderful animal collection
9238572 the animals in croaky creepy critters may make some people squirm but we think most will find them exciting and intriguing
9238573 the exhibit features a desert area which leads into a dark rainforest where you can stroll past giant mushrooms and peer inside giant tree trunks to view the animals
9238574 we also have zoo keepers on hand to inform visitors about the creatures and to offer some animal close encounters
9238575 sometimes the bigger or cuter media friendly animals steal the limelight but smaller animals and insects are equally important to biodiversity and the worlds future survival
9238576 an example is the outpouring of support for dolphins and whales but you wont see people waving banners to save plankton despite claims these organisms have been reduced by a third in recent years
9238577 the entire marine food chain relies on plankton the point is that we must protect all smaller species like frogs spiders lizards and insects if we are to protect all species including humans
9238578 we are warned by experts about a global extinction crisis and that 40 per cent of all the earths species are now at a high risk of extinction each creature ourselves included relies on another animal or plant to survive
9238579 that is why croaky creepy critters is so important it is a celebration of all animals not just the cute ones and it highlights the great importance of biodiversity
9238580 it is the dead not the living who make the longest demands we die forever
9238581 she came driving up to my house with a new car

9238587 we could call him 10 finger jon if he has metal fingers
9238588 having 10 fingers is normal so why would you make a whole name out of it
9238589 it is not normal to have 5 metal fingers and 5 normal fingers
9238590 but no one can tell from the name it isnt normal
9238591 well i dont know how bionic he really is but okay
9238592 you think the world is quite beautiful especially if you look at it in new and interesting ways you tend to focus on color and movement in art for you seeing the big picture is much more important than recording every little detail you can find inspiration anywhere especially from nature
9238593 i could spend the rest of my life working with those people i meet i could even make some kind of consulting coaching practice out of it but should i just because people invite me to do it does than mean i ought to
9238594 change in ones life does not require a career change in fact a career change should be last after lots of experimenting with small steps in an effort to find out who you really are thats how i found out again that im a writer
9238595 we are the same people we were last year at this time except for the books weve read the places weve traveled and the people weve met
9238596 its not important what happens to you its how you respond to what happens to you
9238597 art offers something else depth involvement a new way of looking at the world that we live in a fresh approach to what we take for granted a chance to experience freedom of the imagination
9238598 ive promised myself that if i ever seriously think of taking my life i will first go sit for at least a half an hour in front of monets water lilies i know that after 30 minutes i will leave with a reason to live
9238599 also we knowe that all thinges worke together for the best vnto them that loue god euen to them that are called of his purpose
9238600 i didnt even know who was going to be here we found out when someone in line was reading redeye and told us that olympians were going to be on the show
9238601 it certainly is creating some pressures in our emergency rooms
9238602 on monday aug 25 the iwk was contacted by its supplier armstrong foods to indicate that the halifax hospital had purchased a smoked meat product that was included on maple leafs expanded recall list
9238603 the smoked meat was distributed as a panini sandwich cafeteria special on aug 21st there were 19 panini specials sold however they were not part of patient food service or distributed to catering customers the recall of the panini smoked meat product does not necessarily mean that it contained any of the bacteria that cause listeriosis
9238604 capital health confirmed that three products listed on the canadian food inspection agencys expanded recall list issued aug 24 were purchased for use in some of capital healths restaurant menu items none of these items were used in patient meals please note that these products were identified as part of the expanded recall list as a precaution by maple leaf foods and have not been found to have listeria contamination
9238605 through our internal followup we have determined that one of the products added to the recall list as a precaution on aug 24 was served in the colchester regional hospital cafeteria prior to the recall
9238606 on july 30 a smoked meat on rye sandwich special containing coorsh pastrami was served in the cafeteria a total of 48 servings were prepared but not all were sold
9238607 a small amount of the pastrami was also included in the salad bar that day this product has not been directly linked to any of the confirmed cases of listeriosis was not served to in patients through our dietary service and has not been served in the cafeteria since july 30 all of the remaining product and other products included on the recall list have been disposed of

9238611 creating substance free shows because you think your audience has no attention span is a suckers game
9238612 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9238613 palin has more executive level decision making and governing experience in two years than obama and biden do combined
9238614 she saw something that she thought was wrong and she wanted to see it righted
9238615 democrats rejected a woman obama could have picked one but he bypassed hillary look what has happened for all the talk of a new kind of politics he chose biden
9238616 he told her she would be a terrific candidate and that he looked forward to seeing her on the campaign trail
9238617 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9238618 little known fact sarah palin doesnt need a gun to hunt she has been known to throw a bullet through an adult bull elk

9238621 if the history is written correctly herbert muhammad should go down as one of the greatest sports managers of all times
9238622 the name muhammad at a time when the name was mocked and scorned
9238623 sort of like a big brother because it was a crazy and turbulent time in the 60s and 70s when muhammad ali was in his prime
9238624 we will be able to pretty much lock down this city
9238625 people should be confident we will be able to handle this very very well we cant promise nothing will happen but it certainly will be a tremendous force of law enforcement and military here
9238626 nobody had to tell me twice to get out this time

9238650 you have this unique understanding for the most likely path action and response and deductive reasoning thats what scares some people but on the other its what makes you extremely capable in this business
9238651 the reason normal people got wives and kids hobbies whatever its because they aint got that one thing that hits them that hard and that true i got music you got this the thing you think about all the time the thing that keeps you south of normal yeah it makes us great it makes us the best all we miss out on is everything else no woman waitin at home after work with the drink and the kiss that aint gonna happen for us
9238652 you are a very unique individual where most peoples daily interactions with most people are just about the interaction itself yours are driven by a certain reality of your own mortality this is why you are incapable of playing the game why you cant project a false you and why you are frustrated with superficialities you dont think about it in a morbid way only that you deal with people with the subconscious understanding that life is short and all the fluff sparkles drama and glamour means nothing in the end you will be alone until you cross paths with someone else who sees the world with that same awareness you have
9238653 until you can see the world with your eyes closed feel with your heart instead of your hands listen without hearing a sound taste the world without taking a bite and smell the roses without taking a sniff you will never find what it means to be truly happy in life

9238678 and god saw that the wickedness of man was in the earth and that every imagination of the of his heart his mind was only continually
9238679 that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the emptiness their minds were devoid of truth of their having the darkened they are blind being alienated separated from the life of god they are dead having no real and right relationship with god through the that is in them because of the hardness of their heart
9238680 unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their and conscience is
9238681 it is the mind that is defiled and polluted by sin
9238682 sin has so twisted and perverted the intellect of the natural man and satan has so blinded his mind that he often thinks he knows more than god pride leads him to exalt his own mentality to such an extent that if god says anything which his tiny intellect and puny reason cannot comprehend then he declares gods saying foolishness he boldly proclaims gods sacred truth to be fable gods eternal word to be an earth born myth his endeavor to fathom gods ocean of truth with his little teacup of a mind is pathetic and his arrogant method of casting aside gods supernatural revelation when it goes contrary to his sin saturated reason is pitiful indeed
9238683 because the mind the fallen fleshly mind of man is enmity against god
9238684 every person that i have ever known has had a father and a mother there is not one man on earth that did not have a father and a mother at one time jesus was man therefore he must have had a father and a mother too he must have been a man like all other men that i know
9238685 the lord did not really walk on the water because that is impossible instead he was actually walking on a sandbar when peter got out of the boat he too stepped onto the sandbar but after a few steps he walked off the sandbar into the deeper water the lord had to reach out and pull him back up
9238686 the crowd of 5000 was not really fed from just five loaves and two fish because this is impossible it is impossible because my mind just cannot see how this could happen this is what really must have happened the crowd was very selfish they all had their lunches hidden away under their tunics when they saw the young lad share his lunch with the lord then they all felt ashamed that they had been so selfish and they began pulling out their lunches thus there was plenty of food for everyone and even much food that was left over
9238687 you god formed my inward parts you did weave me in my mothers womb i will give thanks to you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your works and my soul knows it very well my frame was not hidden from you when i was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth your eyes have seen my unformed substance and in your book they were all written the days that were ordained for me when as yet there was not one of them

9238698 we are taking the necessary steps to ensure the safety of louisianas pets
9238699 it is imperative that pet owners with critical transportation needs get to the parish pick up points as soon as possible
9238700 it will take time to register everyone and their pets and complete all the paperwork accurately
9238701 once you get your pet to a shelter you will be expected to provide care for your dogs and cats during your evacuation
9238702 lamar dixon and parker coliseum were tapped into service after katrina but will not be used as shelters during gustav

9238710 so why are my expectations of others so high what need in me is not being address of fulfilled in every community there is always someone who doesnt satisfy my need or someone who irritates me community is not some sentimental ideal place or time where everybody live together loves each other and always gets along that is never going to happen rather in living together we come to realize that community doesnt require or offer total emotional harmony in community you really come to know yourself jealously anger the feeling of being rejected or neglected the sense of not truly belonging all these emerged in the context of a community striving for a life of forgiveness reconciliation and healing sometimes in community i put claims on people that are so high that nobody can live up to them emotional claims and expectations of which i am not fully aware
9238711 entonces porqu las expectativas que tengo hacia los dem s son tan altas

9238720 in deep anguish and pain we the christian community of the delhi and national capital region submit this memorandum to you and not to the chief minister of orissa because we believe that by not stopping the ethnic cleansing of christians in orissa in the last six days he has abdicated his constitutional duties to the sangh parivar family of hindu extremist groups and thereby has forfeited his right to be in government

9238740 even to look at a temple is a sin for a musalman
9238741 during this month of ramzan 1080 a h january february 1670 the emperor the reviver of the faith of the prophet issued orders for the demolition of the dehra of keshava rai in mathura in a short time the destruction of this strong foundation of infidelity was accomplished and on its site a lofty mosque was built the idols large and small of the temple were brought to agra and buried under the steps of the mosque of begum sahib

9238745 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9238746 certainly wouldnt have backed projects like the bridge to nowhere
9238747 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer
9238748 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9238749 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened

9238771 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9238772 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9238773 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are

9238782 vlad isnt going to make it back on time is he
9238783 ive promised vlad that any complete draining of your blood if and when will be his doing im a vampire of my word
9238784 would vlad prefer me permanently dead or capable of resurrection whether the latter sees me returned as your minion or his
9238785 he was very emphatic when he warned me as my friend and my lover against my doing the deed
9238786 i emphasize very he and his family have plans for you that as far as i can determine dont include recruiting you into our life style which im not sure you would enjoy anyway there are so many things that can be done by those who can abide sunshine that cant be so easily accomplished by us permanently relegated to the shadows were i to deprive vlad of what he and his may expect from you and from yours in the daylight he wouldnt likely be pleased

9238789 hey if thats what you want all im saying is that i think youre giving up too much and getting back too little
9238790 neither would be eligible to be on the postseason roster making them kind of worthless for a contender that is almost certainly making the playoffs already
9238791 if i was the rockies i would do it instead of just letting fuentes walk
9238792 actually teams have until this monday to claim a player and have him be eligible for the postseason roster so actually in all reality fuentes is worth more than that because he can be a deciding factor between a world series contender and a world series winner if you actually had all your information correct you would have known that
9238793 if the rockies want to trade closer brian fuentes it will not be possible for them to do it before the september 1 deadline for setting postseason rosters

9238812 ancient beliefs say that the definition of dog is loyalty bravery prudent responsible humble and honesty which is what all of your characters portray in planet of the dogs
9238813 we also felt it was a good childrens book that adults would enjoy i bought it around christmas time and really loved it then i gave it to a friends 8 year old daughter who is dog crazy she read it almost in one day it has great lessons to be learned by all ages

9238821 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president

9238827 i have no excuses we were outplayed in every phase i give them full credit i do believe we made some crucial mistakes
9238828 this wont define us were better than that were going to come back stronger
9238829 we were on the ropes a bit in the first quarter but we responded all right after that
9238830 the way the first quarter went im really glad this whole deal worked out
9238831 hawaii displayed the better offense until the gators scored on a 1 yard run by brandon james with 11 39 in the second quarter
9238832 hawaii put up 102 yards on their first two drives 16 the rest of the first half
9238833 im very proud of our guys the future is pretty bright
9238834 big plays take the wind out of your sails can you expect that from us i dont know theres some guys that when they touch the ball and if you make a mistake they can score on you fun to watch
9238835 weve got some good lookin checkers to put on the checkerboard
9238836 we kind of love fast people around here and jeff demps is fast he is not a track athlete playing football he is a football player and chris rainey is a fantastic athlete
9238837 we kind of like fast people around here and demps is fast i dont know if you guys knew that but jeff demps can really run hes not a track guy playing football hes a football player
9238838 hes really good that is a good team and that was a great return against them
9238839 he made all 29 practices leading up to the game he got an iron gator t shirt from coach mick strength and conditioning coach mickey mariotti
9238840 when you create six turnovers good stuff is going on we have guys who love to play if you dont go hard youre in the minority now on defense
9238841 that was going to be his last snap at the university of florida if he didnt get it
9238842 that was his last snap at the university of florida if he didnt get the first down that was not called he saw a gap and he took it he will not do that again
9238843 just silly nonsense freshman penalties you have guys running into the kicker guys jumping offsides an offensive tackle moving most of it was on young players thats the biggest thing weve got to correct
9238844 im hoping but its going to be hard not to have tebow carry the ball at certain times in the game its all to take the wear and tear off of tim and not to lean on him too much but we all know at the end of the day no 15 will carry the mail for us in critical situations
9238845 its going to be hard not to have 15 carry the ball itd be nice to be able to do what we did with cam in that situation you saw on the goal line earlier in the game where we went to three backs a full house backfield were going to try not to lean on him so much but we all know at the end of the day 15 will carry the ball in certain situations
9238846 everything went so slow at the beginning we were saying lets go lets go i think were just used to having it so fast in practice
9238847 it was a good effort from everyone today offensively the running backs ran well and we spread the ball around effectively everyone was part of the win
9238848 weve got a lot of weapons a key for us today was getting out there and using all those weapons
9238849 we spread the ball around everybody was a part of the win
9238850 tim tebow didnt have a rushing touchdown for the first time since 2006 but the gators got a rushing touchdown from four different players in the win
9238851 aw shucks im not too worried about that right now
9238852 its more about winning an sec title and a national championship
9238853 in games like this maybe but well see in big time situations who we can trust with the ball
9238854 im excited about playing the u ive never done it before
9238855 its definitely nice sometimes i didnt take too much of a pounding i think i only have one bruise
9238856 in certain situations im still going to be myself but im going to try to be smarter if i dont have to do too much im not going to
9238857 like third and 1 in a tight game on saturday he ran only six times although one of them was as pretty a run as weve seen tebow reversed his field and just stepped out at the 1 but on the next play the ball went to brandon james for the score because this was hawaii
9238858 it was nice i got a lot of rest on the bench im not used to the defense was beating us in points there for a while it was a good thing to see
9238859 it feels good we have a little thing coach says in practice you put the money in the bank in games you get to take it out today was payday for us i knew we were going to come out do some big stuff i just got paid today
9238860 i didnt expect to do that in my first game my goal was to come out here and play some and have some fun
9238861 it was awesome i heard the whole crowd in the swamp cheering it was a good feeling it was kind of sweet making those plays it felt like old times at lakeland high
9238862 the first thing i wanted to do was get the ball once i got it i saw i had a little space and the defense did a good job at picking up blocks i just followed them
9238863 it deflates them when i got the second one for a touchdown that deflated them our secondary played well
9238864 we had a couple of penalties the score was 0 0 and they were driving i got the interception and we scored it was kind of a gamebreaker
9238865 when d mo went out i knew i had to step up i had to step up and not be the weak link
9238866 i didnt get much playing time at corner last year i only played like two games i like the safety position where i see more field
9238867 yeah it was kind of tough watching the older guys was good now i look at the younger guys and know what theyre going through
9238868 all weve been trying to do is get better everyone knows we were the weakness last year we just want to get better
9238869 we cant get a big head weve got to keep going
9238870 he didnt look receiver off as much as we expected coach told us that he was going to look wherever he would throw and he did
9238871 im kinda showing everybody that i can play even with my size coach meyer is pushing me im just trying to do well on the field
9238872 oh i get it its a big game coach said college gameday will be here its a night game and its in the swamp
9238873 hes been playing like hes been out there for two years thats what he does he makes plays
9238874 we had good blocking by our corners they did a good job holding up the gunners
9238875 i feel pretty good when i have broken a couple of tackles once i get in the open field and turn the corner i feel like ive got a chance
9238876 it comes out on film if 10 guys are running hard on a play the guy who isnt is going to hear about it from everyone
9238877 florida fakes a punt and even punter chas henry is able to outrun hawaiis defense in fact henry seems to be pulling away from hawaii defenders as he hits the sideline there is some discussion in the press box as to whether western carolina would be able to beat hawaii

9238884 because if i stopped eating meat which would take significant effort because i love my meat im not convinced it would make a difference slaughterhouses would still exist and animals would still be treated in those ways there are billions of meat eaters in the world supporting the factory farming industry and i dont believe one person giving up meat will make any difference in the grand scheme of things

9238892 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something im running to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things im running for president to protect our country from harm and defeat its enemies im running for president to make the government do its job not your job im not running to leave our biggest problems to an unluckier generation of leaders but to fix them now and fix them well

9238896 forcing animals to mutilate each other for the sake of gambling money and a sick sense of entertainment is animal cruelty at its worst
9238897 its time for ohio law to assign meaningful punishment to these criminals
9238898 be the change that you want to see in the world
9238899 all beings tremble before violence all fear death all love life see yourself in others then whom can you hurt
9238900 i dont have any understanding of a human being who doesnt respect the beauty of life and that goes for all creatures that have thoughts feelings and needs
9238901 to be a vegetarian is to disagree to disagree with the course of things today starvation world hunger cruelty waste wars we must make a statement against these things vegetarianism is my statement and i think its a strong one
9238902 i tremble for my species when i reflect that god is just
9238903 until we have the courage to recognize cruelty for what it is whether its victim is human or animal we cannot expect things to be much better in this world we cannot have peace among men whose hearts delight in killing any living creature
9238904 you have just dined and however scrupulously the slaughterhouse is concealed in the graceful distance of miles there is complicity
9238905 there will be no justice as long as man will stand with a knife or with a gun and destroy those who are weaher than he is
9238906 you have just dined and however scrupulously the slaughterhouse is concealed in the graceful distance of miles there is complicity
9238907 this is definitely the biggest vegan oriented news of the year and quite possibly the decade
9238908 the cattlemen and dairy folks must be crapping their knickers right about now
9238909 so this first day wasnt hard at all for breakfast i had steel cut oatmeal with fresh blueberries strawberries chopped walnuts and a splash of soy milk and some agave nectar for lunch chunky mushroom soup with wild rice and pecans as a snack a handful of roasted almonds and for dinner a baked potato drizzled with olive oil salt and pepper with a salad of shredded lettuce cranberries pine nuts and tiny orange slices with a vinegar and oil dressing
9238910 you do something i dont agree with so youre weird oh by the way change your habits to be this way
9238911 how can you say youre trying to spiritually evolve without even a thought about what happens to the animals whose lives are sacrificed in the name of gluttony so this 21 day cleanse gives me a chance to think about it differently and see what my attachments are to certain kinds of foods and what im willing to do to change
9238912 how can you say youre trying to spiritually evolve without even a thought about what happens to the animals whose lives are sacrificed in the name of gluttony so this 21 day cleanse gives me a chance to think about it differently and see what my attachments are to certain kinds of foods and what im willing to do to change
9238913 move over milk your century in the spotlight is over you are gross hormone y and meant for baby cows
9238914 did you know humans are the only species to drink milk past babyhood and moreover to drink the milk of another species
9238915 christian morality interesting that in those cases the ideals were often opposed violently by the ruling faction yet they were embraced by the people without any attack on the ruling faction the ideas stood for themselves
9238916 ive said at least once that i support a person bettering herself
9238917 im not vegan because im not convinced that use of animals is immoral
9238918 if searing chickens beaks castrating without anesthetics and forced starvation are not immoral in you opinion then what is
9238919 virtually all the chicken sold in america more than 99 according to bill roenigk vice president of the national chicken council comes from factory farm production
9238920 in the united states 98 percent of eggs are still from caged hens and as we shall see of the remaining 2 percent very few of these are truly free range
9238921 while an estimated seven hundred and fifty million people go to bed hungry every night a third of the worlds grain is fed to farm animals the typical western meat based diet can only feed two and a half billion people but a plant based diet will feed everyone on the planet
9238922 when a mans love of finery clouds his moral judgment that is vanity when he lets a demanding palate make his moral choices that is gluttony when he ascribes the divine will to his own whims that is pride and when he gets angry at being reminded of animal suffering that his own daily choices might help avoid that is moral cowardice
9238923 but vegan philosophy as i understand it opposes any use of animals not just the cruel use
9238924 they spread their higher ideals without insults or satire or any other petty means
9238925 you do not have to agree with this correct argument to be vegan john you simply have to have the courage of your convictions
9238926 part of the mandate for myself was that i wanted to have a local theater company in residence were going to have a new company every year we were looking for a company without a permanent home one that was doing really interesting work and was ready for taking the next step vis vis what we could give them
9238927 the day i got here i started looking through the papers and the publicity to see what i should be seeing
9238928 underneath the issue of the nose its transferred to race and some other issues come out around how the characters limit themselves based on identity the main character who is korean chooses to write letters for his friend who is caucasian because he thinks this korean american woman likes only white guys
9238929 there are two volunteers helping him a caucasian chicago socialite and the deacon at a black catholic church they live in different americas which one does he get settled into and how does his identity factor into that
9238930 i think we had ten theaters apply for the first year and they were really strong applications all ten basically made the case for why they were ready for attention and how they would use our resources to create exciting theater moolelo made a great case but honestly if no new companies applied i could do the next eight years with what ive already got
9238931 kristen brandt the former artistic director at the sledgehammer theatre mailed me the script in november of 2006
9238932 she said this looks like something that might fit for moolelo
9238933 one of our audience members came up after a performance and said have you ever considered a play that deals with brain injury
9238934 they liked it they thought it really captured what aphasia was about
9238935 in a unique moment of art imitating life or rather life guiding art joe hiel husband of board member elaine hiel who had been patiently reading the paper perked up he pulled out the san diego union tribune which featured a front page article about soldiers returning from iraq with brain injury joe whose stroke in 1981 rendered him aphasic pointed to the news article referenced the play and said this is me the decision was made
9238936 weve been reaching out to the brain injured community it isnt just hey buy a ticket to see a show about people like you its to encourage the community to be a partner to take ownership of the project and its because we need the community to even do it im going to play the character with aphasia but i knew nothing about it so i needed dramaturgical support from the brain injured community
9238937 don strom survived a brain aneurysm in 1992 that rendered him aphasic
9238938 navigated through the journey of brain injury recovery and aphasia a journey which changed them both but which they did together they are a model for how a couple can face a crisis and not only survive but grow thanks to jane and don im starting to crystallize some ideas about anna
9238939 we spend a majority of our time fundraising and writing donation letters our ticket revenues cover only about 30 percent of the cost of each show and we offer free tickets to community groups based on need
9238940 with the returning iraq war vets who have suffered traumatic brain injuries i think its crucial for the san diego community to become more aware about these things how do we support brain injury survivors of all kinds i dont see theater as being this exclusive thing that lives out on the side of things i think theater is most effective when it is central to the civic dialogue i spent a lot of time in the middle east and i was speaking with an israeli playwright there this was during my formative years in college he said that theater should be the temples the mosques the synagogues the churches of our lifetime where people can really grapple with issues theater should be a place where people come and have dialogue and leave having heard something a perspective that maybe they have not heard before but they should also leave feeling reflected on stage the hallmark of moolelo is specifically that making a show that has multiple perspectives and using it to create community dialogue bringing in communities who would not typically sit in the same room together fostering bridges there can be work done beyond the show
9238941 we cannot live in a world which sees people as just labels
9238942 well we can but its ultimately dangerous and unproductive when i was writing remains i workshopped it with both the local jewish community and the local palestinians and i talked with some christian arab communities when we did a piece of my heart we partnered with the veterans museum and used their venue for the play after doing remains our database was all social activists we wanted to have a dialogue about vietnam and about the current conflict after the play we had conversations that really broke down bridges we had social activists talking with the daughter of a vietnam veteran they didnt see each other as opposites but as humans they might seem like small things but for the individuals they are huge
9238943 if you give it up youre cheaper and you dont get health insurance and that sort of thing
9238944 the playhouse is demonstrating that you can be a major national force on the theater scene a theater that artists from all over the world are dying to work at and at the same time you can nourish the community in which you live i think the theater residency demonstrates that
9238945 in the past five six seven years there have been a number of small companies like moolelo that have been able to launch and survive that speaks volumes

9238954 it was one area of the environment that i thought i could make an immediate impact
9238955 the devil is an iconic australian animal particularly in tasmania so i have a personal interest in how fragile the environment is and the need to preserve the uniqueness of the wildlife so that another animal does not become extinct

9239071 no existe disposici n en la constituci n que expresamente reconozca la libertad de la mujer para decidir sobre su cuerpo no desconozco ese derecho pero no tiene rango constitucional
9239072 yo no me pronuncio porque si empez la vida cu ndo si esto es bueno si esto es malo si esto se comprob si no se comprob yo simplemente me pronuncio porque esto no es un tema de constitucionalidad
9239073 por qu penalizar si estamos de acuerdo en que el aborto es un problema de tal magnitud y complejidad que nos rebasa como sociedad para qu encarcelar a las mujeres una manera eficaz de ayudar a las mujeres que abortan y dar una soluci n a ese problema social es despenalizar el aborto legislarlo sacarlo de la clandestinidad las mujeres no abortan por maldad ni delincuencia sino por desesperaci n
9239074 el dictamen aprueba y avala que el estado mexicano obligue a las mujeres embarazadas a convertirse en madres bajo la amenaza y control penal generando la posibilidad de que si toma la decisi n de no ser madre se le atribuya la categor a de delincuente
9239075 independientemente de cual sea mi opini n personal respecto a la reforma debo manifestar que no encontr ning n motivo de inconstitucionalidad y creo que se trata de una despenalizaci n que no infringe ninguna regla ni valores que establece la constituci n porque ninguna regla obliga al legislador a penalizar conductas de particulares
9239076 ni en la legislaci n nacional o en los tratados internacionales existe una norma que obligue al estado mexicano a sancionar penalmente a la mujer que decide interrumpir su embarazo en las primeras 12 semanas de gestaci n
9239077 el legislador cuenta con la potestad suficiente para despenalizar aquellas conductas que han dejado de tener a juicio del legislador democr tico un reproche social
9239078 corresponde a esta suprema corte convalidar ese ejercicio democr tico y social en tanto cuenta con sustento constitucional suficiente y propicio para ello en cierta manera reconocen que el estado ha sido incapaz de mitigar las situaciones de desigualdad imperantes en nuestra sociedad reflejadas en la pobreza marginaci n e ignorancia en las que todav a se encuentran inmersas un gran n mero de mujeres
9239079 si la madre de cada uno de nosotros hubiera decidido que se interrumpiera el embarazo de lo que fue nuestro origen no habr amos seguido viviendo
9239080 sostener que constitucionalmente la protecci n a la vida en gestaci n es absoluta llevar a a violentar los derechos fundamentales de la mujer reconocidos por la propia carta fundamental consider ndola un mero instrumento reproductivo

9239131 is what we are witnessing the promised land king saw
9239132 when you go into your first game of the year and youre in the situation were in from the standpoint of our placekicker there isnt any question that in the back of your mind is the fact this is a veteran
9239133 thats really the number one thing john carney has so much experience and been in this league for so long kicked so many game winning field goals and been in so many tight situations its very difficult to overlook that part of it especially when youre week to week with your present kicker a guy thats kicked a 47 yarder to put you in the super bowl
9239134 theyre veteran players and theyve seen an awful lot in this game and theyve been able to react to it each individual is different
9239135 from the standpoint of reuben we have a pretty good group of guys at running back and felt like they were all worthy of making an nfl team and they have so many roles that they can play
9239136 reuben can be a fullback he can be a running back he can be a special teams player he can be a short yardage and goal line guy he has a lot of hats he can wear
9239137 i think most of the time if you go back and look the roster turnover is in that area around 25 percent
9239138 there is always change in some way shape or form the other thing is youre always in a position where youre trying to develop your young guys to come along thats always a factor youre counting on the veteran experience from the offensive side of the ball and hoping the new guys can become integrated as fast as possible to the sophistication to the in season play you just hope people can come together as fast as possible to make the kind of plays that are necessary to win

9239185 we plan to change the concept from convenience store lotto tobacco malt liquor etc which we will not offer to a neighborhood market offering fresh produce and espresso with a casual family environment we will offer a limited dine in menu emphasizing comfort foods and high quality fresh goods we are currently facing a huge remodel but we are energetic and hopeful to be opening in late october we would love to hear your thoughts as our new ballard neighbors what do you want to see on our shelves

9239187 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9239188 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9239189 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9239190 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9239191 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
9239192 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
9239193 the healthy user effect is everywhere you dont want it to be
9239194 im afraid chris that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it ive been talking to governors jindal barbour reilly crist ive been talking to all of them but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9239195 i dont think that is a possibility to postpone a convention is much more difficult than you might think
9239196 i am not sure that would be the preferred method i do believe there are other methods to deal with that potential situation so that we recognize and show the gravity of the situation and still do our business
9239197 we want people to be worried about their personal safety

9239208 barack obama john mccain have each had one major task of their judgment john mccain chose someone who was a mayor of a town of 7 000 people then was elected governor has been governor of a state for 18 months governor of a state thats half the population of franklin county
9239209 and yet shes gonna be a heartbeat away from the president
9239210 no way is right now on the other hand in his first exercise of good judgment barack obama chose joe biden
9239211 i dont get a sense that the addition of this vice presidential choice is gonna change the fact that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction

9239215 it might have helped teams in some areas we all like getting free kicks
9239216 people will say were whingeing that were blaming the umpires but theyve been ordinary to us all year
9239217 they need to hold the whistle and let the game go or at least call the free kicks at both ends of the ground instead of just for one team
9239218 the only thing that were focused on is the next four or five weeks
9239219 im really surprised we got that few free kicks and im shocked that there is such a difference with geelong

9239230 you gave me the blinkies and im mad at you
9239231 oh come on how can you not laugh at the irony of this
9239232 you know youre right but heres something to think about are those your kids in the car seats of your prius over there
9239233 yes of course they are i suppose you have a problem with kids too or that i drive a hybrid
9239234 not it the least but heres something to think about this sign has had the shit mangled out of it by someone who clearly is lacking in driving skills how well do you think your prius would hold up if the person driving whatever mashmobile they were in had plowed into the side of your little prius with your kids in it would you still feel as compassionate towards those who are less skilled behind the wheel if this sign had the hell beaten out of it like this by a driver who likely did it at less than 5 miles an hour what do you think would happen if they were on 520 and displayed these kinds of skills
9239235 oh im fine but youre absolutely right im going to go get the store manager to pull the security tape and report that mongo and have his license revoked

9239371 when is a subtitled film not a foreign language film when its the first gaelic feature to be made specifically for the cinema and seachd does indeed look fantastic on the big screen new zealand only wishes it looked this good in lord of the rings visiting his dying grandfather angus coll macdonald flashes back to his childhood the death of his parents on a mountaineering trip and the old mans endless store of rich mythical folktales these timeless stories of poisoned lovers magical flowers and water horses seem to come out of the misty landscapes of scotland itself as angus makes discoveries the film continually surprises us with the range of its imagination and a unique structure that owes more to our oral storytelling tradition than hollywood scriptwriting sessions
9239372 the stories within the story prove you dont need megabuck special effects to open eyes to wonder and beauty especially if you have the good fortune to be shooting on the isle of skye
9239373 the skill of the filmmakers matches their ambition resulting in a visually arresting and poetic work that will have a cross generational appeal
9239374 it is a wonderful warm and personal story with some superb performances and i hope there are many more of these films to come from scotland
9239375 scottish heritage gets a boost in seachd the inaccessible peak but more than that its a poignant ode to storytelling
9239376 admirable intentions and deep pride in skyes culture of storytelling are at the heart of this well rounded debut the first contemporary film in scots gaelic
9239377 seachd combines myth making and fantasy with a real sense of grit and pragmatism thats very scottish to me the wildest flights of fancy presented in a sort of down to earth straight faced manner
9239378 its pretty amazing that theres never been a scottish gaelic film before but its great that the first one is creating such buzz
9239379 in the islands language is the passport to almost a hidden world
9239380 en este momento estoy muy dolida siento una pena enorme ten a la ilusi n de estar en uno de los mejores torneos del mundo pero el ipd me cerr esa posibilidad aduciendo que a ellos tambi n les hab an reducido el presupuesto

9239392 a superb film filled with tons of passion and pride
9239393 i was like this when the director and the producer came to tell me about the film
9239394 the director told me the whole story while i was up in the tree
9239395 we went to every school we could find then we heard about this boy when we got there i was sold in five seconds he was in the tree the whole time and we talked about the script and he challenged parts of it and said what he thought might happen he was totally unfazed exactly the kind of kid you need
9239396 for me the question is not why make a film in gaelic but why not make a film in gaelic
9239397 it seemed strange that a culture so full of storytelling didnt particularly have a tradition of cinema i have never been to a cinema to see a film in gaelic there is plenty of gaelic drama but it does seem to have suffered from stereotype it tends to have been period works there is a feeling that gaelic is old fashioned i wanted to tackle that head on
9239398 film is the kind of thing that if you get it right it does not matter what language it is in
9239399 mel gibson has proved that more than anyone in recent years you dont have to know the language to experience the film
9239400 the jury has decided not to put any films forward
9239401 im afraid im not at liberty to discuss the contents of the jurys discussion because its confidential
9239402 im gobsmacked i just assumed that there was a better film in their opinion im gobsmacked that they just said oh no we dont like your film and were not putting anything forward i think thats a bit weird
9239403 seachd is an excellent film which deserves to reach the widest possible audience
9239404 we have supported the film through its development and production and we are obviously disappointed and puzzled that it wont have a chance to compete for an oscar
9239405 we think the film has delivered and it also tried some innovative things by bringing along new gaelic talent in the writing and directing areas
9239406 its short sighted of bafta not to make any nomination whether it was the welsh or gaelic film i think its bad news for minority languages when they make decisions like that
9239407 seachd is a literate captivating success just the thing for anyone who loves a good story
9239408 bafta is there to support british film not only are they not supporting a british film and a british film producer but they are actively putting obstacles in our path
9239409 what actually is the benefit of being a member of bafta i have decided to quit
9239410 i do not understand why they would refuse to submit the film
9239411 i have never known a country refuse to submit a film
9239412 the merit of a films worthiness is totally subjective and the experts are continually making grave errors of judgment about movies therefore it would seem only logical for bafta to have chosen one of the films to represent the fact that britain is a multi language country
9239413 what i dont understand is why bafta scotland did not take a more proactive position on this this is an issue not just for the producer but for scotland in the future perhaps the choice should be left to scotland and wales and not bafta in london
9239414 i think this is an issue that should be raised with the department of sports and culture and the minister for film there is a scottish parliament dont they have any interest in these issues
9239415 wales and ireland have a huge culture where their minority language is concerned but scotland needs to keep pushing its a shame
9239416 this is a decision that i have inherited ive just literally stepped into the chair of film we totally understand the concern and im dealing with it
9239417 there was a great deal of discussion but it was a majority decision
9239418 i am unable to add anything more because of the bafta code of confidentiality
9239419 i feel i have been treated with total disrespect as has the film theyve made my life hell for the past two weeks im trying to shoot a comedy at the moment and ive spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to get a decision and get an explanation for the decision
9239420 its certainly something i would like to talk to alex salmond about
9239421 ive never dealt with the oscars im a branch of bafta uk

9239434 you feel for anyone that goes down and especially when it looks like a leg injury at first you think oh is it a knee and then is it an ankle and from what i gather without getting medical into it its more of a foot thing and x rays were negative and those kinds of things but absolutely your heart jumps
9239435 i spoke to beanie and he said it was just his big toe and he said hes going to be fine
9239436 when i went out there to check on him i told him to relax and take a breath i was crushed to see that kind of player go down but i have a lot of confidence that he will be back hes one of those guys who is hungry and wants to play
9239437 we dont want to see anybody down and especially beanie in the offseason he worked really hard im sure he will be back at first you always think the worst but we have the best training staff in the nation im sure they will have him ready to go

9239445 i hope he doesnt its obviously up to him ultimately to decide what he will do but i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duties
9239446 my interest is in having the best possible team for the liberal party to contest the next election and plainly peter costello is a very superior political talent and id like him to be part of that team
9239447 should the liberal party determine that mr costello should become the leader id relish the opportunity each and every day to remind the australian public hes the architect of workchoices
9239448 we could see flooding that is worse than what we saw with katrina
9239449 this storm could be as bad as it gets when it comes to the effect on the louisiana coast
9239450 we are open to the idea of a joint investigation
9239451 it is important that we all get to the bottom of what has happened
9239452 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9239453 coming from the national hurricane centre this could be as bad as it gets
9239454 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9239455 i think shes playing really well and im glad she feels like shes playing her best its nice to feel like when youre playing your best
9239456 right now im not playing my best but that means i can do so much better
9239457 no i dont think id have as many because she motivated me especially being young and watching her play
9239458 i was able to see the mistakes she made so when i actually played i didnt make the mistakes that she made
9239459 also she motivates me when she became number one i suddenly got motivated to be there too if anything i think she definitely helped my career

9239470 there is nothing false about hope followed by the recorded voice of mlk giving his
9239471 our country should be proud of itself today thats all i have to say
9239472 my community i dont know how we could withstand another storm
9239473 the first thing i thought was someone needs to give george bush a history lesson on the berlin airlift they could have gotten food and water to people
9239474 and they called us refugees were not refugees were evacuees we give our sweat and blood to build these communities where we live when they called us refugees that was an insult
9239475 his campaign inspires me and many of the young people i taught who are now adults
9239476 my students in eight universities volunteered in the rebuilding of the 9th ward they are out there and they are involved they felt this urgent need to do community service
9239477 i think its going to be a surprise to the nation how young people are going to unite theyre out there for barack im proud of them theyre our leaders theyre leading us
9239478 im thinking what a great time were having and what a great time were going to have
9239479 this is my seventh convention and this is the greatest one history is being made
9239480 he always talks too long one bad election and he goes on and on blah blah blah
9239481 i look at it like are we reaching the right groups we need to reach to win and how do we get to that
9239482 we need to win right now we dont have time to be in a cult of personality its about the hard work its about stating our position and getting to people we havent reached yet
9239483 im of a generation where you dont like to talk about these things
9239484 for 25 years i had a good paying factory job with all the benefits
9239485 in 2004 days after the election my job was eliminated at that time im 60 years old nobody is going to hire a 60 year old at a good paying job

9239487 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9239488 at no moment did spanair indicate that it was its intention to substitute the plane
9239489 informed the airport of the possibility of replacing the aircraft but eventually decided to stick with the aircraft that crashed
9239490 after an initial evaluation of the detected glitch and the estimated time for its repair maintenance technicians decided that it would not be necessary to switch planes as it was a minor repair that would take no more than 15 minutes
9239491 some people even propose that the virus is good for bats
9239492 said delegate cathie adams republican national committeewoman elect and president of the texas eagle forum
9239493 i think hillary clintons campaign stimulated a lot of interest among women voters and i think this is going to hit a chord
9239494 thought he needed to satisfy that wing of the party
9239495 the incarnation was not contingent upon a human willing in christ if you will
9239496 but in all eastern orthodox theology because of its refusal to admit a completely gratuitous election ultimately abraham was saved because he willed it and gods help was contingent upon his
9239497 you know your writings on free choice and mans self determination limit the sovereignty of god i just dont think it covers some verses which give me trouble
9239498 the bible says essau have i hated see there god hates people he wants to hate
9239499 we certainly do think his wrath is soothed by the pleasing sacrifice of christ
9239500 because you want to fuck me and im gonna give you the chance
9239501 uh uh not like that honey you want to fuck me youve got to take a chance to get it i want to fuck right now on the hood of this car in front of all this traffic

9239503 what theyre saying is that within a couple of days theyll know after hes taken the soup whether or not he has to take this operation
9239504 we are not yet where we want to be but thats what we expect from the team
9239505 we are 60 to 70 per cent of the way to where we want to be but the players believe in where we are going
9239506 the reality of this industry is that someone has to be the bottom side in the tri nations but that doesnt mean theyre a bad side
9239507 it was a great win a good performance by the springboks
9239508 they got in the game and built some momentum while we dropped off
9239509 gustav has continued to strengthen and now has maximum winds near 230 kilometres per hour
9239510 were hoping that its going to settle down enough that we can do some damage assessment
9239511 im expecting the hms iron duke early and theyre going to be providing significant assistance in our damage assessment operations
9239512 it is all wet and i am afraid to sleep inside there
9239513 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can take only a few weeks off work
9239514 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in child care at six weeks i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth
9239515 and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9239516 we may have to look at that situation and try and monitor
9239517 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9239518 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9239519 if a governor decides to stay home then we will make changes to the schedule but as of today there are no changes
9239520 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9239521 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9239522 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9239523 the opening of rafah for a few days will alleviate the suffering of our people
9239524 no one no institution and no union will be allowed to sabotage the security of gazas citizens
9239525 you know i think i have all this boy girl thing figured out you know why the girls in our class dont pay any attention to us i also have an idea as to how it will play out too and my friend i have something else that is really hot for us to work on
9239526 really old great sahib fill me in on your wondrous observations
9239527 have you noticed what grade the guys are in that the best looking girls of our class are dating
9239528 well have you ill tell you every last one of the nice looking freshman girls are dating either a junior or senior guy
9239529 the way that i have got this figured is that the attraction of the older guys is that they have cars and move with the older crowd who have the best parties
9239530 sort of here is the plan we keep a book listing each good looking girl in school freshmen sophomore and junior each girl will have a page on which we will record the name of the guys that she dates also who and how long she goes steady with one girls that we have an interest in we try to sit near when they go to the movies to try to determine just how intimate they are with each guy anything we learn about a girl goes into the book by their senior year the guys that they are dating will have graduated gone away to college
9239531 dont you see a girl who has been really getting it on with a steady guy will suddenly have no steady or anyone for that matter to take her to the dances or parties
9239532 fuck you get serious how many dates have you had in the last month none right
9239533 you got me there go ahead with your words of wisdom
9239534 okay first when we are sophomores we ask out the dateless senior girls that went steady for a couple years if they will date us even if their only motive is to have a warm body to escort them to a party or dance we will be with a girl who has done a lot of heavy petting and is used to drinking with the older crowd failing that we try the junior girls in the same fix
9239535 speaking of ellen her brother told me that her boyfriend troy burton has a full football scholarship at south carolina so next fall she will be available with luck for some kissy facing
9239536 sounds good we will see how it works out it is going to be a long year until then what is the other hot project
9239537 have you ever taken a good look at mrs bowerman the lady who lives next door to me in the yellow house
9239538 i know a secret about her i heard my folks talking a couple nights ago mrs bowerman is a drunk you know an alcoholic dad was telling mom that he heard that she made a fool of herself at a frat party that she and her husband were supposed to be the chaperones of according to dad her husband took her home when he found her in a hallway with two guys who were taking liberties with her
9239539 i clean her yard the other day when i was talking to her just before ten am i could smell whiskey on her breath she had a robe on she did not notice that it was part way open i could see most of her tits her husband mr bowerman is the regional manager for an insurance company he is away every other week that is why they have me take care of the yard as well as clean their pool with my drivers license i can offer to take her shopping or wherever she needs to go
9239540 what the hell are you talking about why doesnt she drive herself
9239541 i used to ask myself the same thing until mom and dad mentioned it the other night
9239542 her drinking explains why she does not drive her car anymore she must be afraid of being picked up for dwi
9239543 you can see the side of her tits plus some pussy hair
9239544 just your average lady bleached blonde with nice legs how old is this babe
9239545 i check to see if she is out on the sunny hot days hey notice the milk glass filled with her drink if that is booze it is a lot
9239546 its booze i can see the bottle as well as a small ice chest under her lounge
9239547 how many of these cocks have been in a real live pussy
9239548 see this pretty cockee righty here this baby gets used a lot in a nice warm pussy let me tell you hmm hmm hmm hmm
9239549 i love to dance i would love to teach you
9239550 oh great i feel like such a dunce at the dances now
9239551 oh art you are such a good guy the girls will be all over you when you get older
9239552 me get over here right away i will leave the front door open folks are out come up to the attic something to see hurry
9239553 be right back keep your eyes on the pool area
9239554 art could you drive me over to centerville arbors just past the centerville dam i want to buy some flowers to plant around the house
9239555 love to my folks have gone to raleigh to visit my relatives how about stopping at the deli on the way after you buy your flowers we could stop at welder state park i know a neat place in the ledges over the lake to have a picnic
9239556 so young man do you think that it is proper for a married woman to picnic in a secluded place with a much younger single guy like your self
9239557 it all depends on what the woman wants to do with the young man and where does she want it to happen dont you think
9239558 and just what do you think a married woman might want to happen if she was with a young guy such as yourself
9239559 you clean up in the bathroom down the hall ill shower in here drive me to centerville after i buy my flowers we can stop at the deli and then have a picnic that will be fun
9239560 this is more of what you had in mind isnt it
9239561 art honey go very very slow feel how nice your cock feels as it slips in and out of me do it real real slow
9239562 im sure that she will fuck you too if we set it up right
9239563 if your going to fucky fucky me you have to eat me first
9239564 it seems that your friend marky is here isnt he you boys planning on jenny doing you both huh ill just have to think about that
9239565 you dont know what to expect when members attend and trying to do the best and helping the injured people to actually take one of the vehicles thats protecting the scene
9239566 youre sandrine a sandrine from ji b i discussions model filmography 1972 people someday holt encyclopedia in black born beautiful
9239567 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9239568 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9239569 contains information of the kind mentioned in the der spiegel story
9239570 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9239571 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9239572 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9239573 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9239574 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9239575 it is my duty as a head of government to express to you in the name of the italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused you
9239576 the accord will provide for 200 million a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9239577 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9239578 this is an historic moment when two brave men acknowledge the defeat of colonialism
9239579 the libyan people endured injustice and were attacked in their homes and they deserve an apology and compensation
9239580 oh no this is just to get you ready are you ready now
9239581 but you dont get it yet its for later right now i want you to fuck me
9239582 id like it better if that cock was in my ass

9239592 shut up and take it like the bitch that you are
9239593 to call a possum an opossum outside of a scientific treatise is an affectation
9239594 why two of those mischievous little scamps at our old place used to positively gorge themselves on guavas from the trees out back of a summer evening
9239595 theres only one thing to serve possum with sweet potatoes
9239596 consideramos que es insuficiente porque se mantiene la famosa tablita de machinea porque es injusto ese impuesto
9239597 se le descuenta para el m nimo no imponible pero no se toma en cuenta para el aguinaldo
9239598 es una distorsi n porque el aumento se lo lleva la afip esto es lo que le venimos planteando al gobierno desde hace tiempo y esperamos que de una vez por todas se deje sin efecto esto se debe estudiar y eliminar
9239599 esperamos que en las reuniones con el gobierno podamos discutir este tema nosotros hemos ratificado la necesidad de eliminar esa tablita
9239600 este tema no lo podemos estar discutiendo todos los a os el gobierno deber a no introducirlo en la ley de presupuesto 2009 para evitar discutir otra vez este tema
9239601 no es justo que a un trabajador que gana 1 500 pesos le paguen 100 pesos de asignaci n y al que al que gana 1501 pesos le paguen 75 pesos

9239614 you have no idea how much ive been thinking about you ive been dying to do that since sunday
9239615 damn i cant believe i just did that i have no idea who was watching us just now
9239616 oh yes sweetie im sure we can find some time together very soon right now im waiting for my room mate cheryl she should be along in a few minutes she said she needed to meet me right away it sounded urgent
9239617 but maybe after lunch we could find some time to ourselves
9239618 is she uh does she know about you and i
9239619 oh gail cher knows everything we dont have any secrets from each other after i left you on sunday cher and i spent the evening talking about you before we fell asleep together in fact the only thing she was jealous about was that she didnt get to join in the fun
9239620 so you two are lovers then id wondered in fact i was sure but i didnt know how to ask so she would have joined us huh hmmm that might be a lot of fun some time
9239621 yeah it would be but very very cramped in our twin dorm beds
9239622 wow both my lovers together its too bad we dont have more time to explore this situation right now cher
9239623 katie you never cease to amaze me i had no idea youd just up and out me to her like that
9239624 yes from what i see i know i would too
9239625 cher ive got an idea for halloween but first what was so important that you needed to meet at lunch today
9239626 you already know im not doing well in a couple of my classes what with working in my off hours and all the studying piling up i still feel like i cant keep up
9239627 its not that i wont pass them i will i know i will but just barely and that means i wont maintain a
9239628 i really really worried i know my parents will pay my tuition but if i have to rent a place too i dont know i dont think they can afford that and working at starbucks just isnt going to make enough money to pay rent too
9239629 cher if we have to move we have to move
9239630 im not going to let you move away or have to go back home
9239631 but how youve told me your family cant afford to help much more than they can right
9239632 look it you two what if the three of us rented a place together maybe that would help we could all share in the rent
9239633 hell my parents are both so loaded they could afford to rent the place for all three of us theyre both successful realtors in the interior believe me they can afford it the only reason im staying in these little holes is because i needed a place for the first semester im already looking for somewhere else to live what about it
9239634 we know each other well enough to sleep together dont we even if cher and i havent yet we will
9239635 ive already found a couple of two bedroom apartments for 1100 00 a month in kitsilano beach that my parents were willing to rent for me alone how hard can it be to find a three bedroom for a little more you girls could afford to pay the extra between you right
9239636 even if you couldnt afford that ill bet if i told my parents it was 1500 a month theyd put up the bucks just to show each other up
9239637 come on you two what have you got to lose
9239638 ask and god provides katie i prayed for an answer this morning but i never expected a solution so quick katie im in

9239643 oh im pretty sure i can convince both dave and chris easily enough

9239645 oh yes more than interested waaayyy more than just interested

9239867 we want to take a trip somewhere near home that doesnt require a jet plane or a long car trip
9239868 we especially like to see what florida had to offer before the big theme parks arrived
9239869 that was one of the most memorable trips weve ever taken
9239870 although people are looking to save money they are still going to take a vacation
9239871 there is a lot of undiscovered florida even for long term residents
9239872 traditionally we have a lot of florida residents but even more so now that gas prices have soared
9239873 and once they are here they feel like theyve been somewhere else because we are so different from the hustle and bustle of the theme parks
9239874 the b amp b was completely renovated and we didnt even have to drive anywhere we just walked the short distance to downtown micanopy and visited the quaint little town it was like a trip down memory lane
9239875 were really at catastrophically low salinity levels in indian river and southern brevard county
9239876 were seeing salinities reduced by half in brevard and in indian river county theyre being reduced by three times
9239877 if we get a good storm and it brings us all the way into the cold period it could be spring before we see salinity return to normal
9239878 theres very little tidal action here so it takes an extremely long time for it to flush itself out
9239879 if the salinity can rebound relatively quickly like within the next two weeks shellfish shouldnt be affected too much
9239880 there is a higher likelihood for disease or bacteria coming in
9239881 the waters are very brown from the input of all that fresh water
9239882 pada hari itu diberitakan kepada manusia apa yang telah dikerjakannya dan apa yang dilalaikannya
9239883 ya rasulullah laki laki dan perempuan saling melihat aurat yang lain
9239884 pada saat itu segala urusan sangat dahsyat sehingga orang tidak memperhatikan mengindahkan hal itu
9239885 there is never a good time to raise the price customers pay for electricity and we know it is especially difficult when many are struggling to make ends meet during this economic slowdown
9239886 they the electric increases are going to be substantial for everybody
9239887 we asked them to re dress apparently when told to re dress they put on underwear and they were told to re dress again and they put the rest of their clothes on
9239888 they decided to put their clothes on because you know you cant send a message from a jail cell
9239889 i have always regarded music with lyrics as a species of fiction
9239890 all it takes is a big wake to send water onto the properties on the verge of flooding
9239891 there should be some signs of improvement by the weekend
9239892 it wont be drastic but it will be enough to get other services in
9239893 its not been easy but i am grateful they the center are here
9239894 it allows the parties to put the disputes behind them and clarifies the contractual requirements for the future
9239895 a workout that combines aerobics dance yoga and strength training
9239896 no charles not if you were there to provide for us
9239897 oh my can she handle all of what is to come especially the rigorous campaigning ahead over the next several weeks how will she really care for that precious little 4 month old son of hers with all that lies ahead
9239898 how should we feel about a mom running for vice presidency
9239899 how do i feel about a mother of young children running for vp
9239900 for those who love god all things work together for good
9239901 were doing it for internal prudent planning for transition teams its like a what if analysis
9239902 there are no serious discussions about actually flying the shuttle beyond 2010 a headline that says nasa is looking at flying the shuttle until 2015 wouldnt actually be accurate
9239903 so a new gap would form not between shuttle and orion but between shuttle and shuttle and what would we get even higher price per flight of an old technology which is not nearly as safe as we would like
9239904 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9239905 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9239906 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9239907 im a plastic bag please use me wisely i can be resued recycled and im also biodegradeable
9239908 i think we will still hear zombie nation played at the games it may not be for two minutes of stretch of time but that was an important spirit generating piece of our game last year and i think youll see it again this year
9239909 its definitely a concern and people should be very careful swimming this weekend
9239910 people should use common sense swim by a tower and if you get caught in a rip current dont fight it and swim parallel to the shore
9239911 the week before the storm there were areas even down here by seabreeze boulevard that were impassable
9239912 now the beach driving is better than it has been in years

9239956 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9239957 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9239958 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9239959 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9239960 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9239961 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever

9239964 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea

9239976 its important i think that the party does unite now they have the opportunity to do that
9239977 privatisation of course has always been a difficult issue for the labor party

9239990 i had a pretty good time last night but i know that most of us saw the lack of regular
9239991 there is no doubt that the changes made by your government have changed the landscape for churches and other faith groups in the united kingdom many steps have been taken but those that have affected us most can be listed as follows the 2001 manifesto commitment to increase and encourage partnership with faith groups has brought many more faith groups to the partnership table engaging them in public service delivery the introduction of discrimination legislation in employment has recognised the need to protect the ethos of religious organisations the introduction of religion and belief as a recognised category of difference into the equality and diversity framework has significantly progressed the discussion about religion and belief as a difference and an identity the fact that the commission for equality and human rights has a responsibility for religion and belief as a category of diversity is not only a first but will also continue the important discussion about how religion and belief relate to the everyday issues of equality and diversity the continued development of a more strategic approach to the third sector including the creation of the ots and the attempts made to move toward more sustainable funding long term partnerships and the establishment of clearer more accessible protocols the establishment of the academies programme and the consequent engagement in secondary education provision by a number of faith communities strengthening the choice and diversity of educational provision in the uk the recognition of a partnership approach to welfare provision and the significant steps that have been taken in ensuring services are aimed at local people shaped by local people and delivered by local people has completely changed both the language and the direction of the debate when it comes to community cohesion together with many other changes all of the above are beneficial for the development of a just and fair society they have helped to strengthen both the identity of faith groups and the ability of those faith groups to serve those who are marginalised and excluded when i compare the landscape of the voluntary sector and faith communities in 2007 to that of 1997 i am amazed by how far we have come
9239992 we believe that if education and understanding about how and why faith motivates peoples lives is supported in communities we can look foward to a time when the work of faith groups will be more welcome in society and when faith groups themselves will be concerned not only about a right to their own identities but committed to behaving with responsibility in society the privilege of public service and care provision for faith groups must be matched by a commitment on the part of those faith communities to behave as faithful citizens who uphold the basic tenets of both human dignity and citizenship to britain faith has the power to be a tremendously transformational part of our society but for that to happen people of faith must be committed to unconditional service and collaboration with others whilst retaining their own identity government must also be committed to full and fair partnership with faith communities
9239993 as the new labour party leader is elected and takes office i trust and pray that he will take all the achievements in the last decade and build upon them
9239994 is there any place in the labour party for someone who is socially liberal but morally conservative
9239995 the government has indicated a bold step in using the money left in dormant accounts to fund some of this work
9239996 it sounds like theyve been doing much more writing of books than leading of churches recently
9239997 now if we want to get miss piggy out of jail were going to have to catch those thieves red handed yes beau
9239998 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works
