2410000 there are heaps of great cooks out there you dont need to be a chef or an expert to create a fantastic family meal in the crock pot
2410001 and here is a way for them to share their experiences and tastes with everyone else with the added benefit of winning a prize
2410002 i am absolutely thrilled for melanie that she was able to get her lift back
2410003 she has had to overcome so many obstacles in her personal and athletic life and now her dreams have finally been realized her dedication and perseverance are an inspiration to the rest of us melanie truly embodies the olympic spirit and wish her all the best as she continues this journey i am glad to have played a small roll in this triumph
2410004 if it wasnt for dr bray and the wonderful job he did on my surgery i would never be in this position
2410005 at first i was a bit apprehensive because you hear about so many horror stories with back surgery but i knew a lot of wonderful people that really believed in dr bray and i went on faith the main reason i selected him was the fact that he understood the mind of an athlete
2410006 the care he put into my surgery taking extra time to save every muscle fiber possible to speed the recovery peeling away the muscle just stretching it rather than cutting it made the recovery that much quicker and smoother
2410007 dr bray was so smart and open minded he gave me guidance but trusted me and my coach john thrush to let me go at the pace i was comfortable with and trust my body my back is stronger than it has ever been and within seven months i was 100 and beyond what i was before the surgery
2410008 before i had no idea the surgery existed and thought that this was the pain i was going to have to live with for the rest of my life
2410009 athletics aside i am so glad i did it just for quality of life purposes because when you have the deep sore ache in your back it affects every part of your life and your daily routine including picking up my children other people suffering back pain should really consider exploring this type of surgery
2410010 melanies case is the perfect illustration of treating a back injury or back pain initially through conservative measures and then selecting surgery as the last option
2410011 her procedure also highlights the revolution taking place in this field in the past back surgeries were very lengthy required long hospitalization stays and extended recuperation and rehabilitative periods today even some fusions can be done on an outpatient basis and innovative stabilization devices that implanted maintain range of motion melanies situation is far from unique and it is important for people suffering from back pain to do their research and learn as much as they can about the variety of options available to them with a qualified surgeon

2410022 the second set was probably the first really good set i have played in four months i started to move the ball around well so that was a really good feeling
2410023 i think this match could be one that i look back on as a turning point in the year

2410078 i think the most difficult part of the last 24 hours is just coming to the realization that youre no longer wanted by your organization
2410079 you spend eight years with an organization and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there thats just the crude part of the business thats sometimes hard to accept emotionally physically and mentally i feel good about the situation i actually have an inner peace about it

2410099 the image that the media presents about black people is that we are inferior we are not as good as everybody else but those who are successful and going places are those who are light skinned people so one might say that the desire to be like white people underpins peoples wanting to be fairer skinned

2410107 wilayah kota bandung cukup luas dengan jumlah penduduk lebih dari 2 5 juta keadaan ini tentu tidak sebanding bila dikaitkan dengan jumlah personil satpol pp saat ini yang hanya memiliki 550 anggota
2410108 idealnya seharusnya ada 1 500 sampai 2 000 personil untuk mendukung implementasi tugas yang diemban satpol pp kota bandung dan seyogyanya semua pihak bijak dalam menyikapi kinerja suatu lembaga seperti satpol pp ini bijak dalam melihat dan memahami sumber daya yang dimiliki serta tugas yang sangat kompleks untuk memberikan rasa nyaman dan tertib kepada masyarakat
2410109 beban kerja yang dihadapi satpol pp cukup berat karena harus melaksanakan 33 peraturan daerah perda satu perda saja banyak pelanggarannya bagaimana jika ada 33 perda
2410110 sekarang ini satpol pp baru memiliki sarana 26 kendaraan roda dua 4 mobil dan 6 truk 2 angkutan barang dan 4 angkutan personil keadaan yang sangat minim untuk memberikan pelayanan ketertiban dan keamanan serta penegakan perda lainnya kepada masyarakat tetapi ini bukan halangan kami untuk melaksanakan tugas walau memiliki keterbatasan kami tetap berusaha mencapai hasil maksimal
2410111 secara ideal untuk tegaknya suatu peraturan daerah ada beberapa faktor yang mempengaruhi baik faktor kesadaran masyarakat amanat infrastruktur peraturan kelengkapan dan kejelasan peraturan serta pelaksanaan penegakan peraturan daerah
2410112 namun harus diakui bahwa hasilnya belum sepenuhnya memuaskan bahkan perlu terus ditingkatkan karena bisa dilihat tak jarang segala proses telah kita tempuh tetapi pelanggaran tetap ada
2410113 tetapi kami tidak pernah merasa bosan untuk terus menerus meningkatkan kesadaran masyarakat dan dalam menegakan perda satpol pp tidak akan melihat status seseorang yang jelas siapa pun pelanggar perda akan kami tindak sesuai peraturan yang berlaku
2410114 bertambahnya jumlah penduduk yang tidak diimbangi dengan penyediaan lapangan kerja menyebabkan semakin tingginya angka pengangguran ketidakmampuan memiliki tempat tinggal akses kesehatan yang buruk dan lain lain memicu meningkatnya masalah ketertiban dan keamanan
2410115 tetapi khusus untuk pkl kan pemerintah kota bandung sudah memberikan tempat bagi mereka namun terkadang mereka seolah tidak peduli
2410116 kami sering mendengar bahwa satpol pp dianggap kejam tidak berperikemanusiaan dalam menjalankan tugasnya padahal yang kita hadapi adalah masyarakat yang melanggar perda dan program walikota yang jelas jelas membuat kota ini tidak tentram dan tertib
2410117 perlu digarisbawahi sebetulnya jika kita memaknai perda perda adalah perwujudan kehendak rakyat dan sebenarnya banyak orang yang sudah paham tapi ada juga yang belum memahami tentang perda dengan kata lain perda dan walikota melaksanakan kehendak rakyat dan yang membantu melaksanakannya adalah satpol pp di sini bisa diartikan juga bahwa kami melaksanakan amanah rakyat
2410118 jika dalam perda dilarang berjualan di trotoar itu kata rakyat bukan kata satpol pp inilah yang sering dikecam oleh masyarakat bahwa itu aturan satpol pp
2410119 memang ini menjadi sebuah dilema yang harus dihadapi satpol pp dalam menjalankan tugasnya di satu sisi satpol pp juga bagian dari warga kota bandung namun di sisi lain satpol pp pun dituntut tegas terhadap para pelanggar perda sekali lagi saya tegaskan kami hanya melaksanakan amanah rakyat satpol pp juga punya hati nurani tapi harus harus melaksanakan tugas
2410120 dengan kata lain urusan satpol pp sangat luas di berbagai bidang cakupan program pemerintah kota bandung
2410121 jika kita melihat situasi politik saat ini ada semacam euporia sedikit saja kita melakukan tindakan maka akan terjadi demonstrasi dan tak jarang berujung anarkis jadi memang kita berada pada suasana transisi menuju demokrasi yang sebenarnya sementara masyarakat terkadang kebablasan memaknainya sehingga melanggar peraturan juga dianggap kebebasan ala hreformasi
2410122 seharusnya masyarakat dan satpol pp mampu mewujudkan suatu sinergi yang memberikan kekuatan dalam mencapai tatanan masyarakat yang aman tentram dan nyaman jika seluruh stakeholder pembangunan ini mampu berbuat demikian maka tugas kami menjadi semakin ringan

2410143 a serious threat hangs over the development of european football the malign and ever present influence of money
2410144 i know g14 have said this but from our discussions it seems the main opposition is at liverpool and manchester united who have investors out to make a quick buck on their investment and are only looking at the financial risks of the reform plan and not the sporting merits
2410145 basically by giving away a spot in their league to cup winners they see this as reducing their chances of entering the lucrative champions league
2410146 love the game and are not just in it for the money
2410147 money has always been in sport but money has never been the ultimate objective of football the main purpose has been to win trophies
2410148 for the first time we may be entering an era in which financial profit alone will be the measure of sporting success
2410149 i made it absolutely clear to platini last week that i was representing the views of the majority of english premier league clubs when i said we do not support the reform plan
2410150 i didnt even discuss this issue with our owners prior to last week bottom line is that allowing the cup winners into the competition devalues the premier league
2410151 we completely refute the allegations our decision to oppose the plan for the champions league regarding the cup winners is based on merit and follows consultations with in particular sir
2410152 i might agree to part with it if i get a good offer the last offer i got was for 4 3m
2410153 we began talking after a preliminary introduction he told me that he had a rare copy of a holy quran it was handwritten and a little less than 400 years old he asked me if i would accept it for safekeeping
2410154 i agreed to accept the copy for i felt i was being blessed it was a huge responsibility
2410155 i took immense care and preserved the manuscript so sunlight and moist air did not spoil it it was a proud possession and the most valuable asset of my life

2410165 and there was a rush of wind as i turned toward you your hand holding the knife that was meant for my back the eyes gave away your astonishment through your mask but i saw it coming long ago will you drop the knife now it seems you wont taking stabs at me when im not aware poisoning the opinions of others about what i represent the cup that you hand me im afraid is also poisoned but you never noticed that i cant be trusted either
2410166 howdy folk dont fergit the high cost alivin handle this with special care seems we aint got none to spare if everyone is paper hawgs well hafta go back to catalougs
2410167 well know more of a time scale when he sees our doctors but its not a good situation it kind of puts a damper on things i know how much he wanted to get back and was very excited about finally feeling healthy
2410168 i feel really bad for him its one of those crazy things hit in the foot by a line drive well just let the doctors look at him and see where we go from here
2410169 he seems to think hell be able to start activity next week and go from there hell be in a splint for another week and start working out with us and start taking batting practice next week right now everything is good
2410170 he really believes he can play right handed right now
2410171 i wouldnt be afraid to do that whether we will nor not i dont know

2410176 we urge the chinese to do what other countries have done to sanction to put a financial squeeze on the burmese generals
2410177 all sides must remember that attacks on civilians or acts intended to terrorize civilians clearly violate international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes

2410185 our heart rate was so high im seriously happy it is over and i hold gold
2410186 i feel really bad for du li i do and id like to give these flowers to her because she can shoot way better than she did today
2410187 sorry the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2410188 i had a hard time handling my own pressure its obvious to see theres a lot of pressure on du everywhere every day in training all around her
2410189 she did a fantastic job im so proud of her
2410190 it happened to me once too you just want to take a break and chat
2410191 so her dad and i just talked to her for a minute
2410192 its great to have him i knew id do good even if he couldnt be here and hed do great if i wasnt here the fact were here together is awesome we work as a team its one of the best in the world
2410193 the first set i won 6 3 but i really didnt feel super comfortable
2410194 the second set was probably the first really good set i have played in four months i started to move the ball around well so that was a really good feeling
2410195 i think this match could be one that i look back on as a turning point in the year
2410196 i made a couple of mistakes the guy started to feel much more comfortable on the court and the momentum was gone
2410197 i didnt serve very well in the third set and the balls are pretty slow so it was difficult for my game i could not change it by serving and volleying it was perfect for him because he was playing very simple tennis
2410198 yes it would be good if i am but i am not going to shoot myself if i am not
2410199 i wish i could find a way try not to cry
2410200 if you dont have fifteen dollars get the hell out of my cab

2410207 heaven is not a place its just an idea but its a very strong idea because if we didnt have it we wouldnt have any hope
2410208 madness is rare in individuals but in groups parties nations and ages it is the rule
2410209 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
2410210 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again
2410211 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
2410212 an open mind is not a mind devoid of opinion but one that is able to change opinion in the face of new evidence
2410213 a state or nation in which the supreme power rests in all the citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by representatives elected directly or indirectly by them and responsible to them
2410214 he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance
2410215 in our theoretical discussions we should frankly recognize that we have abandoned the basic idea that executive legislative and judicial power should be separated from each other in order to protect us against tyranny
2410216 the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judiciary in the same hands whether of one a few or many and whether hereditary self appointed or elected may just pronounce the very definition of tyranny
2410217 the legislative branch neither must nor can it transfer the power of making laws to anybody else or place it anywhere but where the people have
2410218 that congress cannot delegate legislative power to the president is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution
2410219 a carte blanche authority to furnish military supplies to the allies at his own discretion
2410220 the 1970 legislation contains no declaration of purpose other than the cryptic title designation cost of living stabilization the standards supplied if anything are more vague than those found in the wartime statute congress in 1970 authorized the president to issue orders and regulations as he may deem appropriate in order to provide for the making of such adjustment as may be necessary to prevent gross inequities no administrative agency is designed or created instead the president is permitted to delegate the performance of any function under the act to any federal department or agency as he may deem appropriate
2410221 under this interpretation of executive power i did and caused to be done many things not previously done by the president and the heads of the departments i did not usurp powers but i did greatly broaden the use of executive power
2410222 all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states
2410223 in all tyrannical governments the right both of making and enforcing the laws is vested in one and the same man or one and the same body of men and wherever these two bodies are united together there is no public liberty

2410276 music downloading is a double edged sword on one hand you have the obvious decline in cd sales but on the other without online distribution some bands would never be heard ive downloaded an artist only to buy the cd later
2410277 do you think music being downloaded illegally helps or hurts the music business
2410278 do you think music being downloaded illegally helps or hurts the music business
2410279 i definitely think that downloading free music may have a negative effect on the music business as far as major labels go
2410280 i think if you are radiohead and trent reznor and never have to worry about money ever again its a great idea but not a lot of bands can afford to take 5 years without doing many shows or releasing records and then when theyre done give it away for free though most people take it for free anyway theres a lot of talk about this changing the industry and maybe it will but you have to understand they did it from a position of extreme privilege they also have so many people interested in their music that even if most people dont pay or it averages at a low price theyll make out ok i read that the average price people are paying for the radiohead album is only 1 but they had a million people download it so that works out well for them anyway we certainly couldnt afford to do it we could try it but wed have to take up day jobs and wouldnt be able to tour as often and itd take us longer to make our music plus we still believe in the physical product and you may have noticed that when it came to the actual cd and lp radiohead are going through xl as far as free culture i cant say i support it ive discussed this on the board many times but the argument that music and art should not be limited to those who can afford it is kind of bullshit in my opinion at least how its made by the people who believe they have the right to download in an ideal world of course it should be free to everyone but its not that world right now think about how much money you spend on your computer and your internet connection or how much your parents spend on it and then ask youself how many people in the world can afford the tools to access the so called free culture i could walk 5 minutes out my front door and be in a neighborhood where there probably arent teenagers with their own computers or high speed internet and the public school systems certainly cant afford to do that one computer for every kid program stuff they do in wealthier school districts in addition we need money to live and it costs money to make our music we have to buy gear pay practice space rent have upfront money to rent a van and print tshirts before we go on tour etc but on the other hand i dont complain about downloading in the way i used to while it is stealing and depriving us from money we are owed there is no denying most kids these days find music on the internet without paying for it or at least the kind of kids who would get into ac that helps us tour in places we could never go to in the past helps us get people into the clubs to see us and most importantly gets our music out there to peoples ears that might not have heard about it if mass access to most music was still primarily controlled by commercial radio or mtv
2410281 im going to officially add this to the list of questions weve been asked and answered too many times so from here on out im not going to respond just want to say that the above comments about it hurting the big guys and not the little guys is just flat out wrong i fully admit that illegal downloading does help out smaller bands in terms of exposure and this can pay off in terms of touring the fact that weve been able to travel to places like estonia or a band like black dice could go to peru and play on national tv is a direct positive result of downloading and one im not gonna complain about the most important thing is that people hear the music but for all the talk of sticking it to the big guys do you guys realize what youre doing to the rest of the independent music community think about the small indie mom and pop record stores they dont see the benefits of us touring do they we have tons of friends that work in small indie stores and they will tell that sales have been going consistently down in a big way why do you think a store like other music now has a digital shop ive seen countless small stores have to close due to falling record sales indie distributors are laying off people reducing the amount of records they carry in their catalog etc its not just the big guys as for the smaller bands and record labels just look at the above responses from the people in the community do you really think you as a fan and downloader have more of an enlightened perspective than these people even for a label like paw tracks weve had to serious discuss whether or not we can afford to do large cd and vinyl pressings todd the owner of ptracks and carpark now signs some bands to exclusively digital contracts because he knows if he spends the money on manufacturing physical products hell never break even and will lose money to the point that the label can no longer exist the thing that irks me the most about people who download is the self justification you guys do you make arguments to justify a behavior that is convenient for you when you know its illegal and hurting the bands you claim to support maybe some of you go out and buy the records but most people dont people in the music industry are constantly surprised by how low our record sales are compared to the exposure and press we get i cant even tell how many times on tour people have come up and personally apologized to me for downloading our music and never buying the records some people try and give me 5 bills as a gesture to make up for it downloading is how its gonna go for the forseeable future everyone is doing it even musicians who are hurt by it i dont have a solution and i understand why people do it i still dont but if a friend has a cd i want to hear ill rip it onto my computer which is the same thing so even im guilty of it but im willing to admit im stealing as long as someone is man enough to admit that its cool with me but i cannot have a conversation with people who have no direct connection to the music industry that try and come up with some kind of argument that justifies the behavior it costs money to make music costs money for the record labels to manufacture and distribute it there is no argument in the present system that justifies music being free for that to be the case music and art would have to be subsidized by the government through tax dollars but ive talked to some people who live in countries where that is the case and they feel like that has a negative effect on the quality of music because it takes away a bit of the work ethic required for bands to challenge themselves i cant speak to that personally and dont really have an opinion but anyway for the last time there are positive and negative effects but from what ive seen financially its predominantly negative even for the small guys by the way i love that comment about how much people hate big labels for releasing something as harmless as popular music brilliant the beatles and michael jackson were popular music so is a lot of hiphop which has pretty sweet and adventurous production justin timberlake has some awesome jams is it really that bad the majority of people in this world like it were the minority here who are we to say were right it goes back to mobys argument that he made a few years back when he sad maybe if people spent more money on adventurous and non mainstream music then the mainstream would be forced to pay attention to it like what happened with nirvana you guys ever think of how much money you spend on products that have way more of a negative impact on this world is every piece of paper you come in contact with from recycled material if not i suggest you start stealing it from stores so the paper industry will realize there is no point in cutting down more trees

2410343 i was upstairs in my cell and was told by the guards that my lawyer was here to see me
2410344 i told the guards i did not think that was possible because i knew that my only lawyer mr gruel had returned to san francisco the day before
2410345 based on my knowledge of mdc procedures i believe this reporter misrepresented herself as my attorney by using her legal bar card to get in to see me
2410346 every time i go to see him its like trying to get into ft knox
2410347 on several occasions the district court or its appointees exceeded the role of impartial arbiter by issuing orders without hearings and by actively participating in evidence gathering
2410348 the july 12 opinion levels serious charges against interior and its officials charges that not only bear no relationship to the issue pending before the court but also go beyond criticizing interior for its serious failures as trustee and condemn the department as an institution
2410349 in short in case after case the district court granted extensive relief against interior and in case after case we reversed even under highly deferential standards of review
2410350 congress capacity to function effectively is not threatened by permitting congressional offices to be searched pursuant to validly issued search warrants
2410351 no one argues that the warrant executed upon congressman jeffersons office was not properly administered
2410352 therefore there was no impermissible intrusion on the legislature the fact that some privileged material was incidentally captured by the search does not constitute an unlawful intrusion
2410353 while a congressman is not above the law the executive branch must also follow the law
2410354 we appreciate the consideration the judge accorded our motion for the return of the seized property but we respectfully disagree with his conclusion and we intend to appeal the ruling
2410355 jefferson may never be questioned regarding his legitimate legislative activities is immune from civil or criminal liability for those activities and no privileged material may ever be used against him in court
2410356 wait a second john barrie is making all these accusations but he does not list what she actually plagiarized we dont know if he is just grumpy or telling the truth
2410357 tpm muckracker has an itemized list of ann coulters supposed plagiarism and sorry to say
2410358 my impression as well and i loathe the woman but two different authors using the same quote is not plagiarism
2410359 oh well looks like she goes back to just being a disgraceful human being and a lousy writer
2410360 we have reviewed the allegations of plagiarism surrounding godless and found them to be as trivial and meritless as they are irresponsible
2410361 any author is entitled to do what ann coulter has done in the three snippets cited research and report facts
2410362 in delaware the largest growth of population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
2410363 joe biden has a history of making insensitive and inappropriate remarks
2410364 in 2004 sen john kerry referred to sikhs as terrorists and sen hillary clinton jokingly referred to mahatma gandhi as a gas station owner
2410365 a clear double standard in the mainstream media will likely ensure sen biden gets a pass over these comments that would get a republican in deep trouble if he ever made a similar statement
2410366 so hows business these days raking it in are you

2410374 berkeley is penalizing the sea scouts for exercising their first amendment right of association in ways that city officials dont like
2410375 may government punish you or fine you or subject you to second class treatment if you dont pass a politically correct litmus test thats the question raised by this case its a question that deserves to be heard by the united states supreme court
2410376 the bottom line is that berkeley officials are punishing the kids that participate in the sea scouts to make a political statement and thats a real tragedy
2410377 it cannot demand tickets of admission in the form of convictions and affiliations that it deems acceptable
2410378 although enunciated in a state court case the principle voiced by traynor is consistent with the united states supreme courts cases defending first amendment rights
2410379 for this reason we hope that the high court will accept the case and right the wrong being done to the berkeley sea scouts

2410382 more frequently than what we would like we find out that the intelligence community has been penetrated not necessarily by al qaeda but by other nations or organizations
2410383 i dont have any evidence but from my perspective when you have information that is leaked that is clearly helpful to our enemy you cannot discount that possibility
2410384 there will be a renewed effort by the justice department in a couple of these cases to go through the entire process so they can prosecute
2410385 ive heard several people ask about the all church picnic this year and when it will be so please forgive me for not communicating sooner sad but true we will not be hosting an all church picnic this year the lead team made a decision earlier this year that had to do primarily with finances and our need to remain fiscally responsible despite receiving generous donations from our vendors the picnic was still a cost to ccc of 12 000 to 15 000 annually im sorry to be the bearer of bad news this was a difficult but necessary decision in light of our offerings being below our budget ytd and the new expense reimbursement protocols in place

2410747 while the actual fragrance of the imitations often displayed only a minimal deviation from the original the differences were clearly recognizable from other features the weight of the bottle the lettering used or the curvature in the bottom of the bottle pointed towards them being forgeries for the buyers it admittedly appears not to be so important as to whether they have bought a forgery or an original they showed hardly any reaction it was only in only a few individual cases that they gave a negative appraisal and spoke out about forgery whereas according to the study 99 per cent sic of opinions were positive

2410766 this was truly a rapid change and it can be attributed to youtubes different and correct attitude towards surfers it simply allowed every user to upload video files onto the website added user ratings and created an environment that made users want to return again and again youtube created an internet community
2410767 thats true and its the greatness of the internet if you do something nice you dont have to big like yahoo you have a chance this is basically our message to israeli entrepreneurs were saying there is here in israel the potential for the next youtube it may not be in video which is already occupied but there are other fields fields we havent yet thought of we know that this potential exists here
2410768 youtube had no chance of an ipo now but only in another year besides we decided not to wait because we understood that we didnt have another google in the hand nevertheless to sell for 1 6 billion is a great thing the last time an internet company was sold for over 1 billion was in 2001 youtubes entrepreneurs received quite a few acquisition offers in recent months and im glad they waited this is also a message for start ups sometimes its better to wait and not sell at the first or second offer

2410770 fortunately for us there was no need to insist we put down money right at the start and the company subsequently already knew where it was going and refrained from bringing in additional investors thats another advantage of internet companies they dont need a lot of money to function while on the other hand they build a user base of hundreds of millions of users
2410771 two young and brilliant entrepreneurs came to us we already knew them from pay pal an online payment service provider where youtubes founders chad harley and steve chen worked d a there were actually a lot of opinions around the table not everyone thought we should go for this
2410772 the entrepreneurs came to us with an unproven model but we were impressed that they were both internet mavens and that they had a winning approach and an understanding that surfers must be involved in the process of creating the content that they consume they talked about cooperation and community and persuaded us to put down a little money as for their personalities we felt that they could build a venture of this size

2410852 the signs of the times point toward the close of the time of the gentiles and the return of jesus can be expected any moment

2410862 she sounds like the type who makes out with her bff just to get a dudes attention
2410863 isnt problematic because it promotes homosexuality but because its appropriation of the gay lifestyle exists for the sole purpose of garnering attention both from perrys boyfriend and her audience
2410864 comes across as a taunting insecure schoolyard bully with serious gender and sex issues
2410865 were just pawns in her transgressive experiments she has to resort to the unfortunately not uncommon use of gay sexual identity as a slur as in someone no one likes or wants to be

2410867 katy dear this is 2008 we need to stop using gay as an insult being gay is normal if you use gay as synonym for bad negative horrible stupid or any of the many other derogatory words it has been used in place of to place insult then you are propagating and continuing the underlying bigotry that is so fervent in this country continuing this form of hidden bigotry is just intolerable and i for one feel like i must continue to speak out against it

2410869 the semiotic point of view is the perspective that results from the consequences of one simple realization the whole of our experience is a network or web of sign relations
2410870 semiosphere is the set of all interconnected umwelten any two umwelten when communicating are a part of the same semiosphere
2410871 semiosphere as a space of diversity provides us with the insight into the similarity between various processes of relational diversification

2410873 semiosphere is thus the totality of interconnected signs a sphere that covers the earth

2410956 coach rod marinelli is hard on penalties and its something where ill get better ill work on it and get better
2410957 i take a lot of pride in what i do were talking about football professionals here yes i was mad i wanted to go out there and hit guys and have fun but i didnt want to put the team in a hole with my stupid penalties
2410958 for my effort i gave it what i got an a
2410959 i had a couple of mental breakdowns there but at the end of the game i played my heart out but ive got to clean it up thats what i think these preseason games are for the rookies can clean stuff up and fine tune things
2410960 when youre supposed to get your running back and youre dropping 10 yards deep thats a mental mistake in my book and especially in linebacker coach phil snows book
2410961 ive got to fix every mistake i made in every situation ive got to fix it now training camp is coming down to the end
2410962 it was just average i was just getting a feel for the game

2410968 throw a scout an agent a coach and an entrepreneur into a blender then mix and you have a buscone
2410969 their possible roles in a growing financial scandal involving the signing of players from the dominican republic
2410970 at no time when i met with the fbi investigators were questions revolving around myself or jose rijo
2410971 i hate to admit it but it really works in the players favor if you go back to the old system nobody would discover them nobody would help them
2410972 we can not go and see a kid whos 14 or 15
2410973 but a buscone can have a kid live with him at his makeshift academy they feed them house them and once theyre 16 theyre showing them to us
2410974 what has happened though is that a lot of american based agents are hiring guys down there to be their extension scott boras and a lot of other big agents here have hired guys there to recruit these kids they fund it
2410975 you cant just talk about it you have to go out there and do it
2410976 we didnt really get anything going try anything or do anything
2410977 but with that right handed hitting lineup youd think you would be able to get more than two runs
2410978 it wasnt a good bunt but it took a funny hop
2410979 im just trying to make a mark here and do what i can to help the program im very competitive so i want to get in and play i have to earn everything
2410980 he has really jumped out at us hes explosive he catches the ball tremendously well he has soft hands
2410981 being as raw as he was coming in weve stepped back a few times and taken notice of him
2410982 once he gets a full year under his belt with strength and conditioning coach ken mannie with all the proper nutrition weight lifting and conditioning it kind of remains to be seen
2410983 he has good size and strength we want to use that to our advantage
2410984 were just teaching him how to line up how to run a route trust me for a freshman thats more than enough right there
2410985 what drives people into buying merchandise is the affiliation and association with the team and being a fan of a player

2410994 on my scouting trips i used to be amazed there would be kids at 11 a m in the morning playing baseball many of them didnt go to school
2410995 they have a great deal of passion for baseball they love it they play it they know its history
2410996 when i was active in baseball we had a few latins here and there
2410997 now theyve pretty much taken charge but only because they can play thats the bottom line they can play
2410998 there are many great players from my country now as time goes by there will only be more
2410999 i was working in a factory that made jeans and we had a baseball team that played on weekends
2411000 this was around 1979 i was 18 and with the money i made at the factory i bought a motorcycle i was riding that motorcycle when my sister found me and said there was a scout waiting for me at my moms house
2411001 i didnt think she knew anything about baseball let alone scouts so i wasnt going to go
2411002 there were a lot of guys in the past who just got too old because nobody saw them they were good players who didnt make it because nobody saw them play now its easier because every team is down there if youre good somebody is going to know that
2411003 this contributes to the notion that latinos are merely recent arrivals to baseball a perception that unfortunately shapes contemporary discussions of race and americas game and that often leaves latinos as an afterthought while shortchanging their long history of contributions
2411004 players were coming out of cuba but cuba got shut down
2411005 88 dominicans were on opening day rosters 10 fewer than last years record but nine more than in 2004 and about 2 200 dominican minor leaguers were under contract to big league teams a jump of more than 40 percent from three years earlier
2411006 i dont know if youre going to see a higher percentage of latino players in the majors its pretty high now
2411007 but i can tell you that if youre an organization thats not doing your due diligence in having a good percentage of latin american players coming through your ranks eventually your club is going to get hurt
2411008 close to 30 percent of the players are from a foreign country and the majority of that 30 percent is from latin america so it behooves you to start producing from there or your team is going to fall behind youre not going to get all the talent thats necessary
2411009 we used to use cereal boxes milk cartons or detergent boxes for a glove
2411010 cut out a hole in it and that was your glove for a bat wed trim pieces of wood off an avocado tree
2411011 tony fernandez a former blue jays shortstop used to take kernels of corn and try to hit them with a broomstick we used to kid him that pitchers werent going to throw him corn we did whatever it took
2411012 we played in the street using a plastic ball with tape wound around it
2411013 we also used a plastic bat with paper stuffed in it to make it seem solid i threw hard when we played in the street when i got to a tryout thats what i did i threw as hard as i could
2411014 the only way to get off the island is to have a good fastball to have power and you have to be young
2411015 thats why they fib about their age because theyre doing everything they can to get seen and to take care of their family
2411016 its much more in depth and sophisticated now than when i first started
2411017 there were a few organizations that were aggressive in the dominican or venezuela but now we have a scouting network in each one of the countries and its not only us but nearly every club in baseball
2411018 you might still find a sleeper but the agents have infiltrated latin america and they have their own networks or their bird dog scouts
2411019 maybe it happens in some other parts of central america but when youre talking about the dominican and venezuela that old style type of scouting has disappeared
2411020 double the average teams paid latin prospects only three years ago
2411021 we anticipate continuing to be very aggressive not just in latin america
2411022 i would anticipate its an area well continue to pursue

2411033 fair trade means community its people coming together to improve their world whether its farmers coming together in a cooperative or consumers coming together as a community to reach out to those very same farmers in the end its about the relationships we build
2411034 basically we had the cart before the horse we passed our laws long before there was a movement to recognize us then went back and built the movement to recognize it
2411035 there were lots of initial meetings with town staff and procurement people to educate them about fair trade once they understood what it was theyve been on board and enthusiastic supporters
2411036 obviously this is a key step in order to effectively meet all of the other goals but people are busy and typically have many interests and obligations
2411037 there are things we didnt anticipate like people having trouble seeing how being a fair trade town fits in with their businesses especially when its not a business that sells any kind of food products or is a business that isnt interested in crafts in a traditional sense
2411038 think of the underworld as the back of your closet behind all those racks of clothes that you dont wear anymore things are always getting pushed back there and forgotten about the underworld is full of things that youve forgotten about

2411296 they went through our entire truck they did not go through our toiletries which we were surprised about but they opened up the laptop and i guess one of the icons said porn on it

2411299 how is that going to protect us or keep us safe what a waste of manpower what a waste of the security state shouldnt they be looking for knives and guns wouldnt that be a better use of their time
2411300 you dont want your name flagged when you cross the border it is a major inconvenience its not just that youd lose your laptop its that you cant fly into or connect in any american airports without a lot of hassle and so people ask themselves if its worth it
2411301 they have no legal right to keep either of those
2411302 there is nothing wrong with watersports its not an obscene activity its something that lots of gay couples participate in and fisting our court case 10 years ago proved that fisting is not an obscene activity

2411313 dan dari buah korma dan anggur kamu buat minimuman yang memabukkan dan rezki yang baik sesunggguhnya pada yang demikian itu benar benar terdapat tanda
2411314 pada keduanya terdapat dosa yang besar dan beberapa manfaat bagi manusia tetapi dosa keduanya lebih besar dari manfaatnya

2411317 hai orang orang yang beriman sesungguhnya khamar berjudi berhala mengundi nasib dengan panah adalah termasuk perbuatan syaitan maka jauhilah perbuatan perbuatan itu agar kamu mendapat keberuntungan 90 sesungguhnya syaitan itu bermaksud hendak menimbulkan permusuhan dan kebencian di antara kamu lantaran khamar dan berjudi itu dan menghalangi kamu dari mengingat allah dan sembahyang maka berhentilah kamu

2411341 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
2411342 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
2411343 it is on record that he okiro was promoted from commissioner of police cp to deputy inspector general dig without ever being an assistant inspector general aig even his confirmation as ig bypassed ogbonnaya onovo who was senior to him
2411344 beyond this however we have other issues to take up with the police service commission we are alarmed that about 40 of the demoted officers compared to nine from the north come from the south west zone which means they are all yoruba we want to be convinced that this is not another continuation of geographical manipulations to ensure that a certain ethnic stock continues to take all the sensitive positions in the force now and in the future
2411345 ribadu was posted from the efcc to kuru on the excuse that he was an aig who has not gone through nipss national institute of policy and strategic studies course this means the regime accepted his rank to turn around now and demote him is a confirmation of the fears that is the hallmark of public policy under the administration
2411346 they are going to exhume his body and re bury him with his new rank
2411347 i condemn as absolutely bizarre the demotion of malam nuhu ribadu from assistant inspector general of police to deputy commissioner of police after his illegal and unjustifiable removal as efcc chairman
2411348 malam nuhu ribadus non criminal offence for these atrocious and oppressive actions of the federal government against him is his ribadus honest character and the unprecedented arrest arraignment and trial of some powerful big men for corruption i want president umaru musa yaradua to realise that any government that punishes honesty sows the seeds of its inevitable destruction by corruption
2411349 they sent him here and he is more than half way through his programme so what do we do this is the first time we are facing this kind of situation i am waiting for instruction from above i dont think it is wise for us to say anything on the issue more so that police authorities have not briefed us on the demotion since we read it in the newspapers we cannot just tell him to go away on that basis we are waiting for a directive from above and until we hear from there we cannot do anything
2411350 how can you say that a man who won the inspector general of police award thrice in row long before he was appointed the efcc boss did not deserve accelerated promotion this man was awarded the inspector general of the federation award before he was appointed the boss of the efcc this man won some landmark cases that are cited in courts today before he was appointed the efcc boss when he got to the efcc no matter what anybody says he did not do a bad job and they are saying that he did not deserve accelerated promotion who then deserves this promotion
2411351 what happened between december when the president persuaded ribadu to go to kuru for the programme and now that the world seems to be falling apart for the man apart from the so called fast track promotion why are the security agencies chasing the man
2411352 based on the press conference held on 24th july 2008 at the government media center colombo by senior dig nimal mediwake

2411358 we have to say we re mighty frustrated to see evidence that the olympics is happening all around us but when we turn on nbc we get today show hosts yapping about chinese breakfast foods
2411359 the important thing to notice here is that dave does not see blog comments as productive to the free exchange of ideas they are a part of the problem not the solution you dont have a right to post your thoughts at the bottom of someone elses thoughts thats not freedom of expression thats an infringement on their freedom of expression get your own space write compelling things and if your ideas are smart theyll be linked to and google will notice and youll move up in pagerank and youll have influence and your ideas will have power
2411360 the app store was a big deal but thats one phone this is an entire carrier
2411361 we did not come from darfur or places like that begging for help
2411362 we worked for the australian government in jobs that put our families at great risk no one was ever going to kill us in iraq for just being refugees they wanted to kill us because we were working for the australians
2411363 no one from defence has said thank you great work thanks for helping us
2411364 in iraq we worked together here they dont seem to want to know us
2411365 i am very happy with the manner in which defence discharged its responsibilities in providing safe passage to australia for the locally engaged employees and neither i nor my office has received any complaints since their arrival in the country
2411366 this is a very well rehearsed very professional service that goes into refugee camps and does this sort of processing
2411367 we have australian cultural orientation classes that are run in the refugee camps these would not have been supplied in these circumstances because essentially youre in a war zone so the iraqis may well have missed out on some of the cultural orientation processes that would normally be provided but that would be the only thing
2411368 life here is very difficult for us and not as they told us in iraq
2411369 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2411370 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2411371 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2411372 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2411373 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2411374 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2411375 saq jun 18th 2008 1 51pm one of my very wealthy customers ordered this device on my recommendation and i got to play with it for a few days before he picked it up and left for his annual trip around the world he loves the device btw this pda is really awesome the screen and ergonomics of it are just perfect for what its intended for even a 3 5

2411380 npl is not an american or european tour its a true worldwide poker circuit open to everyone
2411381 npl wants to redefine the tour as a strong advocate of we feel its no longer a game but an established sport
2411382 it was an exciting two days of poker i cant complain about second place because i am still taking home over 100 000 from borgata
2411383 doyle was a trailblazer back in the days when poker news was a harsh and unforgiving existence forever a devout and gentle man he spent his much of his life having to endure askance looks from respectable people while being robbed and cheated by disrespectable people it is a testament to his single minded courage that in this more enlightened day and age we are able to play poker in our cosy environments without risking harassment social ostracism or eternal damnation
2411384 it was humiliating and i was utterly ashamed but as soon as my ex husband did that i knew i had to leave him thepokerweb com all rights reserved
2411385 their direct response to the foia request was we dont have a list despite transcripts from public meetings indicating that they do have a list and that theyre developing this list all the time
2411386 you know the overhead of having to process all that is huge the services that we have to purchase that filter and hunt for spam thats money that could have been spent on something else the storage space for all of that when it comes in even temporarily costs the university in terms of equipment
2411387 i i ive ill i mine me i was jogging one day and i happened to run into this guy and he was telling me about this new company i have an assistant
2411388 i have no knowledge from any source regarding the validity of any question regarding the trade of manny ramirez

2411407 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2411408 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2411415 this restaurant served up a wonderful dinner for me and the ladies on friday night
2411416 dude i expected so much more from this review it didnt speak to how great and authentic the ambiance was is actual vietnamese music playing is key to say and that you ate with someone who ordered in vietnamese is a significant note to add adds to the authenticity you can say that i was your mail order bride if you like

2411452 there may be a political downside to obamas charisma that has nothing to do with snarky mccain tv spots linking him to britney spears and paris hilton
2411453 there comes in politics a moment where what was once exhilarating a presidential nominee who is the hopeful embodiment of 21st century america becomes predictable and commonplace
2411454 basically tied with his opponent when his party is so far ahead
2411455 there is a sense that because of his unique background and temperament obama lives apart
2411456 as a result voters have trouble placing him in his context understanding the roots and values in which he is ineluctably embedded
2411457 had colin powell run with his military background and other experience he would not have had the same problems persuading undecided voters that obama has faced
2411458 recent history suggests that the electorate swings late not early as undecided voters slowly carefully and fairly rationally begin to make up their minds
2411459 right now the type of voter whos paying attention is primed to support
2411460 after the conventions when younger voters typically tune in and by younger here i mean under 55 or so then obamas margins will widen because these folks are his folks
2411461 i look at the code and i want to cry
2411462 1 000 per person then rose to 5 000 per couple and 10 000 per couple those who gave 10 000 got to have their photos taken with bush

2411464 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent

2411467 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2411468 just because the perception of some people is that content should be free doesnt make it correct
2411469 that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others
2411470 one more example of the significant ongoing trend for electronic technologies to add words to the language
2411471 are there any stories of smaller more domestic changes that could have changed the world or are they all politics and technology

2411629 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
2411630 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
2411631 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
2411632 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
2411633 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2411634 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2411644 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
2411645 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
2411646 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
2411647 o prophet tell your wives and daughters and the believing women to draw their outer garments around them when they go out or are among men that is better in order that they may be known to be muslims and not annoyed

2411654 i enjoy the freedom to be able to dress in less constricting attire
2411655 somewhere the guys in pink floyd are slapping their foreheads and saying mammoths
2411656 what we feel modest wearing today would have scandalized brigham young what we wear to the swimming pool would horrify us if we wore it to church
2411657 rather than diffusing lust clothing creates it we make certain parts of our bodies more mysterious more alluring that heightens sexual awareness
2411658 but i am constantly at risk of going to jail for it
2411659 no 53 saying ill pray for you and then not
2411660 i really believe its the most important thing i did in my teaching career
2411661 our turnover among teachers and administrators is so frequent in this state

2411666 students may have underreported their sexual experiences out of fear of the honor code or a sense of shame or embarrassment
2411667 but even so the percent is remarkably lower than the 60 to 70 percent average on other campuses
2411668 there is just as much sex going on at byu as at any other university its just they get married first
2411669 sexual transgression was the most pervasive and persistent problem i had to deal with as a bishop
2411670 i saw it as my calling to help members have a healthy understanding of sexuality it is one of the gifts from loving heavenly parents who are themselves sexual beings
2411671 is just that the sales numbers on the pc are not what they used to be and are not what they are on the consoles

2411688 its great getting back out here having fun and hanging out with my boys
2411689 its just a feeling of a dream come true i feel like im starting all over again
2411690 it was real big it was big for me personally getting on that field and running and getting everything all back
2411691 i kind of wanted to get another series in to run around a little bit more
2411692 im just happy to be out here its a blessing
2411693 they were really working hard out there and going and getting it
2411694 weve all been in training camp for so long our defense knows what were going to do it feels like we were staying the same not moving we werent going forward or backward out here we were moving going forward
2411695 we are excited to have five nationally televised primetime games included among what should be one of our most exciting regular season schedules in recent years
2411696 we have a tremendous home schedule that our fans are really going to enjoy as we defend our afc north title
2411697 myron was a big part of the steelers game day experience for so many years and we want to give our fans the opportunity to show their appreciation for all that he meant to so many people
2411698 i dont want to speculate on the length of time
2411699 ive heard anything from four to six weeks with his status its an unfortunate incident but our approach is that its part of football well regroup and make the necessary adjustments and keep this thing rolling
2411700 the reality is he ended up with the football and tried to make the best of a bad situation made a nice play the competitor in him probably got the best of him and he lowered his shoulder
2411701 it was awesome that the offensive line did such a good job of run blocking
2411702 we ran the ball really well on the touchdown play the eagles came with a cornerback blitz but roethlisberger read it perfectly and quickly got the ball to holmes in the flat after the catch holmes made a move to get away from pro bowl safety brian dawkins and cruise into the end zone
2411703 we didnt want to point it out to let their defensive backs know that we were reading it we were just on the same page read it correctly ben got the ball to me as quickly as possible and i made the play after
2411704 it was big for me personally getting on the field and running and getting everything back its just a feeling of a dream come true i feel like im starting all over again
2411705 the only positive that you can take away is that we held them to a field goal we didnt let them score a touchdown in the red zone but we have a lot of work to do

2411714 the city and i have been in discussions for over a year about the best time to step aside
2411715 i am proud of what we have accomplished for the citizens of edgewood and i will always look back fondly on the time i spent here
2411716 we had always planned to do this at some point near the primary election as we get closer and closer to election day the hours and minutes of each day have become increasingly valuable
2411717 it is imperative that i have enough time to travel throughout the county and take my message to as many voters as possible our sheriffs office faces great challenges but i am confident in our ability to get violent crime under control and provide a safer community for our citizens that is why i am running for sheriff and i look forward to continuing my discussion with the good people of orange county
2411718 the voters in orange county are fed up with the recent increases in crime
2411719 i have spent countless hours traveling the county and presenting my plans for the orange county sheriffs office these straw poll victories have provided great evidence that my message is resonating with the people
2411720 but youll easily be killed by the nazis if you dont say anything or if you say yes and you stand against them
2411721 id rather kill them because if they dont then they can kill me
2411722 you really are incorrigible batman the reason they are good is because they havnt been pushed hard enough all they need is one push
2411723 what was the situation like before there was a government
2411724 so heres what i dont get i honestly dont understand how people in number three can do this how is it possible to believe in something like god yet continue to act and think as if there is no god
2411725 its better to a dissatisfied socrates than a pig satisfied
2411726 ok teacher i dare you to try and teach me something im going to do the least amount of work to get the greatest grade i can get
2411727 because im afraid that if i learn about philosophy of religion i might doubt my own
2411728 but it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg
2411729 the whole concept of human rights has become so massively dependent on imaginative interpretations of the law for example from the right to privacy to the right to abortion that there is little knowing where it might finish up
2411730 if moral consensus is the basis for human rights then the manipulation and coercion of moral belief can produce new rights such as those to abortion euthanasia and the cloning and destruction of human life for research purposes

2411733 considering that a conservative partys candidate has become president these measures are no surprise establishing law and order is a very important mandate for the lee administration
2411734 its a classical conservative approach in which growth is achieved first by establishing internal stability
2411735 its just absurd to think that one can dictate the intellectual choice of others today its a comedy
2411736 this is practical murder of the authors and a declaration of war against the readers who already have read those books
2411737 its standard procedure to forbid reading material considered to be threatening to the healthy spirit of the soldiers
2411738 our analysis suggests that the gesture to donate the books was not done out of pure goodwill but the intention was to spread some bad ideas
2411739 education cant be left in the hands of the korean teachers and education workers union
2411740 its all about an anything but roh approach to virtually all matters that is causing mistakes
2411741 its something embedded so deeply and its not only the president but the inner circle as well selective denial would be much more rational and yield better results

2411746 a tribute by a musician with a sense of history who is trying to push bebop heritage forward
2411747 christian fabian showcases a collection of tunes that draws in listeners and wont let go until the disc comes to an end the masters return is a highly enjoyable disc and is definitely recommended for fans of straight ahead instrumental jazz
2411748 led by bassist fabian is beautifully played and idiomatic the leader is spiritually devoted to the music of dizzy bird and miles as well as to the living masters who learned their craft in musical apprenticeships the cd is the very opposite of the technical excesses that this repertoire provokes in some players fabian may turn out to be one of the new generations masters
2411749 christian fabians band swings easily over this mix of new and classic bop tunes serving them straight up and showing excellent poise fabians fat basslines and upbeat attitude set up several tasty solos leaving pianist mike longo and drummer lewis nash plenty of room to make their own warm statements guest trumpeter jimmy owens and sax man andres boiarsky goose some of the up tempo numbers into a funkier space while the trio casts a golden glow on ballads
2411750 a very professional recording with some fine interpretations of ageless standards with a few outstanding original compositions as a bonus five star playing from the band on all the tracks well done guys
2411751 this is why im so encouraged when i see musicians like bassist fabian is best known for his years in lionel hamptons band a stellar example of fabian once again
2411752 the title may be a bit presumptuous but mike longo lewis nash and leader christian fabian certainly are good enough to qualify as accomplished professionals and the same can be said of the trios guests andres boiarsky on sax and jimmy owens on trumpet
2411753 led by bassist extraordinaire christian fabian once the youngest member of the lionel hampton big band the imaginative fabian zone trio pays tribute to such legends as miles davis dizzy gillespie charlie parker and herbie hancock fabians original compositions fit seamlessly with the jazz classics
2411754 on the new recording by bassist christian fabian each of the talented individuals shine we are talking about the art of jazz improvisation here these are true professionals who know their business so give fabian credit for trying to follow in the footsteps of the best of the best i also like the fact that fabian sticks to acoustic bass on the recording and bows as well as plucks recommended for the adventurous listener
2411755 christian fabian has terrific presence and plays a swinging bass this disc is more then just a terrific straight ahead record a winning straight ahead album full of timeless jazz performed by exceptional musicians 4 stars
2411756 what a no brainer to review a cd project of this quality the band grooves with a strong rhythmic flow and deliver their craft in a gainful harmonic and melodic essence
2411757 fabian leads the group subtly with a lot of good musicianship
2411758 welcome to the world of free wheeling jazz improvisation by the fabian zone trio the musicians are exemplary fabian leads the group subtly and makes his solos appropriate for a bassist not too long or overpowering there is a lot of good musicianship here and the improve all seems to make sense and is refreshing after so much of jazz has been thought out and polished to pop perfection in recent years
2411759 fabian started with a complimentary core of first class musicians in this case pianist mike longo and drummer lewis nash
2411760 another trio of competent jazz musicians playing the jazz they love
2411761 the quality of musicianship is high as the group performs the music of the masters fabian proves there is more than one way of presenting a ballad now thats the zone the masters return makes his point
2411762 this group is more than able to tackle compositions by masters gillespie miles davis charlie parker and herbie hancock
2411763 fabian swings consistently and is so lyrical in his playing that he overcomes any objections i might have had to that much solo bass even his duet with drummer nash is a delight which kind of sums up the entire album strongly recommended
2411764 with strong roots and creative sensitivity the individual talents shine but together they construct a group of great talent
2411765 a hard core improviser surrounding himself with cats like mike longo lewis nash and jimmy owens a tasty set for those that like jazz on the edge this a cutting date in the classic sense essentially a piano trio date with the bass man leading the way you can tell a good time was had by all as this was being laid down hot stuff
2411766 the result is a lively one of a kind jazz album sparkling from the unique dynamic that comes from longtime friends and experts intuitively playing to one anothers strengths highly recommended
2411767 ive experienced the joy of jazz through listening reviewing and deejaying for many years but hardly a month goes by when i do not learn of a new jazz artist whose music impresses me such an artist is bassist christian fabian fabian is a bop and straight ahead devotee theres no pretense here just straight ahead well brewed bebop
2411768 new york city bassist christian fabian puts his bass in the forefront on most of these jazz classics and originals handling the theme alone like a single horn or working in tandem with his partners
2411769 theres swing bebop and lots of cool headed improvisation on this the fabian zone trios third cd
2411770 in fact meatiness may be the best way to describe fabians overall sound whether walking or soloing its his uncompromising tone that keeps the listener engaged with superb performances and creative composing arranging the masters return is a well crafted collection of straight ahead jazz fabians musical vision is at once steeped in tradition and forward thinking
2411771 if youre looking for another jazz improv this one may well be another hit with you
2411772 bassist christian fabian leads his trio through another exciting adventure these arrangements pop this is a happening session
2411773 you can almost see the cigarette smoke languidly curling upwards from the bandstand the dozen tracks on the wonderfully engineered cd are a mixture of originals by band members plus jazz archive classics theres really nothing here not to like the playing is crisp and focused good humored and playful it might be retro sounding but it is also the way jazz should still sound if you like your jazz straight then get this album it will push all your buttons
2411774 former bassist for the lionel hampton band jazzster christian fabian unleashes traditional mind expanding jazz improvisation with his group fabian zone trio and their new cd called the masters return take a listen to this dynamic new recording and decide for yourself but to these ears the improv is solid never too far out but innovative and interesting they stay in the modern be bop pocket and all five musicians shine
2411775 this is an absolutely cracking recording a memorable apt and highly appropriate tribute to the masters of jazz playing of the highest quality is complemented by arrangements and writing to match full marks to all concerned with this sheer class
2411776 another great and exceptional production the presentation of music inside the style and personality reflected in the tracks is very refreshing
2411777 what a great sound you have we have played several of your tracks to date and plan to schedule more in future programs keep up the good work
2411778 your music is just beautiful rich kind and complex sound really great
2411779 absolutely great as previous two albums i fell in love with this musician and his partners excellent
2411780 outstanding music once again if the master ever left he sure has returned
2411781 a great album the only problem is there are so many really good tracks that it is hard to choose which ones to play and then again i cant stop playing your last album as well well done keep up the superb work
2411782 the master return remembers us the big glories of the jazz an atmosphere that the bassist christian fabian knows to recreate very well in classic as bebop milestones or chamaleon it is necessary to say in addition that the accompaniment in the album does not remain behind
2411783 bassist christian fabian has never failed to produce interesting and creative jazz
2411784 theres lots to enjoy here and one must agree wholeheartedly with the quoted review comments on the cd case jazz masters is a title that the fabian zone trio could well share
2411785 well it looks created to me so it must have a creator

2411800 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2411801 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2411802 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2411803 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2411804 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2411851 hemos pedido al equipo que explique por qu tras haber indicado a hamilton que deb a entrar en boxes en la vuelta siguiente informaron a alonso mientras estaba a n en pista que cuando entrase en pits una vuelta m s tarde se quedar a unos 20 segundos
2411852 el equipo explic que frecuentemente da estimaciones a sus pilotos de la duraci n de las paradas en boxes antes de que entren en pits y la raz n por la que el monoplaza estuvo 20 segundos fue porque se estaba llevando a cabo una cuenta atr s previa a su salida en un buen momento respecto a la posici n de otros coches en pista

2411874 its completely within the sacred chants and i know that
2411875 thats why i keep very humble i keep my head bowed
2411876 theres a real magic that happens when we chant these words and i dont question it anymore at times ill sing the translations or be inspired to sing lyrics that relate to the translation but for the most part i just let the sacred chants do their work its kind of a medicine balm a healing balm i believe that we bring these sacred chants to life when we sing them and that these chants have lived for thousands of years before me and will continue to live for years after that
2411877 i was fortunate to grow up in a household where my mom sang the sikh chants every day so i grew to know that hearing and listening and saying the sacred chants would bring me joy and i grew to know that when there were times of challenge i could go to those sacred chants for healing
2411878 growing up in america i went to public schools and generally i was the only sikh child in the whole school but through these experiences of going to india and listening to the sacred music and just feeling the heart and the warmth of the people and learning about the sikh history i gained a real sense of my identity
2411879 it was a really powerful time in my life because i realized how important it is to love yourself and to have that inner connection of love for your own soul and for the light of divinity that is within each of us
2411880 when i got into the studio and experienced making music it was very very healing for me on a personal level and i just had an aha moment an inner discovery of wow this is something i could give to other people because of the great gifts they had given to me
2411881 i really believe in the power of people singing and singing positive affirmations essentially thats what we share with people through the music and through our prayer for peace and its with those positive self affirmations
2411882 art has always had the capacity to bring people together in a unified experience yoga has always had the objective of knowing and mastering the mind we are gesturing toward a future in which art will be used explicitly toward these ends using peoples brainwaves as the medium

2411887 we pour almost endless resources roughly 50 billion every year into catching trying and incarcerating people who primarily harm themselves
2411888 this insane war on drugs damages communities and drains crucial resources from the police courts and prisons these resources could be better used to combat serious street and corporate crime
2411889 nader gonzales would empty prisons of nonviolent drug offenders and fill them up with convicted corporate criminals
2411890 as with alcoholics and nicotine addicts the approach to drug addicts should be rehabilitation not incarceration
2411891 we dont put nicotine addicts in jail we dont put alcoholics in jail they lead to far greater mortality and morbidity than drug addicts
2411892 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
2411893 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2411894 so they had a hearing late at night robin was put into jail and since that point he has been held here in colarado springs in the criminal justice center in el paso county basically just a regular old county jail with all kinds of people dangerous criminals many of them and its a difficult place to be but robins in good spirits and were now dealing with the consequences of his action in the military courts here
2411895 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2411896 if i tell the iraqi police or the sons of iraq they will tell the wrong people and i will be killed i dont trust them if i tell the americans theyll tell no one how they found about the grenades
2411897 when the sois sons of iraq stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2411898 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire costs of that program
2411899 the u s military was supposed to be out of the employment business by now when it introduced the sons of iraq initiative last year senior commanders expected the local security personnel to be hired gradually into the ranks of the iraqi army and police but iraqs shiite dominated central government has balked at the idea of bringing so many young sunni men including many onetime militants into the countrys fledging security forces less than 20 of the roughly 103 000 sons of iraq had been given government jobs as of early june that has left u s forces responsible for employing and paying the iraqis
2411900 the national front and other onetime insurgent groups will join a bitter struggle for power between established sunni politicians of the iraqi islamic party and upstart leaders of the sahwa or awakening council a u s backed tribal alliance whose popularity has grown following its success in combating the group al qaeda in iraq entering the elections is to change the current reality in our area the domination of the sunni spectrum by the iraqi islamic party said effan al issawi the top awakening commander in falluja they are unworthy of leading the sunnis
2411901 i believe i have something okay we continue to urge the council of representatives to seek a compromise that can be adopted promptly we regret that the iraqi parliament adjourned yesterday without finishing its work on a local elections law the parliamentarians have made great strides towards finishing the closing agreement on most of the more difficult issues we recognize that the election law brought to the floor important questions regarding the status of kirkuk the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the eleciton law the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2411902 my understanding is that theyre continuing i dont have anything particular to say about the process right now we havent discussed those publicly before im not going to here as we said well provide you with details when we get through with this
2411903 i would not be prepared to provide a timeline for that
2411904 shiite militia leader muqtada al sadr stepped back into iraqs political fray friday with an offer that if genuine washington would be hard pressed to refuse set a timetable for withdrawal of u s troops from iraq and the mahdi army will begin to disband the main reason for the armed resistance is the american miltiary presence said sadr emissary salah al ubaidi who spoke to reporters in najaf friday if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2411905 was one of the main reasons that violence in iraq has dropped to the lowest levels in four years for both civilians and trooops
2411906 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2411907 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
2411908 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
2411909 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
2411910 come on we can have a better country we can change this around

2411919 thinking back now i suppose you were just stating your views what was it all for for the weather or the battle of agincourt and the times that we all hoped would last like a train they have gone by so fast and though we stood together at the edge of the platform we were not moved by them with my own hands when i make love to your memory its not the same i miss the thunder i miss the rain and the fact that you dont understand casts a shadow over this land but the sun still shines from behind it thanks all the same but i just cant bring myself to answer your letters its not your fault but your honesty touches me like a fire the polaroids that hold us together will surely fade away like the love that we spoke of forever on st swithins day

2411947 lament and cry about the abominations of the children of israel
2411948 when you see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests the levites bearing it then you shall set out from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure do not come near it that you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way before
2411949 sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you
2411950 neither do i condemn you go and sin no more
2411951 i am the bread of life eat me and you shall never be hungry
2411952 let those who have charge over the city draw near each with a deadly weapon in his hand
2411953 go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it
2411954 go after him through the city and kill do not let your eye spare nor have any pity 6 utterly slay old and young men maidens and little children and women but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary
2411955 defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain go out
2411956 ah lord god will you destroy all the remnant of israel in pouring out your fury on jerusalem
2411957 the iniquity of the house of israel and judah is exceedingly great and the land is full of bloodshed and the city full of perversity for they say the lord has forsaken the land and the lord does not see 10 and as for me also my eye will neither spare nor will i have pity but i will recompense their deeds on their own head
2411958 there was a certain rich man who had a steward and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods 2 so he called him and said to him what is this i hear about you give an account of your stewardship for you can no longer be steward
2411959 then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my master is taking the stewardship away from me i cannot dig i am ashamed to beg 4 i have resolved what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses
2411960 so he called every one of his masters debtors to him and said to the first how much do you owe my master
2411961 and i say to you make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon that when you fail c they may receive you into an everlasting home
2411962 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon
2411963 he who sows the good seed is the son of man
2411964 which i am and still exist as and always will exist as
2411965 which i am and currently exist as and will always exist as
2411966 yes they do have big houses and money but they dont have me my son you may not have certain things right now but you have me
2411967 for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance
2411968 but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them
2411969 whosoever hath not even what he has will be taken away
2411970 well how come so many unbelievers out there are so prosperous
2411971 lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and convert and i shall heal them
2411972 i know that there will be a chance to speak about this but for now i will focus on other things
2411973 i am forgiven so it does not matter what i do
2411974 well god loves me so i dont care what you think about me and i dont care if what i do is a stumbling block for you
2411975 i am free to do and be a part of anything i want and if i do something wrong i can always confess and be forgiven and all is well
2411976 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself
2411977 if your brother sins against you a go and show him his fault just between the two of you if he listens to you you have won your brother over 16 but if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses b 17 if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector
2411978 woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
2411979 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god
2411980 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
2411981 and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
2411982 thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts is his name if those ordinances depart from before me saith the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever
2411983 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
2411984 to those who seek him to those who love him to those who obey him to those who walk in righteousness to those who walk in the spirit to those believe
2411985 mi percepci n es que creo que los medios de alg n modo nos est n invitando a decir a nosotros lo que muchos est n creyendo en la sociedad y no pueden decirlo pero me parece que un poco darle lugar a la impresi n de este malestar que estamos teniendo todos porque en realidad est n ocurriendo cosas muy graves en el mbito de la justicia que no tienen que ver estrictamente con lo que deciden los jueces o los fiscales
2411986 a veces tiene que ver con otros cuerpos que intervienen como por ejemplo el cuerpo m dico forense que por otro lado tambi n es importante que todo el mundo sepa que el cuerpo m dico forense ha sido intervenido desde los mbitos m s elevados de la justicia por la inoperancia del cuerpo m dico forense
2411987 en el caso nuestro se tomaron 8 meses para realizar una pericia m dica todo eso habla que toda la justicia est en tela de juicio
2411988 mi sensaci n es que estas preguntas que nos hacen de alg n modo es como para provocar una respuesta de nuestra parte que de alg n modo alimente esta representaci n que vamos teniendo todos y que la justicia tiene que ser mirada con mucha dureza porque en realidad lo que vamos viendo est sucediendo permanentemente

2412193 nella quale ho cercato di spiegare le ragioni che mi portano a lasciare litalia dei valori e ad aderire al partito democratico
2412194 in questi giorni ho vissuto una profonda contraddizione tra alcune mie convinzioni e le posizioni che sta assumendo il partito avrei voluto una piu netta presa di distanze dalle parole pronunciate contro il presidente della repubblica contro il partito democratico e da cattolico praticante quale sono contro il papa la rottura che si sta profilando tra idv e pd prosegue touadi non e affatto un bene per questo paese e sono fermamente convinto che lalleanza con il partito democratico sia imprescindibile per me una rottura totale con veltroni non e sostenibile politicamente esisto perche lui mi ha voluto al comune di roma lo stimo gli voglio bene e pur non risparmiandogli alcune critiche considererei per la mia coerenza sleale oltre che sbagliato politicamente fare nei prossimi mesi campagna contro di lui e il pd palesemente o sotto traccia la forte impressione che ho riguardo unulteriore aggravio della situazione dei rapporti tra pd e idv mi spinge a fare una scelta mi auguro che le motivazioni che mi spingono a compiere un gesto cosi forte conclude touadi possano essere comprese e faro di tutto perche il mio rapporto con litalia dei valori possa continuare ad essere leale e proficuo per il bene del nostro paese
2412195 touadi ha detto veltroni era stato candidato in una lista che si era impegnata a fare un gruppo unitario col pd e avendo visto che questo non si e fatto
2412196 posti di fronte allalternativa tra stare con grillo o con il pd ha aggiunto quelli che volevano stare nel gruppo unitario devono aver sentito una certa sofferenza
2412197 touadi sostiene che una rottura totale con veltroni non e sostenibile aggiunge ma io vorrei ricordargli che tra idv e pd non e in atto nessuna rottura e che a proposito della manifestazione di piazza navona il presidente di pietro si e subito dissociato dagli attacchi contro il papa contro il presidente della repubblica e contro il pd
2412198 forse touadi conclude pedica cercava solo la scusa per abbandonare il partito e mi viene il dubbio che la lettera indirizzata al presidente di pietro sia stata scritta a quattro mani e meditata come scelta dei tempi domani i nostri giovani a bellaria capiranno cosa vuol dire oltre la legalita anche la parola lealta e rispetto
2412199 un caloroso benvenuto a jean l onard touadi nel nostro gruppo
2412200 la sua adesione al pd sottolinea soro un fatto politico importante che premia il nostro modo di fare opposizione una opposizione ferma coerente e non subalterna sempre rispettosa di tutte le istituzioni il disagio che lo ha mosso a fare questa scelta ci conferma nella linea che abbiamo fin qui seguito
2412201 sono sicuro conclude soro che il nostro gruppo sapr valorizzare le qualit politiche e umane di una personalit come touad che ha gi dato buona prova di s come assessore al comune di roma

2412254 ma ero convinto di avere presentato ricorso al giudice di pace vicendolo
2412255 quando sono andato a pagare il ballo dello scooter ha detto ho fatto la sgradevole scoperta di avere circolato con il mezzo sottoposto a fermo amministrativo nonostante avessi vinto il ricorso nessuno mi aveva informato di questo provvedimento in sostanza ho circolato a mio rischio e pericoloso perch il mezzo non era in sostanza assicurato per il fermo amministrativo
2412256 e necessaria una maggiore attenzione da parte di chi mette a ruolo e in pagamento queste cartelle
2412257 lelevata mole dei ricorsi presentati a fine anno avra costi sociali enormi e blocchera gli uffici giudiziari un caos che non ha precedenti in nessun paese e che puo essere risolto solo annullando tutte le contravvenzioni elevate nel corso del 2008
2412258 e assurdo emettere cartelle per multe regolarmente pagate dallinteressato dice paielli ci sono capitati non un solo caso ma il 20 dei 150 ricorsi al giudice di pace pure chi ha regolarmente pagato la multa non ha altra scelta che appunto ricorrere al giudice di pace
2412259 sono off limits per i consumatori a chi chiede documentazione delle notifiche precisa paielli delle cartelle si risponde nei casi migliori non li abbiamo se non noi non possiamo esibirli
2412260 non ha altra via che il ricorso al giudice di pace
2412261 chi paga ed amaramente errori disguidi e mancanza di comunicazione tra gli uffici pubblici e il consumatore indifeso
2412262 la violazione quando e possibile deve essere immediatamente contestata tanto al trasgressore quanto alla persona che sia obbligata in solido al pagamento della somma dovuta

2412343 una prassi iniqua e penalizzante per i risparmiatori e per le imprese
2412344 molte banche si sono ostinatamente attardate in una prassi che noi riteniamo elusiva della legge che impone la portabilit dei mutui senza oneri per i risparmiatori
2412345 sono nulle le clausole di massimo scoperto e le clausole comunque denominate che prevedono una remunerazione accordata alla banca indipendentemente dalla effettiva durata del prelevamento della somma
2412346 salvo che il corrispettivo per il servizio di messa a disposizione delle somme sia predeterminato unitamente al tasso debitorio
2412347 il corrispettivo pagato dal cliente per compensare lintermediario dellonere di dover essere sempre in grado di fronteggiare lutilizzo oltre il fido accordato sul conto corrente
2412348 la metodica impiegata per ottenere la massima remunerazione si realizzava applicando in maniera abnorme la commissione di massimo scoperto la quale non altro che un mero aumento del costo del denaro svincolato da qualsiasi prestazione in concreto fornita dal mutuante e quindi da considerarsi semplice
2412349 spetta esclusivamente alle singole banche definire i rapporti con la clientela

2412451 tutte le assemblee si sono espresse in maniera univoca dicono i segretari regionali maurizio fabbri spi cgil franco andrini fnp cisl e luigi pieraccini uilp uil occorre intensificare a tutti i livelli la contrattazione sociale per tutelare i diritti e il reddito dei pensionati
2412452 sconcertante e umiliante perch scardina i principi costituzionali di uno stato sociale moderno fondato sui diritti e sulla solidariet e non sulla carit
2412453 linflazione reale almeno il doppio aggiungono i segretari di spi cgil fnp cisl e uilp uil questa unulteriore conferma del fatto che il governo non ha nessuna intenzione di affrontare seriamente e in modo strutturale le condizioni dei redditi dei pensionati e dei lavoratori ma il sindacato non pu accettare un altro anno di forte perdita del potere dacquisto non pu esserci sviluppo e futuro per il nostro paese se continueranno a regredire i diritti fondamentali
2412454 in attesa delle decisioni finali del governo nazionale su sanit e assistenza dicono fabbri andrini e pieraccini registriamo una netta inversione di tendenza sulla spesa sociale rispetto a quanto contenuto nella finanziaria precedente al momento sono scomparsi il fondo sociale nazionale e il fondo per la non autosufficienza ed gi chiarissimo che la sanit pubblica subir forti tagli
2412455 non sono cambiati i bisogni che nel 2006 hanno portato allistituzione del fondo per la non autosufficienza precisano fabbri andrini e pieraccini per questo esigiamo lintera somma indicata nellaccordo che prevede 311 milioni di euro da rivalutare ogni anno e dal 2009 altri 100 milioni derivanti dalladdizionale regionale irpef e irap
2412456 sar un confronto non facile anche in considerazione degli effetti ancora incerti della modifica della tassazione ici concludono i segretari dei pensionati di certo ci batteremo per impedire riduzioni dei servizi o rincari insostenibili

2412609 non sono una persona esperta in materie finanziarie e ho solo due lire messe via spiega anna maria de luca impiegata 56 anni un figlio di 33 prestatrice di zopa non so se dal punto di vista del guadagno il mio investimento di 6 000 euro andr bene per sto gi cominciando a ricevere i primi frutti trovo gratificante vedere che questa cosa gi funziona e se ne possa verificare landamento giorno per giorno sul sito al contrario tempo fa ho investito in un fondo che sta andando malissimo e nessuno sa darmi informazioni adeguate su cosa fare o semplicemente su chi devo chiamare penso che prima o poi me ne tirer fuori a costo di perdere tutti e 3 000 euro
2412610 avevo acquistato azioni enel con la privatizzazione con mia sorella sono tuttora in perdita di almeno il 10 20 per cento di zopa mi ha attratto la filosofia innovativa mi piace lidea di prestare senza intermediazione bancaria
2412611 mi piaciuta lidea di questi prestiti on line senza lutilizzo di finanziarie o banche come apprezzo la possibilit di poter investire anche a breve termine in passato avevo fatto unassicurazione sulla vita che si era rivelato per un impegno eccessivo prolungato negli anni
2412612 ho prestato 9 000 euro su zopa dice andrea rodolico 33 anni imprenditore informatico di asti soprattutto perch mi fa piacere che attraverso i miei investimenti ci siano persone che non debbano sottostare alle banche io lho fatto ai tempi della bolla internet stato seguendo i suggerimenti di alcuni intermediari che ho lasciato un po di sangue sulla pareti da allora non mi fido un granch delle banche agiscono solo a loro vantaggio mi fido invece delle persone alle quali ho prestato i miei soldi lonest molto pi diffusa di quello che si vede nei giornali
2412613 c un concetto di base sociale osserva stefano scardovi 36 anni commerciante si va oltre i meri numeri sapere che ho aiutato qualcuno che voleva sposarsi mi d pi soddisfazione che un fondo che magari investe in aziende che producono armi
2412614 prestare il mio danaro su zopa per me un modo di smobilizzare il danaro che altrimenti sarebbe fermo in banca a interessi zero le banche purtroppo non sono enti di beneficenza cercano di ottenere il massimo dai correntisti dando il meno possibile dice fabio grande 36 anni programmatore presso una software house di torino ad oggi le alternative per guadagnare qualche soldo sono poche a parte investire in borsa come ho fatto io ma i rendimenti ultimamente non solo solo decaduti di pi gi tanto che non ci siano perdite zopa non mi render ricco ma investire i miei soldi cos mi rende certo pi che investirli in banca o tenerli nel materasso
2412615 sono sistemi diversi boober e zopa si basano sulla fiducia una banca non pu permetterselo ha bisogno di garanzie
2412616 gestisco fondi dinvestimento alle generali spiega e ho preferito chiedere il prestito di 10 000 euro che mi serviva per un impianto di pannelli solari su boober per via del tasso particolarmente conveniente 8 a 36 mesi per non so se presterei a mia volta del denaro credo che sia sinceramente un po rischioso
2412617 mi serviva per affrontare delle cure mediche e le condizioni mi sono sembrate molto pi leali quando ho fatto la mia richiesta gli utenti di boober hanno aperto un forum e cos sono emersi alcuni prestatori disponibili mi sono sembrati decisamente pi disponibili rispetto a una banca
2412618 volevo completare il giardino mi servivano 5 000 euro sul taeg offerto da zopa cera una differenza di quattro punti con le banche
2412619 mi servivano 7 000 euro per un impianto di pannelli solari attraverso zopa sono arrivati subito nel giro di un paio di giorni una procedura pratica e veloce
2412620 mi servivano 2 000 euro per estinguere una morosit con il mio condominio e avevo difficolt a ottenerli da banche e finanziarie perch sono una precaria lavoro nel telemarketing con contratti di collaborazione a progetto della durata massima di sei mesi e questo mi rende una categoria c a rischio invece gli zopiani mi hanno dato fiducia ci siamo stretti la mano virtualmente il prestito mi stato erogato in tempi rapidissimi e io adesso cerco di pagare le rate anche prima della scadenza grazie a loro dormo sonni tranquilli ho evitato di affidarmi agli usurai

2412642 seppure in un contesto largamente negativo in cui rientra anche l intervento beffa sui mutui continua il deputato pd registriamo un aspetto positivo frutto della nostra iniziativa e stato infatti ripristinato il fondo a sostegno delle famiglie che attraversano difficolt economiche e non hanno temporaneamente la possibilit di pagare le rate nella scorsa finanziaria era stata inserita la possibilit di sospendere le rate fino a 18 mesi senza oneri per le famiglie stesse il fondo di 20 milioni previsto per il 2008 in un primo tempo era stato soppresso e oggi con soddisfazione lo ritroviamo nel maxi emendamento

2412684 con le novit stabilite dal decreto 112 in favore dei contribuenti in tema di debiti con lerario afferma equitalia dovr subito sospendere tutte le procedure espropriative e vendite della case allasta disposte con parametri e valori oramai illegittimi si tratta di un bel passo in avanti ma sono consapevole che resta ancora molto da fare per ristabilire un rapporto di fiducia tra contribuente ed istituzioni e per veder applicati i giusti principi di correttezza trasparenza e buona fede da parte dellagente della riscossione tributi

2412691 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2412692 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2412693 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2412694 barang siapa bertakwa kepada allah niscaya akan diberi jalan keluar dari setiap urusannya dan diberi rizki dari arah yang tak diduga dan barang siapa yang bertawakal kepada allah niscaya akan dicukupi segala kebutuhannya
2412695 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2412696 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2412697 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2412698 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2412699 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2412750 liniziativa viene incontro a quelle famiglie che si sono trovate in difficolt con il pagamento delle rate del mutuo dopo i rialzi dei tassi di interesse decisi dalla bce dalla fine del 2005
2412751 ho stipulato un mutuo in data 29 dicembre 2005 di euro 167 000 euro di cui la prima rata iniziale era di 840 euro
2412752 sono andata subito alla mia banca dopo avere letto della convenzione del governo
2412753 ma purtroppo il mio mutuo cartolarizzato e mi hanno detto che devo chiuderlo e aprirne un altro magari a tasso fisso
2412754 i mutuatari devono essere consapevoli che ci che non viene pagato nella rata dovr essere pagato a fine mutuo caricato degli interessi
2412755 il provvedimento che riguarda i mutui inserito nel decreto legge sugli interventi in materia economica approvato dal consiglio dei ministri potrebbe consentire ai consumatori di risparmiare sullimporto della rata mensile
2412756 e opportuno e un provvedimento di cui cera bisogno e non restringe il mercato ma lo allarga
2412757 sollievo agli intrappolati con il salario fisso gli istituti di credito hanno mostrato attenzione
2412758 liniziativa viene incontro alle famiglie una conferma del nostro impegno per contribuire alla ripresa del paese
2412759 il conto accessorio nel quale le banche faranno pagare gli interessi alle famiglie per lallungamento del loro mutuo
2412760 da un sollievo immediato ai cittadini che poi pero non sanno per quanti anni in piu dovranno pagare
2412761 su di un conto accessorio maggiorato di uno spread dello 0 50 su base semestrale anche se il governo dice che e annuale
2412762 il consumatore non sa quanto gli durera il mutuo finche non arriva fino in fondo
2412763 un comma della finanziaria scorsa dove le famiglie in difficolta nella restituzione del mutuo potevano sospendere le rate per 18 mesi senza alcun aggravio perche gli interessi li avrebbe pagati lo stato
2412764 grazie alla costituzione di un fondo di solidarieta di 20 milioni di euro poi cancellato da tremonti per finanziare lazzeramento dellici sulla prima casa
2412765 non si tratta di unoperazione a costo zero ma di un ulteriore prestito che listituto di credito concede al cliente con lapertura di un conto accessorio dove viene accreditata la differenza un conto che allunghera la rata del mutuo
2412766 con lapplicazione della convenzione ad un mutuo di 150 mila euro a sei anni dalla stipula e con 14 anni ancora di decorso con lattuale situazione dei tassi il conto accessorio alla fine delle rate salir ad oltre 25 mila euro pari ad una ulteriore dilazione di 26 mesi
2412767 maturare ulteriori interessi sugli interessi causando quindi un ingente esborso supplementare per il cittadino
2412768 si tratta di un pacchetto di misure volte a correggere le iniquita introdotte dai tagli indiscriminati di tremonti che non fanno altro che aumentare le differenze tra il nord e il sud del paese tra occupati e non tra chi possiede una casa e chi e in affitto tra maschi e femmine tra lavoratori pubblici e privati tra chi e ai margini della societa e chi e integrato
2412769 ancora il caso di subire i meccanismi di rimborso alla francese
2412770 i mutui a tasso variabile per tutta la durata del mutuo stipulati o accollati anche a seguito di frazionamento fino a tutto il 28 maggio 2008 e finalizzati allacquisto costruzione e ristrutturazione della prima casa
2412771 la riduzione delle rate del mutuo da corrispondere a partire quanto meno dal terzo mese successivo
2412772 fate attenzione consumatori state spendendo troppo e presto la pagherete
2412773 quando lo stipulai nel 2003 segu tutta la pratica mia mamma quindi colpa mia le dissero che non cera neppure la possibilit di fare il fisso si doveva fare solo il variabile bene stipulato il mutuo pagavo una rata di 890 mensili oggi la medesima rata di quasi 1100 mensili

2412783 seppure in un contesto largamente negativo in cui rientra anche l intervento beffa sui mutui continua il deputato pd registriamo un aspetto positivo frutto della nostra iniziativa e stato infatti ripristinato il fondo a sostegno delle famiglie che attraversano difficolt economiche e non hanno temporaneamente la possibilit di pagare le rate nella scorsa finanziaria era stata inserita la possibilit di sospendere le rate fino a 18 mesi senza oneri per le famiglie stesse il fondo di 20 milioni previsto per il 2008 in un primo tempo era stato soppresso e oggi con soddisfazione lo ritroviamo nel maxi emendamento

2412818 ce una domanda precisa che va rivolta veltroni quale dicastero nellipotizzato governo del pd e stato promesso al dottor calearo non vorremo che fosse quello elle finanze dopo aver lanno scorso dichiarato di condividere lo sciopero fiscale promosso dalla lega oggi il ottor calearo dileggia vincenzo visco che ha avuto il merito el governo prodi di condurre la lotta contro levasione iscale e che come ricompensa non e stato nemmeno ricandidato ci dica allora con chiarezza se tra le aperture al mondo industriale che veltroni vanta ce anche quella di ondividere con berlusconi accanto a numerosi altri punti del programma la tolleranza verso gli evasori
2412819 altro che partito del lavoro per fortuna che c qualcuno che dice la verit calearo oggi su il riformista rivela una verit diamantina e lo dice papale papale tra veltroni e montezemolo non ci sono differenze
2412820 veltroni condivide il giudizio espresso ieri a ballaro da massimo calearo capolista del pd in veneto che ha lodato mastella per aver fatto cadere il governo prodi
2412821 e bene che gli italiani lo sappiano il candidato osannato dai dirigenti del pd ha aggiunto bonelli usa lo stesso linguaggio di berlusconi le sue dichiarazioni rappresentano la degenerazione del sistema politico che non ha piu regole ne punti di riferimento e che non sa cosa e la coerenza
2412822 coerenza ha concluso bonelli dimostrata certamente da calearo nelle parole che ha sempre detto e ripetuto sulla battaglia per lo sciopero fiscale gli attacchi al sindacato e il ricorso alla maggiore precarizzazione del lavoro chi invece non affatto coerente e il pd che sta proponendo una ricetta contro i lavoratori
2412823 questa volta veltroni ha esagerato con il suo ma anche per dimostrare che lui sta con gli operai
2412824 per dimostrare che lui e di sinistra ma anche sostiene castelli di destra si e detto favorevole alla castrazione chimica e a iniziative d urgenza in materia di sicurezza veltroni proviene dal partito delle tasse in quanto compagno di partito di visco ma anche sta con chi vuol fare la protesta fiscale
2412825 veltroni prosegue castelli nellelenco e a favore degli immigrati ma anche di certe ordinanze dei sindaci della lega si schiera dalla parte dei cattolici ma anche con i radicali
2412826 con le sue prese di posizione veltroni conclude castelli sta disorientando tutto il suo elettorato

2412908 labi ha definito un procedura di collaborazione interbancaria volta a contribuire alla migliore realizzazione delle operazioni di portabilit del mutuo improntata a criteri di massima riduzione dei tempi degli adempimenti e dei costi connessi la procedura interviene solo nella fase esecutiva di unoperazione di portabilit ovvero a valle del processo di scelta effettuato dal cliente

2412955 the movie industry has been pushing the envelope and a lot of young ladies feel to be popular thats what they should wear
2412956 the fashion industry markets what sells they make it very difficult for moms who want to find their daughters a decent dress
2412957 i really think it helps just by having an enforcer there and knowing if they came in with the wrong kind of dress someone is going to make it appropriate

2412975 pattuire la variazione senza spese delle condizioni del contratto di mutuo in essere mediante scrittura privata anche non autenticata
2412976 comporta il trasferimento del contratto di mutuo esistente alle condizioni stipulate tra il cliente e la banca subentrante con lesclusione di penali o altri oneri di qualsiasi natura
2412977 non possono essere imposte al cliente spese o commissioni per la concessione del nuovo mutuo per listruttoria e per gli accertamenti catastali
2412978 sia la legge bersani che la finanziaria stabiliscono espressamente che in caso di surroga nessuna spesa pu essere a carico del cliente vero che il notaio necessario per trasferire lipoteca tra la vecchia banca e quella subentrante ma tale spesa deve essere gestita dalla banca che acquisisce il cliente in tutto ci sarebbe stato utile specificare che tra gli oneri inammissibili rientrano anche quelli notarili
2412979 allungare oggi la durata del mutuo ha come effetto immediato la riduzione della rata mensile ma significa pagare complessivamente di pi alla fine del piano di ammortamento
2412980 prolungare di 10 anni la durata di un mutuo decennale lasciando invariato il tasso al 5 per cento abbatte subito la rata da 1 060 a 660 euro in cambio di una riduzione mensile di 400 euro per si finisce per pagare al termine del prestito oltre 31mila euro in pi di interessi
2412981 la soluzione pi adatta a chi oltre al prestito immobiliare ha acceso anche altri finanziamenti perch consente di riunire i diversi rimborsi in ununica rata
2412982 se la surroga fosse gi una realt non sarebbe pi necessario ricorrere alla sostituzione
2412983 i rimproveri del governatore di bankitalia mario draghi che in una lettera ha stigmatizzato i comportamenti illegali degli istituti di credito in merito ai costi sulla portabilita dei mutui la surroga e la cancellazione dellipoteca se non accompagnati da dure sanzioni e da congrui risarcimenti dei danni a favore di 3 2 milioni di famiglie sono fumo negli occhi
2412984 deve inviare immediate ispezioni tese a quantificare con un monitoraggio le illegalita ed i comportamenti truffaldini e fraudolenti che hanno arrecato gravissimo nocumento a milioni di famiglie gia alle prese con aumenti medi sulle rate di 180 euro al mese

2412993 its always the beatles and i think it comes down to please please me
2412994 we associate music with every stage of being a young person
2412995 it seems like at every stage of being young music is there to provide the soundtrack im not thats true of adulthood im not sure what the soundtrack of adulthood is like i think we come to associate music itself with just being young and innocent
2412996 theres certainly accounts of adults with dementia who are able to recite songs perfectly but have lost the ability to speak

2413088 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
2413089 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

2413171 were open minded about a lot of things but not this
2413172 she can go to any college she wants except usc
2413173 i think it was actually philosophy or something like that
2413174 wait i would believe you if you said satans human minions went there but i dont believe that satan actually went there
2413175 imagine if we could just get down there and take a dip in the stream i bet its cold too
2413176 you can go down there and skinny dip but you can only do so after 7 30pm
2413177 what skinny dipping youre joking this is a golf course where theres golf rules and etiquette to adhere to even your golf attire must be proper how could you strip then
2413178 oh so does that mean we can also play golf naked after 7 30pm
2413179 its not the gadgets fault its the donkey using the gadget
2413180 such a boring game man walk then you hit then you walk some more and then you hit and after that you reach a tiny hole and you try to put that tiny ball into the hole whats the fun in that
2413181 what is so great about golf ah all i see is you hitting the ball with those clubs doesnt even look hard
2413182 no way im going to use that stinking glove please

2413184 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
2413185 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
2413186 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
2413187 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
2413188 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
2413189 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
2413190 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
2413191 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
2413192 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
2413193 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
2413194 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
2413195 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
2413196 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
2413197 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
2413198 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
2413199 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
2413200 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
2413201 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
2413202 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
2413203 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
2413204 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
2413205 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
2413206 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
2413207 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
2413208 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
2413209 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
2413210 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
2413211 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
2413212 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
2413213 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
2413214 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
2413215 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
2413216 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
2413217 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
2413218 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
2413219 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
2413220 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
2413221 in order to defeat your evil villain you only need remember this every problem can be solved with sufficient explosives
2413222 i dont think even star jones got this much free crap for her wedding
2413223 exactly the kind of woman id want my daughter to have for a mother in law
2413224 oh i can sleep just a bit longer it is less than a mile to get to work
2413225 awesome the country where hope and change are valid policy positions
2413226 this was the moment when the rising of the seas began to slow and the earth began to heal
2413227 i just see him as the lesser evil i this particular race
2413228 you will never convince me that he is an intelligent man
2413229 immediately jump to the conclusion that iraq was at fault
2413230 les relacions econ miques entre arag les illes balears catalunya i la comunitat valenciana 1995 1998 una aproximaci a trav s del comer de mercaderies
2413231 he ended the iraq war which had been going since 1991
2413232 if the iraq war had been handled properly and ended in 2004 2005 if osama bin laden had been captured im sure people would be saying that george bush was who we needed in this time luck o the draw fellas
2413233 if you dont in 5 to ten years gas will be 5 a gallon
2413234 i can imagine people in 50 or 100 years going you paid how much for a handbag
2413235 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
2413236 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
2413237 thank you sioux city i said it wrong ive been in iowa for too long im sorry
2413238 sen clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas so its not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle
2413239 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma ala because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
2413240 speaking metaphorically about the civil rights movement as a whole
2413241 we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan
2413242 heres something that you will rarely hear from a politician and that is that im not familiar with the hanford uuuuhh site so i dont know exactly whats going on there applause now having said that i promise you ill learn about it by the time i leave here on the ride back to the airport
2413243 then theres the copy of life magazine that obama presents as his racial awakening at age 9 in it he wrote was an article and two accompanying photographs of an african american man physically and mentally scarred by his efforts to lighten his skin in fact the life article and the photographs dont exist say the magazines own historians
2413244 um theres absolutely nothing wrong with that sign right brain
2413245 i dont think so but best not to pipe up or else the loosers will get on your case
2413246 damn it ive told you before its losers you idiot
2413247 british muslim students hold a diverse and broad range of opinions the majority of muslim students have tolerant ideas towards other minorities reject violence in the name of their faith and support britains secular and democratic society as well as its system of governance
2413248 kinda dis respectful to make a joke about someones reliigous book dont you think

2413252 geiler scheiss aber wie gro ist die shisha denn in der realit t

2413254 sorry youre not good enough for me either youre too nice of a person or youre just not attractive enough for anyone to ever consider you you just didnt make the cut now watch me walk away and pretend none of this ever happened while you cry over this incident for the next 5 years
2413255 god am i really that far off are my kids really going to end up on oprah or worse yet jerry springer talking about how their mom really messed them up because she didnt do this or that is it really awful that i want to take a nap this afternoon and not call and check on a friend
2413256 god thank you for my life thank you for this radio ministry and thank you for letting me be a part of it
2413257 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come
2413258 for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints
2413259 whats the deal with aggregators is it a reptile or an efficient online tool
2413260 should be relying more on other students for help and this is a major networking tool that is not being widely used at umass
2413261 metal circus i dont think we should have to rely on other students for help
2413262 the fear of thinking your being too cruel or maybe to kind to someones paper is alleviated by using blogs
2413263 writing as a communication because it is a written text the reader learns something from it and takes the knowledge they already have pertaining to how students have previously guided through the internet they try to interpret it and can critic the written work
2413264 some assignments involved trans class collaboration implying stephs belief in a more communication and dialogue oriented structure rather than just a standard teacher student phenomenon
2413265 however in an intensive writing class like this i think that maybe we should focus a little more on the actual act of writing rather than spending entire class periods learning how to get around the umasswiki website
2413266 the use of the blogs and the wiki creates an ongoing conversation between bloggers
2413267 i know being a introverted person that i would be mortified to have my writings shared with others
2413268 if we cant benefit from feedback in a formal setting now and heavily depend on a response coming from casper then we are not properly preparing ourselves for what the future holds for us for the real world
2413269 barang siapa yang menasabkan dirinya pada selain bapaknya atau mengurus sesuatu yang bukan urusannya maka atas orang tersebut adalah laknat allah malaikat dan seluruh manusia
2413270 barang siapa yang dipanggil dengan nama selain bapaknya maka surga haram atasnya
2413271 wanita manapun yang telah mamasukkan nasabnya pada suatu kaum padahal bukan bagian dari kaum tersebut maka dia terputus dari allah dia tidak akan masuk surga dan laki laki manapun yang menolak anaknya padahal dia mengetahui bahwa anak tersebut anaknya maka allah menghijab diri nya dari laki laki tersebut dan allah akan menelanjangi aibnya dihadapan orang orang yang terdahulu maupun yang kemudian

2413273 it was billed as a celebration and it was a celebration albeit tinged with considerable sadness there was much nostalgic conversation and fond memories recalled
2413274 many of the very best cliftonians have come from polacks as i bolt the doors im sure i will shed a tear
2413275 the contribution of polacks has been in all facets of the school from scholarships to sport to extra curricular and has been a major factor in the schools ethos of tolerance amongst pupils and staff
2413276 the school is desperately keen to maintain its links with the jewish community
2413277 im sad that an institution that has been here for 127 years is closing but other schools have taken its place
2413278 they loaded up their crap and they moved to beverly
2413279 it aint about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can

2413281 there were some rough looking bikers in there beer bellies lots of black leather tattoos beards and the men looked pretty tough too

2413285 the time to begin writing an article is when you have finished it to your satisfaction by that time you begin to clearly and logically perceive what it is that you really want to say

2413290 in manualele de istorie editate in anii 90 ai secolului trecut multi autori cunoscuti au luat apararea criminalilor fascisti cum a fost cazul maresalului roman ion antonescu
2413291 antonescu a dus o politica de pace fata de evrei
2413292 aceasta este o minciuna sustine comunistul victor stepaniuk care s a angajat sa dovedeasca acest lucru
2413293 armata romana sub comanda lui antonescu ar fi ucis pana la 600 000 de evrei
2413294 in ultima vreme in republica moldova locul manualelor cu tenta xenofoba si care iau apararea criminalilor de razboi a fost luat de manuale de compromis
2413295 este extrem de tendentioasa concluziile nu sunt de natura stiintifica iar recomandarile reprezinta de fapt niste lozinci politice
2413296 i didnt really understand this but i thought it was cool
2413297 a newspaper is only as good as its news gatherers it can have the best supervisors and resources but without experienced motivated and reliable journalists who can always meet deadlines it will not achieve its potential
2413298 newspapers accept the principle of the higher duty to inform the community of legal processes
2413299 sometimes defendants who say their lives and reputations will be ruined by publications of their names will make applications to the court

2413343 im having such a difficult time i cant seem to stop my mind from racing i am currently going through a divorce from a very controlling man he has tried every way possible to make my life as well as my 12 yrs old daughters life as miserable as possible
2413344 as a way to mentally physically and emotionally get away from it all i took my daughter to my brothers house in north carolina i figured his huge house on the golf course with its in ground pool and friendly neighbors would be just what my daughter and i needed to find peace of mind
2413345 my brother owns a restaurant and we got to meet all the clientele
2413346 while i was here i met a nice southern gentleman

2413360 she had a bunch of meetings and things planned for fashion week including meetings for her own line but shes postponed everything
2413361 i have no idea why they state went down this road
2413362 all the documents at sequoia interviewed witnesses and came to the conclusion that a crime had been committed
2413363 everything that was done by sequoia was open and public the procedures were the same as sequoia had been following for years
2413364 sequoia had been audited yearly by medi cal and medi cal never said anything was being done wrong
2413365 the government just showing they can do whatever they want
2413366 they dont usually do this when theres just been an accounting confusion or error they are really looking at pervasive and intentional conduct
2413367 when they find it they tend to want to make an example of those defendants because they cant prosecute everybody who might be engaged in this type of fraud
2413368 i cant imagine that an elongated delay or continued disruption at sequoia will be helpful
2413369 the world has never needed mutual understanding mutual toleration and mutual cooperation as much as it does today

2413377 we should have got more than what we got at the end of the day but this is part and parcel of test cricket
2413378 it is important to win sessions and i still feel we are very much in the game if we can have one or two early wickets in the morning
2413379 there was hardly anything for the bowlers nothing for the fast bowlers and nothing for the spinners it is just that we didnt bat well
2413380 they have played enough cricket to analyse what mistakes they are making its important to rectify those mistakes and move ahead and that is what we have to do in the second innings there is one more innings to go which is the most important innings of this series its 1 1 we must be looking forward to the next innings rather than thinking about what has happened today
2413381 they got us slightly back in the game especially after picking up one wicket late in the day they have really got us back in the game
2413382 they were just awesome loving 00 great kids who loved each other

2413387 the meeting suggested immediate initiation of a dialogue that would facilitate the suspension of the agitation and its peaceful resolution

2413397 we have no intention of releasing details that would allow someone to replicate the attacks that can be done
2413398 the mbta official made clear the level of concern reached all the way up to the governors office

2413428 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2413429 a number of western nations and ukraine have sold or donated about 400 tanks armored vehicles 150 artillery weapons and mortars and dozens of combat helicopters to georgia in the past few years the massive deliveries destabilize the regional situation and provoke georgian authorities to resolve conflicts in south ossetia and abkhazia by force
2413430 we have russian tanks moving in we have continuous russian bombardment since yesterday specifically targeting the civilian population
2413431 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2413432 this was a very blunt russian aggression we are right now suffering because we want to be free and we want to be a multiethnic democracy
2413433 is not about georgia anymore its about america its values
2413434 i thought that america stands up for those freedom loving nations and supports them thats what america is all about thats why we look with hope at every american
2413435 they made no secret the are unhappy with our closeness with the united states with the north atlantic treaty organization with the west in general
2413436 we are in this situation of self defense against a big and mighty neighbor we are a country of less than 5 million people and certainly our forces are not comparable

2413445 we have no hesitation in talking to the delegation if these three leaders are kept out of negotiations
2413446 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2413447 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2413448 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2413449 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2413450 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2413451 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2413452 make certain the master slave switch located under the cd adapter board on the drive is set to slave
2413453 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2413454 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2413455 this works for one column but how do i populate the other 4 columns with other results from other queries
2413456 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2413457 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans
2413458 we didnt want to do this construction and tear up the new streets
2413459 were going to make sure for the future we dont have a collision like this again
2413460 centerpoint and downtown merchants both have jobs to do and they should find neutral ground and both work together
2413461 she doesnt have the strong ability that this code of points requires she just has a lot of willpower i dont know where she gets this it comes from inside she is a tiger inside
2413462 this is not just a double front handspring for us its our life
2413463 ive increased my difficulty a lot and gained experience by being at three world championships and winning nine world medals
2413464 you cant compare a woman to a girl dance wise
2413465 you could ask every single person and theyd tell you the exact same thing but when you go into competition that is not your focus you want to do your routines the best you can and score as high you can that way hopefully you can come out on top
2413466 inside the gym im more like my dad and outside im a lot like my mom
2413467 when im not thinking about gymnastics my mom and i have similar personalities in terms of how we think we say the same things at the same time
2413468 they wanted the best for me it wasnt like they were thinking of themselves just to know that its really kind of emotional for me we moved over here with nothing and now we have three successful gyms
2413469 we went to church for russian easter and the priest speaks to people as they leave in russian or english based on how they look
2413470 he spoke to us in english so we said ok thanks i guess we dont look russian any more
2413471 its not so much a russian or american or chinese style as it is my style
2413472 when youve got a little kid you make a sculpture out of them she is absolutely my vision of gymnastics whether you like it or not this is my sculpture right there everything i see in her its what i feel about gymnastics and what i know
2413473 its the little things that make you an amazing gymnast
2413474 anybody can do the big skills its how you make them that separates you
2413475 i dont do a lot of hard skills but i do them in combination
2413476 ive got two releases on bars but i do a lot of pirouettes and turns and connections that set me apart and im always thinking how i can make this turn or that turn closer toward perfection
2413477 it is indescribable to be a coach of a olympian
2413478 but coaching my daughter its a way lot more im proud of her as a gymnast but especially as my daughter i cant even tell you how proud
2413479 i walked in the gym when i was 7 and i havent walked out yet
2413480 gymnastics is a tough sport and gymnasts become strong individuals later on theyre successful in anything they do they face impossibility and overcome it every day when youre done youre ready to be successful i think she will be a very strong woman in that way
2413481 the last couple of months i dont think theres been a better player in baseball
2413482 not just offensively but even defensively he has played outstanding it started probably sometime in june and hes just been red hot
2413483 when you get there its exciting im not trying to push the issue i just want to get there and i got there and am very happy when youre out there every day a lot of things can happen
2413484 i was a little frustrated i gave up the lead for wolfy but the best thing i could do was keep them there and that was my goal after i blew the lead
2413485 patterson is pretty fast and once i hit the ball i felt it was for sure in the gap
2413486 he was closing in fast and when he dove for that ball i was like no ill tell you what when things are working out for you everything happens everything goes your way
2413487 its good when you have a lot of opportunity to play
2413488 i was trying to hit everything to right field e slps i tried to go to center field and right field and hit it hard
2413489 i know that four run inning they had i kind of gave it to them there walking the leadoff guy
2413490 with that bunt play it was definitely an error in my book i threw the ball away and kind of my put myself in a spot where its tough i thought i was going to get out of there with two runs but left a curveball up with phillips
2413491 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2413492 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2413493 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2413494 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2413495 run time is variable it all depends on the outside temperature condition of the grass and the amount of load
2413496 the beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you
2413497 i left a few putts out there but overall it was a very good ball striking round
2413498 what were talking about is making sure we shrink that dependence on those fossil fuels by coming up with alternatives
2413499 as a chinese citizen i feel its the proudest moment of my life
2413500 this is more than a 100 year dream for china to hold these games it is a dream come true
2413501 i hope people can really have an open mind to understand a different culture i really hope they can go to china and take a visit
2413502 a child is just not safe in the yard when a mower is on
2413503 when the mowers running a parent cant hear the child and in some cases with riding mowers they cant see the if the child is behind them
2413504 theyre unstable especially on inclines and if a childs on it with an adult theres always the risk for falling off and sliding under the mower parents always think their child is safe in their lap but thats never the case
2413505 the main thing to remember is all lawn mower injuries are completely preventable
2413506 these arent just freak accidents theyre extremely serious and in most cases they change a childs or an adults life forever
2413507 a meeting of musical minds that begs for a follow up
2413508 my dad was the one who really turned me on to crimson back in the mid 90s when i was listening to a lot of primus and phish i remember spending the better part of one summer just sitting around listening to every recording and reading the fxf and tgd booklets end to end just soaking it all up in addition to absorbing crimson it gave me a reference point to really explore the music of the previous generation
2413509 the most fun ive had with my pants on in a long time

2413522 i greatly appreciate your willingness to share with us your response to what i believe is a shameful situation that you should have never had to experience
2413523 it still is to be seen how it works in america
2413524 many people in the church have believed lies spread by evangelists and christian teachers who have told tales about neo paganism only worthy of grocery store tabloid newspapers the church has sucked up these tales about halloween witches and devils and pastors have believed unsubstantiated and sometimes clearly disproven stories and spread them in their teachings over the last 30 years the result is that we are afraid superstitious and consequently offensive in our actions toward neo pagans
2413525 if our doctrinal stances are so strict as to not allow flex for missional interaction we will most certainly enculturate our message to our own culture and turn it into dogma which is what has occurred with most of american christianity
2413526 the law of christ can make us free and love in the fulfilling of the law

2413609 if you think thats the end then you dont know me very well
2413610 in der vergangenheit hatten wir bereits sehr hohe nachfragen zu unserem ferienprogramm jedoch reduzierte sich die zahl der teilnehmenden kinder oftmals wegen anfallender eintrittsgelder oder fahrtkosten die viele nicht aufbringen konnten
2413611 aus dem spendenaufkommen z b des sponsorenlaufes der heideschulkinder k nnen wir unseren kindern endlich erm igte ferienfreizeit auf dem bauspielplatz und das volle zusatzangebot an f hrungen und besichtigungen g nnen
2413612 you truly believe that this is the right thing i am not the first nor am i the last of my kind the same thing goes for you
2413613 you really dont understand it do you you are a hero you have one task most heroes believe that that task is to vanquish the evil in the world but that just breaks them down strips them of everything your job is to embody the hopes and dreams of innocence not fight you are only a hero because im seen as a villain killing me will end your purpose as a hero and as someone of worth my end will have you slinking back into the depths of nothingness where you came forth from likewise your death will strip me of my influence because i dont have an opposite im only evil because of the view people have on my situation im only evil because they need me to be evil without evil and darkness there is no hope and light nothing to hold to
2413614 the world is built on dichotomies and a zero balance you see you cant have one thing without its opposite you cant understand or see something without a contrast to it there wouldnt be light unless we saw shadows there wouldnt be innocence without guilt there wouldnt be joy without sorrow nor good without evil how could we know what light is if weve never seen its absence
2413615 for every genious there is a moron for every right there is a wrong without a perfect balance these things would overtake the earth and change it into something perfect which cannot allow us to grow and change that is the crux of perfection all things fit perfectly there is no need to try there is no need to fail because there is no need to develop and grow the zero balance keeps the scales in line with each other
2413616 yes you are going to save the world from upheaving itself youre going to save the world from becoming perfect from becoming what its not meant to be youre going to walk away from here find a wife start a family and live your life like it was meant to be lived and im going to continue on with what i am planning because im inexhorably driven to complete this goal even though it will be toppled and become a victim of the unstoppable force of the zero balance i will fall and your place as a hero will be relinquished

2413619 i was sent out to do stories that are underreported
2413620 i think people are very interested in a conversation about race part of it is barack obama part of it is katrina
2413621 especially among young blacks we interviewed who considered themselves leaders they said its time to take the reins and figure out where we go from here
2413622 we question ourselves we look at the stories we are doing
2413623 its detrimental to boys because a father kind of gives you some sort of preview of where youre going
2413624 but for girls it is dangerous because they are enamored with male attention to the degree that theyll do anything to get the love of a man that they should have gotten at home
2413625 but i was also depressed and i didnt know i was depressed because i didnt know about depression but i knew something was wrong with me and i just didnt tell anybody
2413626 there are a couple of things we should look at
2413627 there are a million more black women working today than african american men if employment is a requirement theres already a gap and so we know that exists if education is a requirement thats a gap
2413628 the necessity and the particularity of the assured and believing ones is to be firm in the cause of god and withstand the hidden and evident tests anybody can be happy in the state of comfort ease health success pleasure and joy but if one will be happy and contented in the time of trouble hardship and prevailing disease it is the proof of nobility thanks be to god that that dear servant of god is extremely patient under the disastrous circumstances and in the place of complaining gives thanks

2413632 if there is a sane and intelligent patriotism what exactly does it involve
2413633 the advantage of the part is best to be reached by the advantage of the whole
2413634 unbridled nationalism as distinguished from a sane and legitimate patriotism must give way to a wider loyalty to the love of humanity as a whole
2413635 the earth is but one country and mankind its citizens

2413638 lets get one thing straight race is a socially created concept and since its inception it has been a socially fed nuisance to say the least it sprang to life and run amok lyrics lawsuits lynchings boycotts bombings preferential treatment superiority complexes inferiority complexes and inhumane acts based solely on skin tone and misconceptions millennials like myself are often steeped just as deep in the troubles of race as generations before us this isnt to say that advancements havent been made civil rights career options for minorities and intercultural dynamics have no doubt improved in america since my parents day but progress in regard to race is not linear it never has been and never will be every generation has different ways of dealing with the rainbow colored elephant in the room influenced no doubt by previous eras but distinct in its own right

2413642 the bedrock of a strategy that can engage the worlds population in assuming responsibility for its collective destiny must be the consciousness of the oneness of humankind deceptively simple in popular discourse the concept that humanity constitutes a single people presents fundamental challenges to the way that most of the institutions of contemporary society carry out their functions whether in the form of the adversarial structure of civil government the advocacy principle informing most of civil law a glorification of the struggle between classes and other social groups or the competitive spirit dominating so much of modern life conflict is accepted as the mainspring of human interaction it represents yet another expression in social organization of the materialistic interpretation of life that has progressively consolidated itself over the past two centuries in a letter addressed to queen victoria over a century ago and employing an analogy that points to the one model holding convincing promise for the organization of a planetary society bah ull h compared the world to the human body there is indeed no other model in phenomenal existence to which we can reasonably look human society is composed not of a mass of merely differentiated cells but of associations of individuals each one of whom is endowed with intelligence and will nevertheless the modes of operation that characterize mans biological nature illustrate fundamental principles of existence chief among these is that of unity in diversity paradoxically it is precisely the wholeness and complexity of the order constituting the human body and the perfect integration into it of the bodys cells that permit the full realization of the distinctive capacities inherent in each of these component elements no cell lives apart from the body whether in contributing to its functioning or in deriving its share from the well being of the whole the physical well being thus achieved finds its purpose in making possible the expression of human consciousness that is to say the purpose of biological development transcends the mere existence of the body and its parts what is true of the life of the individual has its parallels in human society the human species is an organic whole the leading edge of the evolutionary process that human consciousness necessarily operates through an infinite diversity of individual minds and motivations detracts in no way from its essential unity indeed it is precisely an inhering diversity that distinguishes unity from homogeneity or uniformity what the peoples of the world are today experiencing bah ull h said is their collective coming of age and it is through this emerging maturity of the race that the principle of unity in diversity will find full expression from its earliest beginnings in the consolidation of family life the process of social organization has successively moved from the simple structures of clan and tribe through multitudinous forms of urban society to the eventual emergence of the nation state each stage opening up a wealth of new opportunities for the exercise of human capacity

2413644 children are the most precious treasure a community can possess for in them are the promise and guarantee of the future they bear the seeds of the character of future society which is largely shaped by what the adults constituting the community do or fail to do with respect to children they are a trust no community can neglect with impunity

2413646 in the contingent world there are many collective centers which are conducive to association and unity between the children of men
2413647 a word of warning should however be uttered in this connection

2413650 let the white make a supreme effort in their resolve to contribute their share to the solution of this problem to abandon once for all their usually inherent and at times subconscious sense of superiority to correct their tendency towards revealing a patronizing attitude towards the members of the other race to persuade them through their intimate spontaneous and informal association with them of the genuineness of their friendship and the sincerity of their intentions and to master their impatience of any lack of responsiveness on the part of a people who have received for so long a period such grievous and slow healing wounds

2413654 to discriminate against any race on the ground of its being socially backward politically immature and numerically in a minority is a flagrant violation of the spirit that animates the faith of bah ull h shoghi effendi advent of divine justice p 35 i recently watched a program conducted by bill moyers a journalist for pbs during which he interviewed a gentleman named douglas blackmon about his new book slavery by another name this book concerned the world of post emancipation slavery in the south and more generally the american attitude towards freed slaves the book discusses the evolution of forced labour by companies in texas alabama and georgia and illustrated accounts of labour camps in which african americans were held under the pretense of imprisonment the majority of these cases overwhelmingly affirm that the practice of falsely accusing blacks of perpetrating crimes in the south was a ruse to create a new brand of slavery one that was technically legal in the post civil war and reconstruction periods of the united states it was during this time that former slave owners in compliance with new anti slavery laws that slavery took another name and the southern economy and even the american economy continued its addiction to forced labour

2413665 there appears to be scriptural support for both a race affirming and race transcending perspective in bahai thought it may be that god loves color but it is also true that the soul has no race

2413667 in this painting the story is told of how humanity was divided by the creator into different colored peoples who were given custodianship over differing types of knowledge for a time they would be separate peoples while they learned how to be custodians of each form of knowledge later there would come a time when the different races would be called together again by the creator to exchange and share that knowledge with each other which includes knowledge of how to carry it appropriately and honor its origins and become one diverse family again and renew their relationship with each other the earth and the spirit world according to the teller of the story lakota elders believe there are signs that the time for reconciliation and sharing have been upon us for some time now the story continued that if we chose to ignore the signs reminding us to come together again to share the creator would take the earth into his hands and shake it up to three times to make us remember the call to share together again humanity would still have a choice upon each shaking of the earth until the third and largest shaking accompanied by great suffering which would force us to realize our interdependence as family again in this story spoken of above denying the spiritual connections is the cause of the extremes of wealth and poverty the world wars and the degradation of the environment such dire circumstances will only stop escalating when we either make a conscious choice as peoples to respond to the above call to share or when there is so much suffering we are forced to reconcile and share again with spirit as family
2413668 the ability to share knowledge requires systems that acknowledge and empower the right of indigenous self determination to define and control that knowledge otherwise knowledge cannot be shared merely taken freedom and self determination are fundamental to both the capacity to love and to share both of the words love and sharing lose their meaning unless they are freely chosen

2413670 consider the flowers of a garden though differing in kind color form and shape yet inasmuch as they are refreshed by the waters of one spring revived by the breath of one wind invigorated by the rays of one sun this diversity increaseth their charm and addeth unto their beauty how unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and plants the leaves and blossoms the fruit the branches and the trees of that garden were all of the same shape and color diversity of hues form and shape enricheth and adorneth the garden and heighteneth the effect thereof in like manner when divers shades of thought temperament and character are brought together under the power and influence of one central agency the beauty and glory of human perfection will be revealed and made manifest naught but the celestial potency of the word of god which ruleth and transcendeth the realities of all things is capable of harmonizing the divergent thoughts sentiments ideas and convictions of the children of men
2413671 colors are phenomenal but the realities of men are essence when there exists unity of the essence what power has the phenomenal when the light of reality is shining what power has the darkness of the unreal if it be possible gather together these two races black and white into one assembly and put such love into their hearts that they shall not only unite but even intermarry be sure that the result of this will abolish differences and disputes between black and white moreover by the will of god may it be so this is a great service to humanity

2413979 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2413980 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2413981 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2413982 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2413983 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2414005 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
2414006 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2414007 so they had a hearing late at night robin was put into jail and since that point he has been held here in colarado springs in the criminal justice center in el paso county basically just a regular old county jail with all kinds of people dangerous criminals many of them and its a difficult place to be but robins in good spirits and were now dealing with the consequences of his action in the military courts here

2414009 if i tell the iraqi police or the sons of iraq they will tell the wrong people and i will be killed i dont trust them if i tell the americans theyll tell no one how they found about the grenades
2414010 when the sois sons of iraq stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2414011 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire costs of that program
2414012 the u s military was supposed to be out of the employment business by now when it introduced the sons of iraq initiative last year senior commanders expected the local security personnel to be hired gradually into the ranks of the iraqi army and police but iraqs shiite dominated central government has balked at the idea of bringing so many young sunni men including many onetime militants into the countrys fledging security forces less than 20 of the roughly 103 000 sons of iraq had been given government jobs as of early june that has left u s forces responsible for employing and paying the iraqis
2414013 the national front and other onetime insurgent groups will join a bitter struggle for power between established sunni politicians of the iraqi islamic party and upstart leaders of the sahwa or awakening council a u s backed tribal alliance whose popularity has grown following its success in combating the group al qaeda in iraq entering the elections is to change the current reality in our area the domination of the sunni spectrum by the iraqi islamic party said effan al issawi the top awakening commander in falluja they are unworthy of leading the sunnis
2414014 i believe i have something okay we continue to urge the council of representatives to seek a compromise that can be adopted promptly we regret that the iraqi parliament adjourned yesterday without finishing its work on a local elections law the parliamentarians have made great strides towards finishing the closing agreement on most of the more difficult issues we recognize that the election law brought to the floor important questions regarding the status of kirkuk the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the eleciton law the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2414015 my understanding is that theyre continuing i dont have anything particular to say about the process right now we havent discussed those publicly before im not going to here as we said well provide you with details when we get through with this
2414016 i would not be prepared to provide a timeline for that
2414017 shiite militia leader muqtada al sadr stepped back into iraqs political fray friday with an offer that if genuine washington would be hard pressed to refuse set a timetable for withdrawal of u s troops from iraq and the mahdi army will begin to disband the main reason for the armed resistance is the american miltiary presence said sadr emissary salah al ubaidi who spoke to reporters in najaf friday if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2414018 was one of the main reasons that violence in iraq has dropped to the lowest levels in four years for both civilians and trooops
2414019 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2414020 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too

2414148 any time their spider needs to view a swf file it will load up this version of the flash player and at any given point in the application it will give the text and links that are available then what google and yahoo are doing then is driving that application with a virtual user and they can navigate the application whether its an application website or what have you and keep going down different paths of the file until they feel that they have viewed all the content
2414149 as they get it theyll take all the data that they want and can do actually what they want with it and attribute the value of that data back to the html page so that when an end user actually does the search they will be provided with links that have content thats relevant
2414150 what they are going to be given is an application that is going to provide them with some additional options and some of this are the hooks that we have given the search partners to work with that it knows what display objects are currently being displayed they can try different events with them and actually kind of interrogate the swf in many ways they can simulate pretty much any user interaction as well
2414151 one thing this player does is it takes in flashvars that are being passed into the page so if you have pages that have different flashvars to get you into different states of the application that would actually be respected and it would be indexed accordingly
2414152 we do expect the seo community to lock onto this and start providing best practices about what you do inside your swf and how it will actually translate into higher or lower search rankings

2414160 shelley has spent her whole adult life living in the mansion but when she gets booted out shes completely adrift we took that idea and spent a few months ruminating over where she would land and we finally came up with the idea that she should enter the world of a sorority a misfit sorority that desperately needs her help
2414161 shelley has this idea that if she changes the zetas into super hot girls then they will be able to get guys and if they can get guys they can get pledges and keep their house
2414162 she teaches the girls how to be cool and cute and popular thats definitely true but for shelley its all about self confidence
2414163 shelley defined herself as a bunny and thought that was all she was capable of she only defined herself in terms of her value as an object for male eyes but then she learns she has more inherent talents and a bigger purpose in life than just being a bunny
2414164 its not just a message for girls but everyone learning to accept themselves and love themselves for who they are
2414165 when we first meet shelley she may think shes the hottest girl but she learns to realize that how you look is not important its about how you look at yourself

2414172 as regards prices in france and the uk the reason that french electricity bills are lower is nuclear power

2414357 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2414358 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2414359 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2414360 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2414361 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2414362 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2414363 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2414364 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2414365 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2414366 i realized the pros dont hit it any farther than i do
2414367 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2414368 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par

2414373 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2414374 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2414375 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2414376 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2414377 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2414378 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2414379 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work

2414381 88 doch nazi 7331 f r dem gr faz seine initialen aber wahrscheinlich sind die alle in china die olympiade er ffnen so aus sentimentalit t quasi
2414382 this is very common occurrence especially in an area where were a military town where ordinance was readily available during the 40s and 50s and may have been buried or cast aside or in a shed somewhere
2414383 it was a mess you could see blood on the wall
2414384 when we read crime scene and this young mans name you know this cant be what it says it is
2414385 it was a creepy feeling to see this dead body and know it was the real thing
2414386 brandon devore crime scene 11 12 1998 11 13 1998
2414387 the date is friday november 13 the time approximately 12 51 a m
2414388 the right hand had what appeared to be blood and tissue debris underneath nails as well as some hair in that hand
2414389 it is kind of troubling to think that evidence from a homicide would just end up on the streets
2414390 it just seemed like it was put there for somebody to find the way it was laying there
2414391 the occurrence of events that happen at the same time by accident but seem to have some connection
2414392 the main street office provides a place to start discovering the downtown and a bit of our heritage
2414393 she said when i do it with everyone im exhausted and it hurts but when i do it myself its easy
2414394 youre focusing on the music rather than your breathing or what youre doing
2414395 if youre just making sure you get 45 or 60 minutes of aerobic exercise in to burn calories you want to distract yourself youre not even thinking about exercise and all of a sudden youre done
2414396 its exciting to have something like this because it was definitely a year to remember
2414397 its nice to have something other than a trophy for once to look back on
2414398 it was nice after coming to two of these camps to have a ceremony in front of all the guys who are trying to do what we just did
2414399 its nice not to have to play in this one
2414400 it hurts our northern guys because we have 20 guys trying out and we dont have a junior b league in the north for them to go and play in
2414401 if you look at the players it looks like it may come down to picking one 17 year old goalie and four players
2414402 i believe in taking the best players that come to camp and putting them on a team and competing in a league where every team had that same opportunity before
2414403 this rule goes right in the face of that original goal
2414404 kids who were still going to school could stay close to home and be able to travel back and forth and see their parents more often a kid from yukon 24 hours away from here in whitehorse now hes got to be another eight hours away
2414405 it has come to our attention that some of you may not be aware of a new policy approved for this season as this may affect your camp preparation and will no doubt affect your team selection we wanted to make sure that you had this information as soon as possible
2414406 the last few years the team thats been the oldest has won
2414407 last year the cougars 80 per cent of their team was 17 year olds i guess because grant and them won weve got to change the rule
2414408 a difference of opinion over coaching styles or motivational techniques
2414409 we have to know whether dempsey has actually broken any rules or not
2414410 some of the things i would think on a moral standpoint hes definitely crossed the line whether hes crossed the line on any legal issues or not we have to know what those laws are within the league
2414411 there is no specific threat that triggered the movement of the joint terrorism center here
2414412 but a recognition and a realization that we all are more effective when we co locate and are able to exchange information across the hallway as opposed to on the telephone
2414413 as soon as we started running classes in the building we started getting people from seventeen different towns in lamoille county and beyond
2414414 they range from 2 000 to 7 000 or 8 000 the payback is short if prices continue to go up
2414415 smoke stack height so that smoke is getting into the upper atmosphere rather than staying low this is a 12 month heating system there will be burning in the summer
2414416 where they have access to wood a poorly insulated farm house a majority of the homes you will see outside the village low stack on units and burning green wood and dont extend them tend to burn green wood and cause problems for the neighbors
2414417 we became the top attraction in montreal 26 years ago the day we opened and weve never given up the title the only jet boat ride in the downtown of a major metropolitan city anywhere in the world
2414418 you get as wet as if you just jumped off the dock and into the water there
2414419 and you get the most beautiful view of down montreal
2414420 theres one that really got us it was like being at the bottom of a swimming pool sooo much water
2414421 and its also natures roller coaster its the wettest ride you could ever imagine
2414422 it was so fun i was really scared but it was worth it in the end
2414423 i have so much water in my shoes right now
2414424 it doesnt matter how old you are youre going to have a great laugh
2414425 one of my concerns is that sex offenders are crafty and clever and i hope they will implement a law that will prevent this from happening to another child
2414426 it truly is a tragedy and i welcome the opportunity again to make it better
2414427 i myself was asked do i recommend discharge what i said was he had been successful in complying with the terms and conditions of his probation and i saw no reason for him to be withheld from probation
2414428 he was where he said he was but for having the registration expired he wasnt avoiding supervision he was where he needed to be
2414429 when i read the whole damn record i see truly the failure of our corrections system to talk to each other
2414430 with the benefit of hindsight we were wrong the department was wrong and the prosecutor was right
2414431 i think we are going to see changes i think its going to be more difficult to be a sex offender in vermont
2414432 we are satisfied that were we to take this case to trial we would be able to convict bruce ivins of responsibility for this attack
2414433 this is a major major crime it went across numerous jurisdictions involved all kinds of federal and state laws the person who did it knew they faced a potential death penalty
2414434 der krisenstab ist unvermindert intensiv darum bem ht die beiden verschleppten wieder in sichere deutsche obhut zu bringen
2414435 this study illustrates the extraordinary power of genetics to reveal insights into some of the key events in our species history
2414436 tiny bands of early humans forced apart by harsh environmental conditions coming back from the brink to reunite and populate the world truly an epic drama written in our dna
2414437 who would have thought that as recently as 70 000 years ago extremes of climate had reduced our population to such small numbers that we were on the very edge of extinction
2414438 that software coupled with a keystroke capture program would allow an attacker to grab the credentials needed to log into the fbis national crime information center database
2414439 this was a company that had maintained they were sarbanes oxley compliant for several years yet i had control of the business within the first 20 minutes i could actively change general ledgers and do other critical tasks
2414440 ive had people who have spent millions of dollars on security to say they are compliant and i walk in and pop open their main credit card processing system within 10 minutes
2414441 the government has narrowed the scope of compliance so much to make it cost affordable that it overlooks a lot of things that are real life security vs paper security
2414442 you should always make sure youre up to date on patches and turn off ports and services youre not using
2414443 i like to show people through the use of software like core impact how easily i can get through their whole network i even let them drive the tool so they can see how someone with zero knowledge can attack them thats usually when they realize security is something they have to do
2414444 thats worse than if i told him i could steal 100 million worth of cars because thats his reputation
2414445 with the automated tools you could tell if someone ran a scanner against your firewall but web servers pose a bigger challenge
2414446 often developers are more concerned about functionality than the people who would abuse that functionality
2414447 well over 50 of the web applications in production that we test can perform cross account actions such as logging in as user a and looking at data reserved for user b or executing functions that only user b is authorized to do this is just bad access control enforcement
2414448 in government theres a big push for e government and thats great because we should be giving citizens access to resources but theres not enough testing of these new web applications before they are deployed and yet they have a huge door called port 80 thats not secure
2414449 really special and sorry to tell you probably more expensive
2414450 and the stunning thing is that nobody was surprised many had assumed infinite free storage was already the case
2414451 the vast majority of product will not move starting jan 1 2009
2414452 all im getting is we cant do it we cant do it its too expensive
2414453 and i ask what value do you folks put on a life
2414454 it was so easy to get the loans and the credit that you almost think the goods are a gift from the shop
2414455 you dont fully realize that its real money you are spending until you actually sit down and consolidate your bills and then its a shock
2414456 culturally maybe also because of the defeat in the war germans remain reluctant to borrow and banks are often state owned pushing less for profits from lending
2414457 its easier to get a loan or a credit card these days than to get a savings product
2414458 the housing boom automatically made people feel richer than they actually were and people went on to use the equity locked up in their property almost as a bank account they can dip into every time they want to buy a new car
2414459 you tend to use credit to pay for credit and as far as the banks are concerned you are fine
2414460 rather than showing up at court you just fill in an online form and speak to someone on the phone
2414461 false sense of security that is now coming to haunt us
2414462 its all good as long as the economy is doing well but if that changes people will really get caught short
2414463 we characterized the upper end of the band as more likely to be driven by geopolitical turmoil and that recession was a key risk to our view
2414464 in fact oil prices have reached 100 a barrel without extraordinary turmoil and the u s currently appears to be in recession
2414465 as the lack of supply growth and price insulated non oecd demand suggest a future rebound in u s gross domestic product growth or a major oil supply disruption could lead to 150 200 a barrel oil prices
2414466 the core of our super spike view is that oil prices will keep rising until demand declines globally on a multiyear basis resulting in the return of excess capacity and a lower cost structure
2414467 given this view once excess capacity returns we think prices can move sharply lower
2414468 the danger is if peoples confidence is lost in a place like bear stearns no one will lend to anybody
2414469 its easier for community businesses to hire new employees than keep ones who have been working
2414470 then of course these people dont have any qualifications for other employment
2414471 and with the cost of clothing going up it makes it more difficult
2414472 but managers at all three stores kohls wal mart and jc penney co in new philadelphia are putting on great sales
2414473 as in years past the dress a child volunteers at each location will make the final determination regarding the appropriateness of clothing prior to approval for purchase
2414474 we didnt have 20 000 to hire an attorney so we just lost it
2414475 it doesnt have to be that close of a signature for forgery they spelled my name wrong it means nothing
2414476 if youre going to a bank and cash a check they want a thumbprint but you can send a dog with a note to the register of deeds if youve got the money they dont even look at you they dont know who you are
2414477 you see blue crush people out roaming the streets trying to get people off the streets for old traffic fines and drug deals but theres people stealing houses and they say oh thats not important
2414478 i will not go away till we change this law
2414479 the kids walked into this big arena and stepped up to the challenge they were ready to go we prepared them and i think they really put on the best show of the year it was quite exhilarating to watch them
2414480 theyve made the corrections weve asked for and theyre as ready as we could ever get anybody to go i think theyre just going to relax have fun and put on an even better show tomorrow
2414481 the two corps mingle there are lots of friends and lots of interconnections it is a battle ill use that word it is a battle all the way through and it does get intense sometimes but overall theres this level of professionalism along with a level of friendly rivalry
2414482 it was actually really good i had some fumbles but i made good recoveries and the energy out there was just amazing
2414483 my nanas been taking me to shows ever since i was one my first parade was with her when i was four years old with the light brigade senior corps a little less than a month ago she died in a car accident so this show today was for her
2414484 right before we go on the tenors always clasp hands give a nice firm handshake before every show and every time whether its the first show or the last show we play together we give it our all thats the moment for me thats really going to make it all worthwhile
2414485 it can be hot tiring and sometimes frustrating but i love it
2414486 this is why i paid my tour dues and this is why i get up every morning to eat that food to wear these drums all day in the heat and humidity shoot i even had a knee brace on a couple of times after an injury and im still doing what im doing i love it and i dont want to stop
2414487 there was a baritone and contra feature in the ballad and everything about it was just perfect they had absolutely perfect intonation i had chills and tears and it started then they had an unbelievable show and everyone was in the right spot ill quote our director jeff dozier weve got our foot in the door of dci and were kicking it down were going places no one ever expected us to go
2414488 that show was basically the greatest birthday present i could have ever had
2414489 he recently had scoliosis repair in february he planned it so that he could be here to march this summer he was home for about six weeks went back to school at the end of april and went to the first rehearsal camp with impulse in the middle of may and the doctor gave him the go ahead hes been going ever since hes been doing awesome and he just plugs right along nothing will stop him this is his life
2414490 so you think our buses going over niagara falls would be funny
2414491 so you think it would be funny to see a bunch of helmets and bodies floating downriver

2414514 i while ago i met with matt schwartz from the new york times magazine under the explicit condition that i would be covering philosophy and history and not my personal business i feel i didnt really get what i want out of this exchange as the important philosophy i conveyed to him was only conveyed in short bits that i think were taken out of context

2414525 why suffer what humans have suffered the pain and the despair what meaning can all of this have for kierkegaard there is no meaning unless passion the emotions and will of humans has a divine source passion is closely aligned with faith in kierkegaards thought faith as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world even though everything we can know intellectually speaks against it to live and die for a belief to stake everything one has and is in the belief in something that has a higher meaning than anything else in the world this is belief and passion at their highest
2414526 i realized the pros dont hit it any farther than i do
2414527 when i hit my driver like i did friday this is an easy sport
2414528 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2414529 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2414530 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leader board and feeling the good vibes
2414531 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2414532 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2414533 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2414534 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2414535 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2414536 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2414537 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2414538 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome

2414541 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2414542 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2414543 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2414544 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2414545 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2414546 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

2414556 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
2414557 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day

2414560 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

2414570 it being a hit and run that was the worst of all
2414571 he cared for a lot of people in this community
2414572 its a tragic loss the fact it was a hit and run makes it even more tragic

2414583 in the services sector no arab country was in the 30 nation list of exporters but the uae entered the list of importers last year ranking 29th in the list its services imports were estimated at us 27 billion accounting for 0 9 per cent of the total global imports of services
2414584 given the uae government policy commitments to the highest standards of non proliferation and in support for global non proliferation goals the government of the united arab emirates would like to express its political and financial support for the proposed iaea administered international low enriched uranium fuel bank
2414585 i welcome the uaes contribution to the establishment of a nuclear fuel reserve under iaea auspices
2414586 the uae donation marks another important milestone towards supporting mechanisms for non discriminatory non political assurances of supply of fuel for nuclear power plants
2414587 policy of the uae on the evaluation and potential development of peaceful nuclear energy
2414588 the uae financial contribution to the proposed fuel bank should provide incentives for other states to follow the uae model to forgo enrichment and rely exclusively on the international market in nuclear fuels backed up by supplier commitments and an iaea fuel bank to meet their needs for nuclear fuel for power reactors in this context the uae encourages other states to support the iaeas initiatives in establishing multi lateral fuel assurance programmes
2414589 the palm monorail is not only the first system of its kind to be completed in the middle east but is also setting global standards for the transportation industry we have employed state of the art technology to overcome a number of challenges whether that is running 1 000m of rail over sea meeting dubais unique climatic conditions or protecting the communities of palm jumeirah by utilising a virtually silent track system
2414590 the double track system has been completed on schedule and we will soon receive the monorail vehicles from japan when we will begin a meticulous six month testing period in preparation for this process a number of our staff travelled to osaka to be trained taking advantage of the close relationship between the governments of the twinned cities of dubai and osaka with the full corporation of our strategic partner rta we expect to have the monorail operational and capable of carrying more than 40 000 passengers on palm jumeirah each day by april 2009
2414591 the rta is working closely with the office of british rail for the palm monorails inspection and eventually certification process once the palm monorail system is connected with the dubai metro tourists will be able to leave dubai airport on the metro and continue through to palm jumeirah where they change over to the monorail system and move onwards to their hotel

2414658 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2414659 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2414660 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2414661 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2414662 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2414663 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2414664 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2414665 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2414666 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2414673 this rare night in beijing will become an important page in the history of world civilisation
2414674 the beijing olympic games is a new starting point for human civilisation to move toward the future now the expectation is for a more open china to make greater contributions to humanity
2414675 the pride of beijing is that we have fulfilled the commitments made to the international community for a successful beijing games we are also proud of beijing because beijing has not let down the expectations of 1 3 billion chinese
2414676 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2414677 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2414678 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2414679 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2414680 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2414681 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2414682 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2414683 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2414684 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2414685 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2414686 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2414687 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2414688 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2414689 yes but what about this if the is test is negative then why

2414702 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2414703 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2414704 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2414705 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2414706 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

2414737 all it would take is a careless employee to accidentally expose everyones number the 16 digits on the chip that associate a person with his or her information to an ill intentioned hacker
2414738 a series of veterinary and toxicology studies dating to the mid 1990s stated that chip implants had induced malignant tumors in some lab mice and rats
2414739 leading cancer specialists reviewed the research for the associated press and while cautioning that animal test results do not necessarily apply to humans said the findings troubled them some said they would not allow family members to receive implants and all urged further research before the glass encased transponders are widely implanted in people
2414740 the verichip company was not aware of any studies that have resulted in malignant tumors in mice or rats and certainly not cats or dogs
2414741 omitted from the sheaf of studies included in the fda application for approval
2414742 verichips media efforts have done little to salvage the companys public image or its financial performance both of which plummeted after research linking the implantable microchip to cancer was first widely revealed
2414743 the same company that once predicted revenues in the billions earned just 3 000 from its microchip implant operations in the first quarter of 2008
2414744 we dont want microchips implanted in us for any reason and we wont stop till the threat is gone

2414757 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2414758 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

2414766 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2414767 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2414768 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2414769 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2414770 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2414771 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2414772 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2414773 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2414774 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2414775 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2414776 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2414796 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2414797 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2414798 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2414799 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2414800 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2414801 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2414802 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2414803 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2414804 vimos que la huelga no nos iba a dar ninguna salida al conflicto por lo que acordamos dar un margen de confianza al concello

2414808 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2414809 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2414810 maybe the cubes were the wrong shape or they didnt taste that good im not sure
2414811 but it got to the point where people came for cocktails and they were bringing different bags of ice
2414812 b y o i was a turning point for me
2414813 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2414814 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2414815 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2414816 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2414817 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2414818 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
2414819 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
2414820 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
2414821 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
2414822 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
2414823 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
2414824 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
2414825 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
2414826 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
2414827 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war we got through world war i we got through world war ii we won the war on the great depression
2414828 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
2414829 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards

2414957 maybe you want to do a brett weston and you dont want anyone to open your files maybe you want your files to just die a peaceful death and you want to pull the plug on them and send them on to eternity and what you want are these finished prints they are the realization of your vision and everything else was just a way to get there like you dont actually want somebody in a sense reprinting from your negatives youre done its fine even though with photography the temptation is that its always an open door its fine to lock the door and throw away the key thats ok
2414958 if you go and photograph a beggar it makes a huge difference whether you stand in front of the beggar the same thing is true for children if you stand in front of them and point your camera down or whether you physically go down on your knees and try and see the world through their eyes from there perspective
2414959 so much of it is having faith in your work and your vision if you believe in yourself and you believe in what youre doing and you illustrate your vision then the money will come and everything will fall into place

2414962 the elements of storytelling that go into a 10 year project on salmon or a 6 week project on poverty in america are the same elements that go into the coverage of the wedding day
2414963 art is not what you see but what you make others see
2414964 some of the great pictures you just look at them and you marvel at them for the subject matter and somehow they struck a chord in you but its rarely about the technique its not about the lens or the film or the light necessarily its really just some story in that picture some emotional element which you connect with
2414965 people werent doing filters like this with color they were afraid to do anything with color
2414966 ive always loved films and ive always loved documentary films partly because i love music and i love sound and so in a way i saw film as a way of combining what i knew from still photography with this idea of sound light motion moment composition those are all the sort of hard skills that we possess as photographers makes it easier to move over into new media
2414967 im under no illusions that my photography is going to change the world but i believe we all contribute in our small ways to a bigger aggregate in helping to form the collective memory to helping form the history of our time and thats what really motivates me
2414968 taking a photograph is a gut feeling there is no correct way to process an image its correct in the sense that you know if you move the black point too high youre going to get all sorts of pixelization happening or whatever but so i burn something out maybe thats exciting technically yes its wrong the white point is way above 255 or whatever but who cares if its an exciting image its an exciting image
2414969 there is an inherent believability that photography has and weve been conditioned from a very youthful age to believe in images so there is a wonderful sort of psychological dissonance that occurs when youre seeing these images where all the detail is there but the mystery remains and thats what i personally find attractive
2414970 we started from a supposition of content being king and we wanted to move the interface out of the way of the content and that was a real rallying point when we all found a model for the ui where we could dedicate up to 95 of the screen to image content and have the ui politely get out of the way or be invoked as needed
2414971 its a little bit of a different approach in that lightroom tries very hard to have your workflow abstracted from where your image is landing
2414972 im looking to expand a photographic vision beyond the obvious into the edge of light into the edge of seeing in a way into the edge of my imagination because intuition and imagination are such a big part of photography
2414973 im a climber and you kind of have to be to photograph the rock climbing because you have to have the skills to get above the climber to get in position with them and to hang out with them on these big walls so that youre comfortable
2414974 its hard for me to imagine eating anything that ive seen on a postcard and they the puffins are very cute and so i prefer to just let them carry on in the wild without being anybodys dinner
2414975 its always light were always shooting its catnaps two or three hours here two or three hours there so its all merging together its a different kind of rhythm
2414976 the wide open spaces are mind boggling and incredibly freeing i like this space this space is just big
2414977 the opportunity to make pictures here that are about color and about light and about form is just never ending
2414978 i am very disappointed and numbed by it it is a very unsatisfactory situation made all the more so by the shadow it casts over the very good performance of some of our businesses
2414979 it is my determination to get us out of all this i wont do this job for ever but right now im extremely galvanised by the task in hand
2414980 the balance sheet was too large for the individual bank that we are and too large for current markets
2414981 if you go cold turkey on lending to the market your capital ratios rise but people have long memories we are open for business
2414982 if we could bank those growth rates now we would
2414983 we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort but it is important to remember that we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s
2414984 for years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked and ordinary families are now feeling the effects with rising mortgage repayments and sky high food and fuel costs it is little wonder that more and more peoples budgets have been driven to breaking point
2414985 these numbers remain extremely small when seen in the context of the 11 74m mortgages in the uk
2414986 the possession rate now is similar to that of the late 1990s but remains less than half the rate experienced in the early 1990s
2414987 with current fears that unemployment is set to grow there is no doubt we are inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis
2414988 but the real horror is that today struggling homeowners have less protection than in the 1990s but most people dont even realise it
2414989 research by shelter shows 23 of mortgage payers think they would receive prompt state help if they could not pay their mortgage in reality because financial help for homeowners in difficulty was cut after the last housing crash nothing would kick in for nine months which is too late

2415031 im really impressed by the planning that went into this sports betting project were going to be offering a wholesome curriculum that will prepare students to meet the demands of the real world while developing their appreciation for learning
2415032 were excited to announce ground breaking on our citys newest project a sports betting school for talented students to foster careers and livelihoods
2415033 once construction begins we estimate a two year completion time
2415034 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best sports betting learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
2415035 this project is vast but will be very beneficial to our youth
2415036 this initiative will save paper save time and make use of the information super highway
2415037 and since we wont have to update texts every couple of years the information we use from the net will always be up to date and relevent to each field offered at our sports betting school
2415038 which will be open to all students with a b or better overall average well be competing against all other district schools both public and private to expose our scholar athletes to the best competition in the area
2415039 it will be the best in the nation and will prepare all burgio kinneman county youth for the challenges of tomorrow
2415040 were going to finance this the easy way and tax payers will barely notice any changes in their bills

2415042 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace

2415044 the mood is very positive people are saying they want to keep the territory on track
2415045 but ask me in couple of hours after i have visited a few marginals as to how i am feeling
2415046 therell have to be a full moon and some bizarre turnaround for this to become a political contest
2415047 if they do badly at this election there may well be an outbreak of a central australian party and that would threaten the clp
2415048 my focus has been on delivering good honest leadership and making sure that weve presented a clear alternative to territorians
2415049 we would expect him to abide by it once hes properly served and he was we believe after the game last night
2415050 he didnt accept the documents that were tried to be handed to him so we may have to approach the court to confirm that theyre happy with it
2415051 otherwise if someone didnt want to be served youd never be able to serve them
2415052 the way they conducted themselves was consistent with him and the club having knowledge of the order
2415053 do you think we should drill for oil in anwr
2415054 for example the drilling will take place only in winter so that it will not disturb the caribou migration special ice roads will be used that melt after use so theres no impact on the tundra and three dimensional seismic and horizontal drilling technology will be used to achieve the smallest drilling footprint possible
2415055 hedge funds will find the environment difficult unless theyre very good at maintaining the returns
2415056 we should see a significant shrinkage in the number of funds out there
2415057 the opportunity for hedge funds has been as good if not better than any period im aware of
2415058 it has changed so dramatically that pricing has come to where we can buy assets
2415059 its a lot more satisfying to work hard and get good deals done
2415060 the biggest thing is fear and how you deal with it
2415061 theyre very well connected theyve played a number of games together and you can see it out on the ground
2415062 they seem to have an its almost like an esp sense amongst them
2415063 they know theres a player there in space and they run to the right positions therefore the decisions and the speed of the ball movement happens
2415064 if they do that youd have to think theyve changed the way to some degree how football is played with their speed of ball movement theyre very very good at it
2415065 the guys who played the game they will have learned a lesson
2415066 we got a real big lesson in how to play team football
2415067 team football is paramount and they do it at a level were not near
2415068 we need to extract some of that but we need to develop our own style and ability to create pressure and turnovers
2415069 we have a good player alonso and we have another good player coming in soon
2415070 we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can
2415071 i do not know when but clearly we have problems on the left harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebastien leto cannot get a work permit
2415072 ryan babel is away in the olympic games maybe he can come back and fill that role but i know we can improve in this area
2415073 who comes in it could be another left sided player rather than a central midfielder
2415074 maybe he can play in three different positions that is a positive thing i am talking about one player but i wont say the name
2415075 i will try to improve the team and the squad if i can
2415076 i am pleased because we have not lost again i will try to do my best to improve the squad
2415077 kathleen my precious daughter please forgive me for any and all the pain i have caused you in your life please forgive me i am begging you

2415122 by an overwhelming margin of 2 to 1 americans want to lift the moratorium preventing drilling on the outer continental shelf thus unlocking vast energy resources shut down for the past 27 years democrats have been adamantly opposed they say that we cannot drill our way out of the oil crisis of course not but it is equally obvious that we cannot solar or wind or biomass our way out does this mean that because any one measure cannot solve a problem it needs to be rejected the consensus in the country logically unassailable and politically unbeatable is to do everything possible to both increase supply and reduce demand because we have a problem thats been killing our economy and threatening our national security and no one measure is sufficient

2415155 understand that climate change is an impending global catastrophe and believe that hyderabad and andhra pradesh will be particularly susceptible and commit to contribute in earnest to mitigating climate change and helping the people and natural environment of hyderabad to adapt

2415157 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2415158 if u k is worried weve far greater reason to be worried
2415159 if the u k is worried we have far greater reason to be worried
2415160 the implications for india could be catastrophic even if the temperature were to rise by as much as two degrees celsius because our adaptive capacity is so low
2415161 unlike a developed country such as the u k which can mobilise adaptation strategies like building barriers against sea level rise india does not have the financial technological or institutional capacity to cope even with existing natural disasters let alone climate change which would trigger an increase in extreme weather events like droughts and floods
2415162 even though vast resources were made available for tsunami relief and rehabilitation not even one third of those who lost their homes have been rehabilitated and only a fraction of houses built for the victims have been occupied because they were either found to be architecturally inappropriate or sociologically incompatible
2415163 communities who depend on climate sensitive sectors such as dryland farming fisheries and forest resources will be worst affected
2415164 for instance parts of orissa and andhra pradesh could begin to see temperatures going up to 50 degrees and cities like bangalore will begin to experience temperatures of 40 degrees by the end of the century

2415168 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products

2415178 the office needs someone who has business and administrative capabilities
2415179 he sits on the fence and doesnt come forward with his own initiatives
2415180 he came in as an educator and didnt have the skills necessary to run the office as a business

2415191 if you are an international organisation dependent on international visitors and guests eliminating your carbon footprint is going to be impossible its about tidying up the edges and not being profligate rather than eliminating it its about doing our best
2415192 the things that will have effect are the price of oil and whether people can come at all
2415193 where a flight is essential people should offset it and be very careful to buy offsets that are genuinely beneficial
2415194 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2415195 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2415196 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2415197 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2415198 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2415199 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power

2415201 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
2415202 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2415203 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
2415204 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital
2415205 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
2415206 with alcohol we acknowledge the distinction between use and abuse and we focus our law enforcement on efforts to stop irresponsible use we do not arrest or jail responsible drinkers that should be our policy for marijuana as well
2415207 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
2415208 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
2415209 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
2415210 ballot access is one of the unknown evils of the american electoral process
2415211 there cant be change by electing a republican or a democrat
2415212 i dont think either of these guys are going to do much
2415213 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2415214 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2415215 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2415216 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2415217 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2415218 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2415219 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2415220 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2415221 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
2415222 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
2415223 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2415224 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2415225 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2415226 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2415227 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2415228 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2415229 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2415230 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2415231 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
2415232 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2415233 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2415234 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2415235 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2415236 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2415237 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2415238 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2415239 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2415240 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2415241 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2415242 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2415243 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2415244 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2415245 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2415246 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2415247 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2415248 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2415249 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2415250 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
2415251 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2415252 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2415253 in every life there is one particular event that is decisive for the entire person for his fate his convictions his passions
2415254 where had all that russian generosity gone it had been replaced by political consciousness
2415255 for not having seen it all nor remembered it all for not having divined all of it
2415256 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2415257 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2415258 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2415259 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2415260 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2415261 just so you all know we did set a record
2415262 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2415263 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2415264 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2415265 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
2415266 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
2415267 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
2415268 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
2415269 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2415270 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2415271 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2415272 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2415273 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2415274 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2415275 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2415276 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2415277 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2415278 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2415279 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2415280 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2415281 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2415282 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2415283 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2415284 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2415285 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2415286 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2415287 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2415288 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2415289 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2415290 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2415291 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2415292 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2415293 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2415294 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2415295 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2415296 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2415297 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2415298 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2415299 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2415300 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2415301 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2415302 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2415303 barangsiapa yang melazimkan mendambakan dirinya selalu beristighfar kepada allah maka allah mudahkan saat ia sulit allah gembirakan saat ia sedih dan allah beri rezki dari jalan yang tidak pernah ia duga
2415304 beristighfarlah kepada tuhanmu sesungguhnya dia adalah maha pengampun niscaya dia akan mengirimkan hujan kepadamu dengan lebat dan membanyakkan harta dan anak anakmu dan mengadakan untukmu kebun kebun dan mengadakan pula di dalamnya untukmu sungai sungai
2415305 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2415306 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2415307 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2415308 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2415309 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2415310 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2415311 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2415312 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2415313 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2415314 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2415315 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2415316 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2415317 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2415318 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2415319 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2415320 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2415321 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2415322 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2415323 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2415324 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2415325 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2415326 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2415327 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2415328 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2415329 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2415330 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2415331 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2415332 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2415333 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2415334 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2415335 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2415336 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2415337 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2415338 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2415339 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2415340 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2415341 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2415342 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2415343 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2415344 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2415345 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2415346 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2415347 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2415348 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2415349 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2415350 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2415351 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2415352 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2415353 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2415354 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2415355 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2415356 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2415357 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2415358 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2415359 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2415360 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2415361 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2415362 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2415363 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2415364 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2415365 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2415366 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2415367 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2415368 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2415369 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2415370 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2415371 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2415372 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2415373 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2415374 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2415375 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2415376 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2415377 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2415378 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2415379 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2415380 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2415381 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2415382 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2415383 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2415384 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2415385 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2415386 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2415387 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2415388 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2415389 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2415390 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2415391 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2415392 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2415393 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2415394 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2415395 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2415396 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2415397 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2415398 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2415399 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2415400 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2415401 being a famous designer is like being a famous electrician
2415402 if youre at an electricians conference everybody knows you and as soon as you step out of there nobody has the slightest idea who you are
2415403 i think a lot of the things graphic designers do can be unbelievably powerful and extremely effective but completely invisible we only realise and see this power when it fails catastrophically
2415404 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2415405 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2415406 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2415407 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2415408 an appearance at the convention by edwards would only highlight the unresolved story
2415409 national enquirer scoop or not there appears to be way too much smoke here for the major mainstream media to continue ignoring the story about the out of wedlock child that john edwards may have fathered
2415410 but the story resurfaced in late july after the enquirer staked out a beverly hills hotel and reported edwards had met with his alleged mistress
2415411 for the most part mainstream media outlets have not pursued the matter in part because edwards no longer is a presidential candidate nor does he hold a public office
2415412 but the story resurfaced in late july after the enquirer staked out a beverly hills hotel and reported edwards had met with his alleged mistress
2415413 mr edwards is it true you were at the beverly hilton visting rielle hunter and your child on the night of july
2415414 would do everything in his power to make sure john edwards did not endorse hillary clinton
2415415 in an interview for broadcast tonight on nightline edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2415416 oh my god the pristine la times has sullied its hallowed self with mention of gasp the possible pause look over each shoulder affair of the now private citizen never mind he could have been vp or atty genl john r edwards quick quick my smelling salts
2415417 if this alleged affair and love child involved mitt romney or karl rove one might assume that the nations daily papers would have been more anxious to cover the story this coverage or lack of it stinks of liberal bias no matter the excuses put forth here
2415418 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2415419 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2415420 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2415421 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2415422 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2415423 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2415424 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2415425 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2415426 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2415427 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2415428 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2415429 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2415430 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation

2415444 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2415445 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2415446 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2415447 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2415448 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2415449 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2415450 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world

2415460 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex

2415462 the two new cyber shot phones that we have announced today share certain characteristics both phones place ease of use and best in class picture quality at the heart of their designs

2415472 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
2415473 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
2415474 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
2415475 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
2415476 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
2415477 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
2415478 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
2415479 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush

2415484 this is what the lord says let my people go so that they may worship me
2415485 this is for all those who couldnt say anything silenced
2415486 were concerned about his well being of course but we respect our professors and we respect their right to free speech
2415487 he believes in the right of all people and they should be able to exercise those rights freely and without inhibition and he makes that i think quite well known in all that he does
2415488 i didnt really think it was going to be a big deal
2415489 but i think all of the rules are out the window right now with this incident
2415490 he is a very good leader and we just know the word of god
2415491 had to get on the move now im at a kind of amusement park enjoying the day

2415497 the lee myung bak group had better face up to the serious situation and behave with discretion
2415498 i was disappointed as south and north korea couldnt march together
2415499 i believe what is more important in south north korean ties is practical improvement in their relations the easiest way to achieve that is through sports
2415500 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2415501 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2415502 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns

2415506 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2415507 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2415508 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2415509 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product

2415526 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2415527 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam

2415533 they simply did what they believed was right and we did too
2415534 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2415535 another three died in overnight attacks altogether 15 peacekeepers have been killed
2415536 ive never really had any problems with my lungs nor my breathing so it came as a bit of a shock and a scary one at that when i discovered my breathing was becoming more difficult the build up to this episode was purely down to i quite often get sleepy probably as a combined effect of the ms and side effects of some of the pills i take however over a period of a few weeks my fatigue was becoming more severe and would last all day and short naps were doing nothing to alleviate it during this period i noticed that my breathing was becoming more difficult it just felt like more of an effort the best way i can describe it is like trying to breathe whilst permanently having a duvet over your head fortunately this episode didnt last long and once my fatigue eased a bit my breathing was perfectly normal again
2415537 the only breathing difficulties i ever get are when i get the its so tight that i cant expand my ribcage enough to breathe properly so keep trying unsuccessfully to take deep breaths i believe that i should be doing the opposite like people who suffer asthma and take shorter shallow breaths through my nose until it has passed
2415538 the blasts in bangalore and ahmedabad reek of a conspiracy to divert attention from the cash for vote allegations and also to bring back the muslim vote which the government has lost due to the nuclear deal
2415539 i hope that he still likes me if im too late

2415546 i lost my innocence to men i did not have any idea who they were and now all that the french government can give back is rubbish all the evidence against its soldiers
2415547 recently i heard that they want to arrest our people for whatever they accused them at least they did not rape children like their own soldiers
2415548 i was brought by interahamwes to the stadium as they beat me and white soldiers dressed in military uniform were there one pulled me by hand and took me into a tent as i resisted he slapped me hard he tore my skirt off force my legs wide and penetrated me
2415549 i felt as if a metal was penetrating me the pain was so much i screamed so hard but nobody was helping me i was bleeding i felt it would be better if i died he finished raping me and moved out
2415550 we believed we were safe after the war was ending and we had seen whites bazungu claiming to have come to protect us we knew everything was ok
2415551 i was wrong my suffering was just going to start
2415552 in the stadium kamarampaka the interahamwe took me there directly and there were many white soldiers all over i was put in a room of the tent just near by and the next thing a huge white soldier entered and closed the tent closure and undressed
2415553 i was very small he just lifted me like a baby ripped off my cloths and he started raping me
2415554 the pain was terrible i screamed till i lost my breath i was bleeding profusely then he changed and penetrated me through my mouth
2415555 justice unfettered justice will one day be done power should not come with impunity

2415592 but ask me in couple of hours after i have visited a few marginals as to how i am feeling
2415593 therell have to be a full moon and some bizarre turnaround for this to become a political contest
2415594 if they do badly at this election there may well be an outbreak of a central australian party and that would threaten the clp

2415601 the proposition that the earth is not the centre of the world and immovable but that it moves is equally absurd and false philosophically and theologically considered at least erroneous in faith
2415602 just as heliocentricity was reasoned against because it contradicted christian view
2415603 lol that would be me that signed my name as cole whoops youd be surprised how many times i catch myself doing that
2415604 we just need to clean up ourselves and let god manifest through us

2415612 1 you cannot help the poor by destroying the rich
2415613 despite the fact that a recent poll found that americans now believe by a 3 1 ratio gas prices are a bigger problem than global warming the washington post noted that house speaker nancy pelosi d calif an avid opponent of offshore drilling vows to block a drilling vote and even dialogue from occurring on the house floor and senate majority leader harry reid d nev echoed the same sentiment when he eliminated energy amendments to his anti speculation bill at the same time senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd d w va canceled committee consideration of spending bills for fear that republicans would include drilling amendments
2415614 your original post was not written to encourage an intelligent discussion about the global poverty act but an attempt to obama bash
2415615 for he is gods minister to you for good but if you do evil be afraid for he does not bear the sword in vain for he is gods minister an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil
2415616 would matthew 25 verses 33 to 46 be of relevance
2415617 of course you will get tons of dribble from people who have not studied it and it will be reactionary because of the way you worded your question

2415619 in the history of humanity technology has often resulted in the manufacturing of sophisticated weapons and in war i wanted to invent a weapon of peace and to recall that the small step of a robot is a giant step for a more peaceful and equitable world the key is in the discovery of nature the robot is only the interface between man and nature if we understand better what a robot is we understand man better
2415620 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is proven he is a shield to all who trust in him
2415621 for who is god except the lord and who is the rock except god
2415622 he that lives and was dead but is alive forever more
2415623 he was in the world and world was made through him and the world did not know him and he came to his own and his own did not receive him
2415624 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
2415625 for in him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily
2415626 there is only one god but in the unity of the godhead there are three eternal and co equal persons the same in substance but distinct in subsistence

2415642 nana youre right there is no excuse for sin when we sin i say its willfully sinning
2415643 it is impossible to be save and continually disobey god
2415644 if thou be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine hand thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and they righteousness may profit the son of man

2415663 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2415664 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2415665 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2415666 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2415667 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2415668 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2415669 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2415670 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2415671 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2415672 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2415673 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2415674 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2415675 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2415676 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2415677 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2415678 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2415679 i saw crushing wounds but there were very few walking wounded
2415680 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2415681 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2415682 i was there from a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
2415683 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2415684 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2415685 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2415686 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2415687 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2415688 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2415689 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2415690 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2415691 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2415692 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2415693 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified at the convention
2415694 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2415695 i think furious would be a good way to describe it

2415723 we would expect him to abide by it once hes properly served and he was we believe after the game last night
2415724 he didnt accept the documents that were tried to be handed to him so we may have to approach the court to confirm that theyre happy with it
2415725 otherwise if someone didnt want to be served youd never be able to serve them
2415726 the way they conducted themselves was consistent with him and the club having knowledge of the order

2415870 it the letter says that the minister can now reach beijing only after aug 10 and he has to make his own arrangements for stay and travel to various locations where the event will take place so a final decision on whether he would go or not will be taken in the coming days
2415871 the presence of the minister will certainly boost the confidence of the athletes moreover with kerala aiming for lot of infrastructure developments in sports and games attending the olympics will give a lot of insights
2415872 no reason has been given for denying me permission and the central governments stand was not right
2415873 ik heb me er al bij neergelegd dat ik nooit van mijn leven meer iets zal doen waarvan ik de beste in de wereld ga worden daarom kan ik n nog n keer alles opzij zetten omdat ik weet dat ik nooit meer op zoek hoef te gaan naar die kick die vind ik namelijk toch niet
2415874 ik hoor atleten wel eens roepen dat ze op de spelen hun beste race willen zwemmen en dan wel zien wat het wordt als je dat soort teksten uit ben je al bezig met verliezen dan neem je genoegen met minder dan goud
2415875 waar gaat het me om het gaat me om die race niet om het olympische kledingpakket de aandacht van de media of de openingsof sluitingsceremonie het gaat me niet eens om die medaille of die huldiging zo ver durf ik al te gaan het enige waar ik een kick van krijg is die finale de wedstrijd zelf het m ten die ene kans daarvoor ben ik in de weer ik wil mezelf en de rest van de wereld laten zien dat ik de beste ben nog n keertje
2415876 dunia barangkali takkan menyaksikan lagi sebuah upacara dengan gema dan kreativitas seperti pembukaan olimpiade beijing
2415877 olimpiade paling ambisius dalam sejarah yang dibuka dengan pertunjukan paling spektakuler

2415879 something really bizarre is happening in the skies over the uk i ve been dealing in sightings for 30 years and we currently have something very real which mankind cannot explain
2415880 smith realized he could turn the air over inside the building an infinite number of times without making employees feel any cooler what was needed was a flow of air that could stimulate the natural cooling effect of an outdoor breeze
2415881 the cost amounted to less than the companys estimate for air conditioning an area comprising less than 20 of the total manufacturing area it was slightly more than twice the cost of the production time lost by the additional 10 minute breaks not only were the fans less expensive than air conditioning the operating cost of each is less than 50 cents per day
2415882 microsoft sql server 2008 is the only major database to include comprehensive tightly integrated functionality for data management as well as advanced business intelligence out of the box
2415883 between the shoulder and the neck i havent done a whole lot of serving
2415884 i had a decent rhythm on it tonight and i think more importantly i cut down on the double faults from last night
2415885 the second set was probably the first good set ive played in four months or so
2415886 i felt like i clicked in and the ball started doing what i wanted
2415887 i felt like i was winning the cross court backhand rallies which really put the onus on him
2415888 he couldnt win those rallies which really put the onus on him to do something he couldnt win those rallies so that meant he had to come up with something different which maybe put him out of his comfort zone a little bit
2415889 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2415890 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans
2415891 we didnt want to do this construction and tear up the new streets
2415892 were going to make sure for the future we dont have a collision like this again
2415893 centerpoint and downtown merchants both have jobs to do and they should find neutral ground and both work together

2415895 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2415896 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2415897 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2415898 ik ben dan ook zeer vereerd en verheugd dat ik aan deze ontwikkelingen een bijdrage kan leveren
2415899 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2415900 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2415901 ik dacht wel aan een medaille maar niet direct aan goud
2415902 het voelde niet speciaal ik ben gewoon heel blij en denk dat ik goed werk heb afgeleverd
2415903 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2415904 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2415905 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2415906 ik wil dit keer met een andere smaak in mijn mond de spelen afsluiten de schande van toen moet worden uitgewist
2415907 ik was thuis maar heb geen wedstrijd gezien ik stopte met kijken na de laatste oefenwedstrijd tegen itali toen wist ik al dat het niets zou worden er stond geen team nu wel
2415908 ik ben hier slechts om hun water en handdoeken aan te reiken
2415909 we hebben weinig olympisch kampioenen of nba kampioenen in de gelederen maar wel uitsluitend winnaars drie jaar geleden zijn we samen aan dit project begonnen en daardoor is er cohesie ontstaan er staat nu cht een team in vergelijking met vier jaar geleden is er een andere sfeer andere spelers en bovenal een andere mentaliteit we beseffen allemaal dat de spelen veel groter zijn dan de nba hier vechten we niet alleen voor onze ploeg onze stad of onze staat maar voor ons land
2415910 iedereen in het team begrijpt dat we hier niet zijn om te feesten en te stappen maar om goud te winnen
2415911 en dat kan alleen als we het beste in onszelf naar boven halen
2415912 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2415913 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2415914 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2415915 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that

2415919 we urge the chinese to do what other countries have done to sanction to put a financial squeeze on the burmese generals
2415920 but anyone could argue that those are normal cat traits the biggest hint i have that max is not from this world is his abnormal reaction to catnip most cats when exposed to this herb become excited euphorically sniffing rolling around shaking their heads and rubbing against things even lions and tigers have this catnip response not max
2415921 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2415922 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2415923 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
2415924 what clinched it for us was that the name mihai means who is like the lord
2415925 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
2415926 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming
2415927 these are terrific compilations of early 20th century popular music and provide a glimpse of the times
2415928 hes not in the team now hes traveling to greece where i imagine he will ask for the b sample to be tested
2415929 gousis finished eighth in the 200 at last years world championships in osaka japan he competed in the 2004 athens olympics but failed to qualify for the 200 final
2415930 we have more and more tests in the last six months
2415931 the greek olympic committee decided that each athlete must have three doping tests before coming to the games more tests more positives one day everybody will be clean
2415932 this is a greek affair handled by the greek authorities
2415933 the ioc testing program began on july 27 with the opening of the village competitors can be tested at any place and at any time including the athletes village in beijing and training sites abroad
2415934 it would be stupid for me to take a banned substance just before the games
2415935 we have been informed that there is a positive result involving one of our athletes
2415936 the athlete will be recalled and suspended pending tests on the second sample
2415937 there will be further statements after the test results are finalised
2415938 the olympics happen once every four years all the athletes prepare very hard for the competition the audience watch the competition knowing its a rare occasion and she deliberately takes actions that violate the rules and disturbed other people
2415939 we think her action is very irresponsible so we dont welcome her to return to this venue to watch any other events
2415940 democracy and human rights are more important than the olympics
2415941 the man was asked to take off the shirt before entering the venue
2415942 the first set i won 6 3 but i really didnt feel super comfortable
2415943 the second set was probably the first really good set i have played in four months i started to move the ball around well so that was a really good feeling
2415944 i think this match could be one that i look back on as a turning point in the year
2415945 i made a couple of mistakes the guy started to feel much more comfortable on the court and the momentum was gone
2415946 i didnt serve very well in the third set and the balls are pretty slow so it was difficult for my game i could not change it by serving and volleying it was perfect for him because he was playing very simple tennis
2415947 yes it would be good if i am but i am not going to shoot myself if i am not
2415948 oh fuck i got it all over her fucking desk
2415949 oh fuck i got it all over her fucking desk

2415953 a great writer is so to speak a second government that is why no regime anywhere has ever loved its great writers only its minor ones
2415954 tolstoyism was a kind of non church religion propounding that the kingdom of god resides within each human soul and that the way to a true knowledge of christ and to salvation was through individual conscience and love rather than the strictures of an organized church tolstoy preached moral betterment by means of restricting human appetites and simplifying life his ultimate goal was to transform the whole of russia including the intelligentsia into a community of peasants satisfying their own basic needs through manual work on their own land tolstoyism was one of the countrys most popular ideological movements at the turn of the century and reached its crest with tolstoys death in 1910
2415955 so let us come to our senses in time let us change our course
2415956 they hounded the men who said that it was perfectly feasible for a colossus like russia with all its spiritual particularities and folk traditions to find its own particular path
2415957 economic growth is not only unnecessary but ruinous we must set ourselves the aim not of increasing national resources but merely of conserving them we must renounce as a matter of urgency the gigantic scale of modern technology in industry agriculture and urban development the cities of today are cancerous tumours the chief aim of technology will now be to eradicate the lamentable results of previous technologies
2415958 we need to heal our wounds cure our national body and national spirit let us find the strength sense and courage to put our own house in order before we busy ourselves with the cares of the whole planet and once again by a happy coincidence the whole world can only gain by it the village for centuries the mainstay of russia has become its chief weakness for too many decades we have sapped the collectivized village of all its strength driven it to utter despair
2415959 like other major novelists solzhenitsyn makes his own experience the centre of his literary work and the point of departure for its symbolic significance the concentration camp and the cancer ward are for him places in which to reflect not just on the problems presented by extreme situations but on the wider questions of soviet reality and of our epoch of good and evil in short of la condition humaine like other great novelists he is uncompromising in his attitude to truth and he restores to russian literature the moral universalism which had been lost during the stalin era his writing is philosophical in the traditional sense with its complexity and sense of tragedy it is the antithesis of the shallow optimism and vulgar sociologism which under the sign of socialist realism has for so many years dominated soviet prose writing

2415961 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam

2416012 i had these one liners like comedy is in my blood its a shame it isnt in my act did i get a good reaction not really no
2416013 theres a connection between writing songs and comedy its about getting to the point a good joke or song can be screwed up by adding one if or but you cant meander its all about compression
2416014 when i was asked to write ben for michael jackson i knew it had to be about a rat but i didnt want to write about cheese and traps so i made it about friendship the same with born free i knew i couldnt write about lions and cages so i made it a social comment youve got to be open to universal themes

2416026 ho detto che mi sentivo come se la stessi scavalcando ma non la vidi mai capite questo il modo in cui mi hanno presentato e non mi piaciuto cos ho detto loro di rimuovere la mia intervista se credo che il nostro governo farebbe una cosa del genere alla propria gente no sinceramente non lo credo io so che ero l dentro ho sentito quello che ho sentito visto quello che ho visto

2416030 non c alcun modo in cui questo complotto per abbattere il wtc7 avrebbe potuto accadere
2416031 non mimporta che esperienza del cazzo in originale ha non mimporta e una persona che fa parte del sistema e ovvio che vi dir cose di questo genere
2416032 immagino che ognuno abbia diritto alla propria opinione mi fa un po rabbia perch io ero l ho sentito parlarne gente che veniva da cincinnati e dalla california e da dovunque venga questa gente io ero qui voi no credo che non abbiano alcun rispetto per gli amici che ho perso e per tutte le persone che sono morte quel giorno come uno schiaffo in faccia
2416033 i complotti possono sempre essere pi emozionanti della realt perch ci puoi sempre aggiungere qualcosa sono un ottimo materiale per i romanzi e anche a me piacciono i buoni romanzi ma quando si tratta della vita reale credo che dobbiamo sapere che un lato della pagina la vita reale e laltro fantasia e bisogna tirare una riga di demarcazione fra le due cose e vivere nel mondo reale godersi i racconti di fantasia in quanto racconti di fantasia

2416053 first of all disco clubs were known for taking anyone in regardless of age race sexuality gender etc it was like this because the performers themselves were so varied black white straight gay secondly rock amp roll was alive and well in the late 70s just ask patti smith iggy and the stooges ac dc etc

2416080 awami league is pledge bound to the nation to hold upazila elections within one or two months if it goes to power it is the caretaker governments responsibility to hold national elections
2416081 you prove your neutrality hold an acceptable election and transfer power
2416082 give up thought of holding upazila elections withdraw the state of emergency and fulfil peoples expectations by holding an acceptable national election
2416083 back off from the process of depoliticising politics by giving up upazila elections
2416084 the government wants to hold upazila polls and defer national elections on any excuse
2416085 but awami league is committed to holding upazila elections if it assumes power so why is the government so pressed about the upazila elections
2416086 delegates from different districts on the sidelines of the main discussion on the partys political organisational and future course proposed the four resolutions that have been adopted and approved
2416087 we protested the ewg decision of working as an agent of the ec to take voters to the registration centre because we believed such work would hamper the independence of election monitoring
2416088 we worked as the agents of the donor the asia foundation not of the election commission
2416089 janipop was first in favour of assisting in the ecs awareness campaigns by taking people to voting centres but later it refrained from taking in part in such activities and only acted as observers
2416090 it is not possible to be agents and evaluators at the same time it is not moral so we observed the polls only
2416091 once you sign a mou with the election commission you work under the commission
2416092 the election working group did sign the mou with the ec to take voters to the registration centres
2416093 the asia foundation through the ewg spent about 2 million in assisting the election commission in the voters registration programme
2416094 as the voter list was prepared with photographs voters could cast their ballots easily this time
2416095 but they would have felt more at ease if there were no state of emergency
2416096 an environment for spontaneous voting has to be created by withdrawing the state of emergency before parliamentary elections
2416097 the local government elections have been very fair and transparent people could cast their own ballots without hindrance
2416098 if there were no state of emergency the election would have been a more joyful and spontaneous affair
2416099 so we do not want to see the state of emergency during the next parliamentary election
2416100 there is no alternative to an elected government so the quicker the parliamentary election is held the better for the country
2416101 i believe if the leader is released the division in the party will disappear an election cannot be won by a divided party

2416115 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
2416116 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
2416117 placebo can affect patients response to pain therapy and also influence the results of clinical trials
2416118 we have shown that responses to experimental placebo alter how the brain responds to pain and also that responses to experimental placebo persist in repeated testing in healthy volunteers
2416119 we hope this study will help us understand how the brain deals with pain and is also likely to lead to the development of new pain killing therapies and better ways of testing then
2416120 its all about allocating working memory to the things that are most important
2416121 when something grabs our attention we automatically divert some of our working memory to it in case it turns out to be important in other words it gets the lions share of memory resources
2416122 when we look at a scene we dont remember every detail only the broad gist and one or two specific details
2416123 we allocate very small portions of our memory to the background and far more to the important details if you test people you find that they have very little knowledge of the details of what they just saw because their visual memory is so limited
2416124 limited memory puts clear limitations on what we actually see rather than what we think we see seeing involves looking at objects and storing them briefly in our working memory but that memory is incredibly small so what we actually see is extremely restricted our vision is determined not just by what we look at but by our memory of the scene
2416125 when we decide to look at an object we clearly perceive it as being significant and reallocate our memory to it
2416126 so even though we havent looked at it yet we still remember more about it than the object weve just looked at
2416127 part of the reason these patients may not be aware of objects is because they have very severe limitations in their visual working memory capacity
2416128 without memory devoted to some parts of the visual field patients dont see objects there

2416136 we knew track position is important in this race its everything
2416137 that extra stop for the cut tire basically cut our chances of winning the race during my stint i was able to work my way up to seventh behind the 16 which was strong and i had not enough to overtake him that was basically it at the start we were all in agreement that in those conditions we would start on wets it was a gamble sometimes it works sometimes it does not at the end the car was really fast so i wonder what would have happened if we didnt have to make that extra stop for the cut tire that makes me feel very bad
2416138 the car was handling well all weekend especially in the last practice session on friday night so i felt we had a potential race winning car
2416139 it was a 50 50 gamble at the start whether to go with rains or slicks it turned out slicks were the way to go so we pitted early which dropped us back we worked our way back up to seventh but then while i was passing tracy krohn he sideswiped me just a little bit and it ended up putting a slice in the tire so i had to pit again and at the time it was raining so we put max in the car and put on wets again he made up a lot of track position by running some really fast laps while everyone else out there was on slicks in the wet but we had to stop one more time for fuel and slicks when the track finally dried and that set us back once again and that was really it for us
2416140 our result did not show how fast our car was this weekend contact caused a slow leak and that set us back and thats all she wrote well be back with a vengeance at sonoma

2416180 we go out there and i know that chris cunningham crew chief has a number in his head that he wants to run and when the car doesnt run that youve got to come back and re evaluate what caused it
2416181 you have to see if it was too much clutch ignition motor there are a multitude of things that go into a tune up and you could see today because a lot of cars struggled at some point getting down the track
2416182 we went nine or 10 races in a row making really good runs friday night and then we would struggle in the heat
2416183 now its kind of been a role reversal and we seem to run better in the heat and not as well at night
2416184 we really did accomplish what we wanted to in the first run because we were in the back half of cars to go down the track that second run and we were able to see what everyone else ran the car drifted slightly out of the groove and i made a slight correction to try and get it back but we focus on tomorrow weve got two runs with very good conditions and well take that data and use it on sunday

2416188 if youve got a good car you can move ahead as the race goes on even if you have a bad pit stop and fall back if youre fast you can get back to the front it will be more of a pack race than the ones weve had lately where we get strung out
2416189 the car unloaded really fast and we didnt do much to it
2416190 we wanted to emphasize our qualifying effort and we capitalized on what we can do now its time to go forward and think about the race

2416228 if it wasnt for the guys and all the hard work they do i wouldnt be doing so well theyve been working so hard i think our team is really coming together as a group everybody is pulling in the same direction were getting into the swing of things im learning more and more every time i drive one of these trucks im also getting the chance to go and test the cup cars with the sprint cup drivers that roush fenway has and that has been a huge help for me i think some of it is just the new attitude weve got were doing like my crew chief says were doing the best we can and whatever happens happens were not so worried about going out there and win races like we were before were just going to go out there and have fun we all know what to do and we know how to do a good job so if we go out there and have fun i think thats going to get us some better results compared to what weve been having
2416229 i dont really know its so different driving one of those nationwide cars here just the way youve got to get on the brakes the package that we brought with my no 16 citifinancial ford fusion was a lot different than what my crew chief brought here in the no 6 con way freight ford f 150 its hard to compare
2416230 i think so just having some experience here and having some laps here and knowing what the little nuances of this place are definitely helps me for sure we just brought really different package

2416233 the car just took off in the corner and into the wall i went the damage isnt heavy but enough to send it to the house this weekend at nashville superspeedway we dont have any laps on the backup before qualifying but it is the same piece we tested with last month im confident that the sheltra motorsports bunch will have it in tip top shame come tomorrow morning to give us a solid starting spot
2416234 they were two totally different tracks so to run well at both is a big boost to me and my guys
2416235 my car just wasnt handling very well in the first half of the race
2416236 it was like a totally different car the second half of the race
2416237 i would have liked even another five laps and i think i could have had a top three finish but ill definitely take 4th
2416238 anytime you can move up in points its a good day
2416239 the points are all so close though that its important to keep running well
2416240 itll be a lot of work but also a lot of fun theyre all different tracks so hopefully we can just keep running well
2416241 we are thrilled to team up with yates racing and with a driver like david
2416242 this partnership expands our presence in racing building on our successful nationwide series program and enables us to reach even more customers and engage even more employees in the excitement of nascar davids had some great runs this year and we are looking forward to rooting him on
2416243 this is another great sponsor for our yates racing organization
2416244 doug yates has had a relationship with citifinancial since the 2004 season this is a great partnership for our yates racing team and im honored that citifinancial has chosen to be the primary sponsor of our no 38 team for four races
2416245 i was excited on one hand but i was nervous on the other
2416246 i would have liked to have a bigger points lead prior to the final two races but we were able to pull it off and win the championship
2416247 i was just driving for points i wasnt going for wins at that point
2416248 i knew where i needed to finish so i just paced myself on the track i ended up getting shuffled to the outside and settled in to fifth and that is where i stayed
2416249 i want to congratulate him and his team on winning the final race and having a great season
2416250 we are the youngest driver to win the young guns title i cannot be happier i have to thank my parents my nana and my team for their hard work this season also i have to thank all of my sponsors for their support including mountain dew sevierville import and truck center chambers market bakers wrecker service d amp s builders and prestige car wash this championship is theirs as much as it is mine and i cannot thank them enough for their support of my racing career this is just awesome
2416251 it was an amazing experience it was my first time on the field it was an emotional feeling for me hes one japanese player on that team and im one japanese driver in the indycar series
2416252 after a welcome weekend off its time for the stretch run to the championship with four races in five weeks we kick it off at kentucky speedway another of the mile and a half oval that promotes the intense tire to tire racing for which the indycar series is known firestone is bringing a new tire to kentucky that is expected to increase grip and ratchet up the excitement another notch or two indycar series teams and drivers have relied on firestone to provide reliable and race worthy tires since the first event in 1996 we take great pride in that trust and take quite seriously the responsibility to continue developing those trustworthy race tires
2416253 over the years here at kentucky ive been fast i was on pole in 05 when i finished 16th i had a gearbox problem i decided that i would take it apart and blow it up when i was getting ready for a pit stop but i was really quick the second year was my best finish which was probably when ive had the least chance of doing well here and then last year i think i was running third or fourth when i came in something like that and i spun coming out of pit lane and then the near collection of the safety truck i was pretty close because the tire blew out because i was running on a blistered tire so ive had some bad luck here but in the past ive been fast so i hope i can continue that and obviously have some good luck
2416254 edmonton was a weekend that i think wed all like to forget it was definitely a difficult one we were struggling all weekend and we just werent able to come through in the race either there were issues across the board i lost my radio pretty early in the race i lost it when tony kanaan was behind me they the team asked me how do you know when to stop i stopped because i saw i had 15 on my fuel meter and i can go to 20 weve gone through things enough in the briefing before the race so i felt prepared if this does happen because i could only imagine in my mind what a mess it would be if it did finally unfortunately happen which to me was disappointing its about keeping our heads down its about focusing harder when things are difficult its not a time to turn away its a time to jump in deeper and work even harder were all just going to need to work together as closely as possible and make progress thats been a b ig strength of the team over the years there were obviously some th ings that happened at edmonton outside of speed that were problems but its ok were through it
2416255 it was nice to have a break i think everyone recharged their batteries after the long six weeks i actually want to get going because we are very close to getting our first win of the season were trying everything we can but the good news is were still in the hunt for the championship a lot has started happening in the series which is great kentucky speedway is always a very difficult track because its a very fast oval were running 217 218 miles per hour and the banking is not high not like at some places such as homestead for example or texas or chicago but we are still able to go flat out but there are also some challenges there are some bumps which is great for us great for the drivers we have to work on balance in those circumstances im looking forward to this weekend and hopefull y well be in good shape
2416256 i wouldnt change anything that weve done so far in this championship just because we havent won a race this season doesnt mean that we havent been competitive were second in the standings in the championship weve shown that were fast weve shown that were consistent and weve shown that we are right up there weve been using the right strategy and have done everything we can there are even sometimes that we take chances to win a race and im currently in second place the point is our team is fast im very confident with my guys now its just a matter of keep knocking on the door ive been saying that all season knock on the door and one day that door will open im going to push the door open break the door weve got to keep the same strategy were not g oing to change weve got four more races to go and w e ve got to not just chip away at the championship
2416257 i heard peyton is still in bed i worked really hard in rehab in the last week so i could be in car this weekend and have a chance to move up in the championship standings
2416258 it was no surprise for anybody it has been an eventful week with a lot of rumors and a lot of things that people come up with and i have no idea where it is coming from this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago what can i say but i am very proud of this team for sure i am very excited about it and it obviously means a lot to me it means that what they have done in the past and what i have done in the past can happen again and make my dreams come true i have one more thing to do for this team and that is to win the indianapolis 500 and now i have five more tries so hopefully it can happen one of these years
2416259 were really excited to have this done we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake for us that was basically him being a part of the family as long as he has that was as quick as it was the rest was just trying to get it on paper it was nice to get that finished and put an end to all the rumors tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family there was never a question in our mind that tony was going to be with us for a long long time were very happy that weve finally put it to bed
2416260 this really started last fall we had a lot of discussions about not only spending his driving career here but what tony wants to do after hes finished driving those were the kind of discussions that we had with him tonys been with us since the start and we really consider him one of the founding parts of andretti green racing hes spent his career with us he gave us our first pole and our first win and our first championship thats the kind of relationship that weve had like most families once in awhile we have our squabbles but i promise you that the guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport theres no one like tony on race day hes a team player and thats really what his contract recognizes
2416261 i am very excited with the partnership of lucas new line of racing oils and swe i was at the dyno test performed by xtrac gear and was impressed with the results of xfr forrest lucas not only showed up for the test but he took it upon himself to hand blend the oil that dyno tested with outstanding drag and temperature results creating xfr
2416262 its a very proud moment those are the things i never thought about when i was competing i guess when you get to the end of your driving career and are recognized for what youve done its a pretty proud moment and to be in there with my father who is the greatest of all time and who will be introducing me it will be a very special night
2416263 its very important to start up front at this track because its so difficult to pass we tested here a couple weeks ago and we had great speed it feels so good to put everything together and get the pole i was a little bit concerned because we went out so early but the entire afs andretti green team worked so hard all day it feels so good to bring the boys the pole
2416264 every point is important in this championship it could be decided by 10 points or just one point so you have to get every point you can its good to get the pole tomorrow i just want a clean race so i can get as many points as i can
2416265 today was great we just keep improving the car the healthy choice and sam schmidt crew we work great together and we are so confident in ovals and still improving it is really tight here in kentucky and we will have to see what is going to happen tomorrow we have put ourselves in a position that i think we can get a second win but we will have to improve the car before the race because the andretti green car is really fast i have to thank my sam schmidt team for teaching me all they know about ovals they are very experienced on ovals i am pleased to be starting on the front row because it is very hard to pass here i just need to find a way to get around raphael matos
2416266 starting in the second row isnt a bad place to be starting it is a little disappointing though we looked good on the first lap but just slowed a little on the second i will definitely be going for the win this race we havent finished the last few races but that wont stop me from going for the win we have been strong on ovals all year so i expect us to be extremely strong for tomorrow and contend for the win we are going to try to move forward hopefully we will have a setup that allows us to do that
2416267 it felt good we were lacking about a tenth of a second a lap the car felt good the speed just wasnt there i said going into qualifying that id be satisfied with a top five happy with a top three and over the moon with the pole at least im satisfied i dont know what more i could have done you cant win all of them
2416268 dan wheldon was struggling earlier today and i was certainly hoping he good be a bit better maybe one spot better but not faster than me its a good starting position for team target to be 1 and 3 i have to thank the team a lot they have certainly prepared great cars especially in qualifying we just have to worry about our line for the qualifying laps and it worked out our race car is very similar to our qualifying setup hopefully we can lead a lot of laps gain a lot of points and close in on that championship
2416269 i think we did really good thats where we were struggling a little bit on qualifying the delphi panther national guard car did really really good we kept improving were still a little bit off but any day youre mixed up there with the ganassis it has to be a good day since theyre on a role here im pleased and i hope that tomorrow goes as well as today did
2416270 it was a good run out there there are four races left and i want to finish for the team very strong and thats what im focused on they can expect a very strong effort from the no 10 car tomorrow night scott dixon has been very quick and thats what the benchmark is for tomorrow
2416271 the formula dream car has been very consistent and easy to handle this weekend so i am very with the car i wish my time was a little faster but i hope i will be able to stay close to the front i won the indy lights race here last year so i hope the race tomorrow will be a good one as last year
2416272 the team penske car feels really solid and it has a nice balance we probably couldve gotten a bit more speed out of it but im certainly happy with where we are i think we have a great car and we should be in good shape for the race tomorrow
2416273 today was rather difficult in the early going for the no 3 team penske crew the car felt really solid during the practice sessions but we didnt seem to have the speed of the leaders and we couldnt figure out why that was my engineer made the decision right before qualifying to make some changes to the car that seemed to work for us and we ran our fastest lap of the day were pretty happy with our starting position and our race car works really well in traffic so well do our best to stay out of trouble and bring home another good result in hopes of keeping the championship battle alive
2416274 i dont think our qualifying run was strong enough today but it is a long race so im not worried we had the misfortune of totaling a car here last week during a test with rafa raphael matos and that cost us a lot unfortunately this team 7 eleven car doesnt have all the nice pieces we need for a superspeedway so were just hanging in there right now
2416275 consistency is always good for a driver to have and those were some pretty consistent laps 0 0033 of a second variance per lap but i really need to thank my vision guys i wasnt really happy with my car in that last practice and thanks to my teammate a j foyt iv for his input and my crew guys for putting in some hard work to change the menards car completely for qualifying as a result we went faster in qualifying than ive been all day theres a lot of teamwork going on around here and hopefully well see it pay off
2416276 my run was quite easy because there wasnt a lot more to go from a downforce standpoint unfortunately we just didnt have the speed today in qualifying im confident that the meijer car will do the tow as it showed today in practice it will do a good time and we know we have a good race car
2416277 this track has always been good to us we had a great race here last year and this weekend weve had a really good car since we unloaded it so im expecting to have a great run in the no 2 lilly car tomorrow the first qualifying lap held us back a little or wed have run a bit faster i think

2416300 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2416301 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2416302 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2416401 i would like to hear about your little adventure rhodium
2416402 but im sure it can wait until you have both rested
2416403 and i would like to get pallas and the girls home this has been very exhausting for her
2416404 well i think we should all head home im really tired
2416405 i can fill you girls in on the whole story tomorrow and hear all about jess magic
2416406 i want to talk about this time traveling spell it is making me a little afraid now that we know it really works
2416407 its still hard to believe this little adventure of ours really happened
2416408 it was a bit perplexing i must agree but pallas
2416409 you actually performed the time travel spell no other wizards have been able to pallas almost blushed
2416410 well i dont know about it being so great rhodium it just worries me a bit the possible danger the consequences of it
2416411 i can now understand why the second part of the spell was hidden
2416412 okay i do want to be there when you tell asquith and the others
2416413 rhodium i mean it this time i need to get to my job and have somewhat a normal life again please understand that desire of mine has not changed
2416414 look i know im always gonna have some kind of magic around me i i accept that i just want a little time to learn how to have what i want and deal with the magic
2416415 is everything alright my boy with pallas and the girls
2416416 rhodium did anything happen while the two of you were back in time
2416417 asquith pallas was amazing she took control even through her fear she never gave up on bringing us back home
2416418 so much power she has and so crafty at times
2416419 pallas does have the talent my boy she truly is the protector and not only of the escape but of all those who she has taken into her life
2416420 she wants a break from the magic asquith pallas means it this time
2416421 yes i can understand her saying that this has been quite shocking to her i suppose magic suddenly thrust into her life finding out her ancestor was a great wizard and is now appearing out of thin air talking to her that she is now the great protector of the escape and must battle it out with an enemy that she never knew existed oh yes and she traveled back through time accidentally uncovering the spell required to do so that no other wizard has been able to accomplish
2416422 yes pallas just might think that she needs a holiday from all this rhodium
2416423 pallas will need all her strength to combat whatever is to come next with the insurgent and i fear it may be more difficult than the last time
2416424 let her have her rest do not force but gently guide her my boy pallas will need you do not ever doubt that and i believe pallas will not deny herself or us what she must do to complete her part in the destiny of the escape
2416425 yes she is very concerned about the time traveling spell falling into the wrong hands
2416426 i believe i have made a discovery in regards to that

2416432 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2416433 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2416434 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2416435 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2416436 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2416437 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2416438 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2416439 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2416440 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2416441 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2416442 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2416443 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2416451 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2416452 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2416453 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2416454 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2416455 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2416456 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2416457 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2416458 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2416459 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2416460 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2416461 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2416462 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2416463 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2416464 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2416465 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2416466 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2416467 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2416468 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2416469 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2416470 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2416471 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2416472 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2416473 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2416474 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2416475 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2416476 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2416477 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2416478 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2416479 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2416480 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2416481 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2416482 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2416483 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2416484 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2416485 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2416486 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2416487 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2416488 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2416489 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2416490 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

2416500 i didnt hit many fairways therefore i didnt hit many greens so i never had chances for birdie
2416501 there was a lot of bad rhythm its easy on the range much harder on the course it didnt really fall into place at all
2416502 its easy to time it on the range not so easy on the course i played terrible and the way this course is set up you cant afford to do that
2416503 since the players its been just a wasted time for me
2416504 the roughs just ridiculously long especially around the greens its just not golf at all you miss hit a shot and then just hack it out
2416505 theres nothing wrong with tough but some fairness is required it doesnt give you a chance if youre not hitting a fairway
2416506 when youve got narrow fairways and theyre firm you cant have long rough like that
2416507 im told that it came up beautifully on television it was designed so that the lighting would lift the thing very well
2416508 i could have gone out in a paper bag or a hessian bag as long as it had australia on it or olympic rings
2416509 theres an unprecedented amount of sport that will be covered in the coming days with 1 000 cameras making some 5 000 hours of coverage
2416510 as the resplendent olympic flame lit up the night over the birds nest the world not only saw a modern china that embraces a 5 000 year old ancient history but a fully confident strong and wise china
2416511 this rare night in beijing will become an important page in the history of world civilisation
2416512 the beijing olympic games is a new starting point for human civilisation to move toward the future now the expectation is for a more open china to make greater contributions to humanity
2416513 the pride of beijing is that we have fulfilled the commitments made to the international community for a successful beijing games we are also proud of beijing because beijing has not let down the expectations of 1 3 billion chinese
2416514 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2416515 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2416516 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2416517 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2416518 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2416519 the contract with america outlined our platform of limited government this vision appealed to both the social and economic wings of the conservative movement equally important it included institutional reforms for a congress that had grown increasingly arrogant and corrupt the contract nationalized the vision of the republican party in a way that unified our base and appealed to independents we championed national issues not local pork projects or the creature comforts of high office
2416520 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2416521 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2416522 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2416523 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2416524 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2416525 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2416526 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2416527 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2416528 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

2416536 this is going to alleviate the headache but it may cause dry mouth bad breath runny nose diarrhea lime disease backache stomachache shortness of breath and a long list of illnesses known to men
2416537 well this will fix that pesky pop up problem that you have been having but there are possible side effects including the possibility of infected by a virus you might lose some of the data your files may become corrupted and a long list of other side effects including but not limited to a hard drive failure
2416538 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2416539 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2416540 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2416541 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2416542 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2416543 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2416544 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2416545 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2416546 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2416547 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2416548 who are open to doing something on the production side
2416549 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2416550 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2416551 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

2416555 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2416556 as soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations

2416699 i lost my faith in xforms as a widely accepted standard supported by all browsers on all platforms
2416700 when i first saw source code for rails it didnt make much sense to me
2416701 a large majority of software geeks make the world think that the main purpose of software is instructing the computer to perform series of actions this is a crucial mistake the main purpose of software is communication between people
2416702 although very different both xforms and ror are solutions to the same flaws
2416703 considering the additional effort required to handle the server side aspects of xforms it comes nowhere near the ror framework
2416704 xforms logic beats any other technique when used in xml documents with semi structured nature
2416705 for someone with the knowledge and experience of a software architect the simple tools in xforms can be the building blocks of a very advanced and intelligent application
2416706 a key design choice in rails is to do every aspect of the app in ruby and avoid writing even a single line of javascript or sql
2416707 in my earlier xforms tutorial i learned that i can push the logical model way beyond anything i have seen in a browser so far
2416708 subscribers of my weblog may have noticed that im not a big fan of ajax but consider it a necessary evil for usability sometimes
2416709 choosing open source software it is easy to forget about the commercial aspects because its free anyway
2416710 while i was waiting for xforms the only thing i did with ajax was to criticize it
2416711 rails wins easily when it comes to innovation and buzzword compliance
2416712 the xforms concept was born from a vision but it is being implemented like a mandatory school assignment the key advantages of xforms have an academic nature this is the exact reason why i like them myself it is also the exact reason why it fails in the real world
2416713 ruby on rails is based on clear vision and goals and implemented accordingly
2416714 ruby on rails is a role model example for pragmatism
2416715 for me right now i prefer ruby on rails over xforms

2416719 being in work is known to boost your confidence and self esteem it enables you to socialise with like minded people and earn your own income which can be incredibly rewarding
2416720 in addition as the findings of this poll suggest being in work can benefit your children by setting them a positive role model these days employers are aware of the need to be flexible so if you have children dont worry it is possible to enjoy the benefits of work and still spend time together as a family
2416721 previous research has shown that a childs risk of developing asthma is lower if he or she is exposed to bacteria or bacterial products in early life probably because it assists in the development of a childs immune system

2416730 i think ive reached a certain level where im considered to be one of the best in the game thats still playing so right now the goal was to make the national team and finish in the top three but since i didnt do that and i came really close its almost more disappointment than if i had just lost early on
2416731 it was a choice that nobody else in the tournament had done i usually do play a lot of unique cards like theres a 3 mana 4 4 that cant block that most people dismissed and there was a 3 3 haste available and i played this one instead because i thought it was better against the field
2416732 it feels pretty good i made a lot of really tight plays and thats how i got here
2416733 definitely the people i just have so many friends that i met through this game and i get to see them once a month maybe twice a month at the other tournaments i go to if i was gonna go to san francisco i could call three people and have a place to stay how many people can say that they have friends all over the united states

2416738 i felt like i was a traitor to the quarterbacks because i was breaking it down with the slot backs
2416739 its definitely a gamble but its his last year and he is good enough to be playing for us so we are going to take a chance
2416740 we are going to get him on the field and if he gets hurt at least he got a chance
2416741 were always going to recruit a lot of quarterbacks just from the standpoint where we feel that an athletic quarterback can go play somewhere else
2416742 were not looking for a drop back guy were looking for an option guy and if hes not one of our top three quarterbacks well find a place for him to play on the field
2416743 and because im a quarterback i sometimes overthink things ive still got a long way to go but im definitely at an advantage because ive played quarterback
2416744 i like contact im not one of those quarterbacks whos afraid to get hit
2416745 we were always afraid before because you dont know how good the slot back is going to throw the ball
2416746 but with jarod were planning on putting in a bunch of halfback passes we want to be able to use his strengths
2416747 i would love to be playing quarterback but this is where they said they need me
2416748 if thats what they need me to do then thats what im going to do 100 percent this team is a lot bigger than just me
2416749 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2416750 its kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2416751 i dont think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end thats where i still stand

2416825 you are a beautiful girl charity oconnor and im quite sure your doe eyed teasing is most effective with the schoolboys that buzz around
2416826 i suggest you save your protest for them and this for me
2416827 and you charity oconnor are so vain a perfect match wouldnt you say
2416828 really lord shes sixteen to my eighteen and fends off men like a mare swishing flies was that really necessary
2416829 yes i know im supposed to be taking every thought captive but its not all that easy you know
2416830 people always seem so taken with my green eyes but i dont suppose green with envy is too appealing is it ill get this right i promise in the meantime please forgive me
2416831 little bit so youre the young emily dickinson mrs mallorys been going on about well i am never had a freshman on the staff before mrs mallory told me to take you under my wing
2416832 its a real shame you dont bother to dress that nicely for the good lord
2416833 mother i thought you might be in bed with one of your headaches i didnt want to wake you
2416834 shes too good for the likes of you you know
2416835 her father will its not likely hell want a pauper courting his daughter
2416836 so did your father and you saw where they took him
2416837 but mother its not fair why cant faith do it
2416838 i dont understand why faith cant do it she doesnt have anything else to do
2416839 but mother you know im reading to mrs gerson saturday evening or id be happy to stay with the children
2416840 tell me charity why is it so important youre free on this saturday night in particular
2416841 well theres a dance social at st agathas i was hoping to go thats all
2416842 and with whom will you be going may i ask
2416843 well yes i think so perhaps of course im not definitely sure
2416844 charity weve been over this before neither your father nor i are comfortable with you seeing that mcguire boy hes too old
2416845 yes and thats too old for you and too old for your sister when it comes to the likes of him absolutely not your father will never allow it
2416846 yes shes a good woman who im afraid has let her son get the best of her ever since his father died that boy has been nothing but trouble hes fast charity out for himself and willing to hurt anyone in the bargain you cant possibly see or understand that now because youre only sixteen but mark my words your father and i are saving you a lot of heartbreak
2416847 its true you dont want me entertaining beaus because poor little faith sits home like a bump on a log and couldnt get a suitor if she advertised in the boston herald
2416848 i could have more beaus too if i flirted like one of the cheap girls at brannigans
2416849 you couldnt get beaus if you lined em up and paid em
2416850 at least i wouldnt pay them with favors on the side porch
2416851 is this true charity look at me is this true
2416852 charity i love you but that love charges me with responsibility for your well being and happiness i know you cant understand this now nor do you want to but you must trust us collin mcguire is not the boy for you hes trouble charity behind that rakish smile and irish charm is a young man whose only thought is for himself ive seen you smile and flirt with a number of young lads and i suppose with most young men thats innocent enough but not with him its stoking a fire that could seriously burn you now tell me what happened on the porch
2416853 he he wants me to go to the social and he mother it was only a kiss
2416854 yes and im only your mother charity i love you very much but youll not be going to the social this saturday nor anywhere else for the next month you will come straight home after school each day and complete your studies and you will have the chore of doing the supper dishes for four weeks
2416855 i could certainly do with a little less love mother
2416856 i will never forgive you for what you did you are a wicked evil person and i hope you die an old maid
2416857 stop it charity i mean it i never meant to tell mother anything and you know it but you were so mean and hateful it just popped out
2416858 fine way to prove it i still dont know if im going to forgive you youve gone and ruined everything with collin its going to be twice as difficult to see him now
2416859 but youre not supposed to not now not ever thats the whole point mothers been making dont you understand that
2416860 my head knows it but im afraid my hearts having a bit of a problem
2416861 but you dont quite get it either do you faith i love him its as simple as that mother may forbid me from seeing him but she cant forbid me from loving him
2416862 you cant love him youre sixteen and hes twenty one you dont even know him
2416863 you know the studying ive been doing at the library well ive been studying all right my favorite subject in the whole world
2416864 oh faith hes amazing hes funny and bright and all i know is im happier than ive ever been
2416865 you didnt look so happy on the porch this afternoon
2416866 yes i know he can be maddening at times its part of his charm i suppose but i can handle him
2416867 you didnt appear to be the one doing the handling
2416868 i know what im doing and ill thank you to stay out of it i love him thats all there is to it
2416869 i trust you faith were sisters and sisters love each other right

2416949 were trying to make sure the american people know they have a voice in washington
2416950 when i played the same hole last year i finished about ten or 15 feet short of the green so i knew it was in reach if i could get a good one away
2416951 the line was over the bigger of two trees that jutted out into the fairway i teed it up a little bit higher than normal and just caught it absolutely flush i couldnt have hit it any better
2416952 we set off down the fairway and i was surprised when i couldnt find my ball because i was sure i had hit it on line
2416953 everyone i was playing with just went crazy there were high fives cheering back slapping it was really surreal it just didnt sink it what i had done
2416954 steve was dumbstruck and it takes a lot to shut him up i can tell you we celebrated in some style that evening
2416955 in my 26 years of playing i have never even come close to a hole in one i didnt dream id get one at all so to get one on a par four is just the stuff of dreams
2416956 that is what makes golf the great game it is there are not many professionals that will get a hole in one at a par four yet there is always the chance an amateur like me could do it
2416957 lynsey started having contractions in the morning but we were advised to wait until her waters had broken and the contractions were less than five minutes apart before we headed to the delivery suite at west suffolk hospital
2416958 by late afternoon her contractions had become quite acute and she was in a lot of pain so we were advised to come in
2416959 i began to load the car ready for the drive to the hospital but when i went back inside i found lynsey lying down in the middle of the living room carpet
2416960 she said there was no way she could make it to hospital because the pain was so severe although ive delivered babies before ive never done one on my own and all i could think to do was to call my colleagues so they could come and give me a hand
2416961 while i was on the phone to control lynsey said she needed to push her water still hadnt broken and thats when the amniotic sac which holds the baby while it is in the womb appeared
2416962 i told them what was happening and they suggested i should try and pierce the sac with a safety pin i didnt have one of those and in the end used a kitchen knife
2416963 fortunately the fluid began to flow and about 30 minutes later the head appeared and the baby was delivered in the living room
2416964 lynsey was extremely pleased she didnt have to go into hospital
2416965 in fact originally she wanted a home birth but i said it was too complicated in the end she got her wish even though it wasnt exactly how she wanted it
2416966 because i work for the ambulance service i think i switched to that mode and afterwards it hit me you think oh my god what have i just done
2416967 even though i knew what i was doing it was a relief when everyone walked in it will be a great story to tell jasmine when she is older its a very special sort of bonding process most people take their wives to hospital and if they are lucky will simply stand beside them while theyre delivering so to actually do it myself was amazing
2416968 yes youre a crack head and im taking you to the crack house but youre not going to have the crack you can look but you cant have any

2416974 the motivation behind the anthrax letters was to compel a massive expansion of our so called biodefense program a lot of which expansion is scheduled to open on the site of fort detrick
2416975 i think it is appropriate for the army to respond to the circumstances surrounding the anthrax case to scrutinize their safety procedures quality controls and other policies and practices
2416976 it also seems appropriate to have a similar review conducted by independent experts
2416977 if army experts expressed their willingness to at least deal with those items in conjunction with nas i think that would be a good gesture
2416978 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state

2416982 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2416983 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2416984 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2416985 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him

2417010 my client got a raw deal in the original decision because the counterclaim against him was based on letters he wrote in contemplation of bringing the lawsuit and based on statements he made to kantor

2417013 god is not on the side of any nation yet we know he is on the side of justice our finest moments as a nation have come when we faithfully served the cause of justice for our own citizens and for the people of other lands
2417014 if we pursue this way if we are decent industrious and honest if we so loyally and truly fulfill our duty then it is my conviction that in the future as in the past the lord god will always help us
2417015 freedom and fear justice and cruelty have always been at war and we know that god is not neutral between them
2417016 never in these long years have we offered any other prayer but this lord grant to our people peace at home and grant and preserve to them peace from the f oreign foe

2417044 my friends we must keep on believing that unearned suffering is redemptive we must say to our white brothers all over the south who would try to keep us down we will match your capacity to inflict suffering with our capacity to endure suffering we will meet your physical force with soul force we will not hate you and yet we cannot in all good conscience obey your evil laws do to us what you will threaten our children and we will still love you come into our homes at the midnight hours of life and take us out on some desolate highway and beat us and leave us there and we will still love you run all around the country and send your literature and say that we arent worthy of integration that we are too immoral that we are too low that we are too degraded yet we will still love you bomb our homes and go by our churches early in the morning and bomb them if you please and we will still love you but we will wear you down by our capacity to suffer and in winning the victory we will not only win our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and your conscience that we will win you in the process and our victory will be a double victory we will win our freedom and we will win the individuals who have been the perpetrators of the evil system that existed so long this is the thing that we must say this is the thing that we must do if we do this we will be able to bring into being by the grace of god this new world

2417056 the helicopter came but it was too late he fell a lot of metres he had no chance
2417057 they saw their friend falling from the top to the bottom they could do nothing because when he was falling it was too late

2417089 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2417090 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2417091 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2417092 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2417093 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2417094 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2417095 molto buono la condizione generale del gruppo sta crescendo partita dopo partita anche i giocatori che inizialmente hanno patito di pi gli eccessivi carichi di lavoro stanno pian piano entrando in condizione personalmente ho avuto lopportunit di vedere gli azzurri allopera contro i greci del panionios e nonostante la formazione ellenica fosse molto pi avanti con la preparazione la squadra azzurra con cinismo da grande squadra ha centrato lobiettivo qualificazione che rintengo sia la giusta ricompensa a tutta la programmazione fatta dal ds marino in duri anni di lavoro e per i giocatori il giusto premio per avere rinunciato in parte alle proprie vacanze
2417096 negli ultimi mesi il ds marino mi ha chiesto solo ledesma precisamente quattro mesi fa ma la risposta del presidente lotito fu rnegativa il giocatore era ed attualmente ritenuto incedibile dal club laziale prima dellinteressamento per largentino abbiamo parlato svariate volte di walter lopez terzino con ottimo potenziale del river plate calciatore peraltro dotato di passaporto comunitario che potrebbe vestire lazzurro non precludendo larrivo anche di un altro sudamericano non dotato di passaporto europeo ma a quanto pare la dirigenza pare sia interessata a giocatori che negli ultimi tempi sono apparsi sulle pagine dei quotidiani
2417097 assolutamente no il giocatore questanno rimarr a roma come gi ho annunciato nei scorsi mesi il problema con la propriet sorto sulla questione contrattuale tutti sanno il valore di cristian e ricevere una proposta sullingaggio non allaltezza delle sue potenzialit mi sembrata un presa in giro per questo confermo che ledesma nella prossima stagione ricorrer allarticolo 17 che consente al giocatore di poter andare via ma solo per giocare da un campionato diverso da quello del club di appartenenza quindi non escludo lipotesi spagna ma nel calcio mai dire mai
2417098 direi proprio di no i due giocatori per caratteristiche solo molto diversi ledesma oltre ad avere qualche anno pi di esperienza rispetto a

2417100 per etica professionale difficilmente sono incline a fare nomi se proprio dovessi citarne alcuni direi hernandez under 20 uruguay seguito gi da diverse squadre italiane che ritengo in prospettiva un attaccante da doppia cifra per un campionato difficile come quello italiano e poi wellington giovane brasiliano che pare per sia stato acquistato proprio in queste ore dallhoffenheim poteva essere un grandissimo colpo

2417134 it is inspiring to see the tremendous impact chfs champ program is making to improve life for rwandas orphans and vulnerable children but the unmet needs are still enormous
2417135 i dont remember anything except for those two plays those things are 100 percent unacceptable i am disgusted about those turnovers you cant make excuses for something like that
2417136 after the game i was halfway in tears because i had not been out there in so long like two years
2417137 i was happy just to get the opportunity to play again i was happy and at the same time a little bit nervous i was all over the place
2417138 he looked really good i think we have something special with those three running backs
2417139 a running back should always be low if you have to get that extra yardage thats what you have to do
2417140 we all would like to take a look at this tomorrow i made a couple of good plays but i had a couple of opportunities out there too
2417141 the olympics happen once every four years all the athletes prepare very hard for the competition the audience watch the competition knowing its a rare occasion and she deliberately takes actions that violate the rules and disturbed other people
2417142 we think her action is very irresponsible so we dont welcome her to return to this venue to watch any other events
2417143 democracy and human rights are more important than the olympics
2417144 its the type of thing that gives him security and gives us the direction were going to go here in the future
2417145 those are responsibilities im looking forward to on and off the court i take basketball very seriously and i look forward to putting the team on my shoulders
2417146 luol is not only a terrific player but hes a great person
2417147 i think he has room for improvement and is going to be a big cornerstone of what we do and what this franchise is going to do for a long time
2417148 getting this done and getting him settled was obviously a priority for us
2417149 we got it done before he headed off to great britain to play its just a good day for the bulls
2417150 im excited for the season and i know all my teammates are too what happened last season was something we dont want to go through again

2417188 you know she was getting over it when she started worrying about who saw her
2417189 i am looking to see if anyone can supply a generic template release form that a start up could use for their customer reference program the generic form could be used as a standard release for the customer to participate in a case study success story program they have a very limited legal budget and hope that they wont be forced to reinvent the wheel thanks for any help or insights the collective group can provide
2417190 bill i am seeking a template to use as an example guide for creating a variety of sales tools for our field partners i am seeking a one page template that focuses on customers in a particular industry i conceptualize it having very little product related content and what content is there would relate to the focus industry of the document there would be a number of customers featured 4 5 with a logo name and maybe a short statement or quote from a spokesperson essentially this would be used as a leave behind tool when a prospect as for a personal customer reference and would fill the gap until one is secured in addition a second request around this would be then any tips on the value proposition that others have used to get enterprise level customers to agree to be used on these types of sales tools thanks again for your help david
2417191 our customer reference program team is working on developing a clear value proposition for our customers to support our campaigns
2417192 i would like to ask this forum what they offer to their customers as a valuable
2417193 we had just completed setting up our database infrastructure with it as well as the
2417194 i knew we were going to get some resistance from sales by mandating their accountability of a more formal process around references
2417195 another part of this resistance was their sharing with me their good references because sales had kept their good references close to the vest and were not sharing i knew that i needed to gain their trust i wasnt sure how i was going to deal with that i also wasnt clear on how to measure the effectiveness of our program or how to report on it
2417196 one of the presenters talked about the importance of finding a champion at an executive level a decision maker
2417197 the key with programs like sap and lucent is to focus on a programs impact on sales
2417198 each quarter senior management issues a win loss report i take the report and using our database analyze how many of the wins used some sort of reference activity such as a sales call or a site visit when we started out 16 of wins included reference activity now that figure has more than doubled to 33 and rising sales people are increasingly using our references to close deals that gets attention
2417199 consulting for example had never been involved with references but now im included in their meetings because they know if they recommend a customer where things are going well ill pursue the lead and get the reference in addition theyll refer to our reference database to see whether a customer theyre working with is in the program and make sure to treat them accordingly its a clear win i get invited to the meetings of these groups and get a steady supply of fresh leads and then i get recognition for bringing new references into the fold
2417200 for each customer who joins the reference program i add a note to each of the crm database records to alert everyone in the company who accesses the database that this company is part of the reference program when tech support sees these alerts for example they know to escalate their issues even quicker
2417201 gt 5 new rules of customer references in which i spoke about the level of control that users of a community should have
2417202 especially in the realm of big enterprise software projects like erp and crm have ceased to have much real meaning
2417203 how important was the reference s to closing the deal
2417204 it was absolutely great to hear what our peers and also competitors are doing in terms of their reference program it gave me great ideas on how we could improve the reference program and systems at my firm i appreciated how frank all of the presenters were about down sides in their program because it made me feel relieved to see that we aren t the only ones with various problems also it was great to have the opportunity to speak to them before or after their presentations
2417205 more stronger coffee to be served was a great event thanks
2417206 my vp has asked me to put together some statistical information and then survey the field on our reference program why isnt it being used whats best about it whats missing etc anything you have regarding surveying a sales force would be very valuable
2417207 we are confident we can help and we want to prove it to you
2417208 ok we meet our goals but it wasnt really due to the new technology platform you provided
2417209 we do personalize our website for customers they have to log in using a password which takes them to a homepage that is pretty generic in nature but from there they can click on a link to review the activities completed and rewards available as well as a history of reward redemptions contact me if you want more info
2417210 we teradata do offer a rewards system for our member companies based on the type of activity they complete i e reference call analyst activity media activity etc they are rewarded a set amount of points they can use these points to redeem for registration lodging airfare to our annual users conference teradata education executive seminars and more
2417211 hi everyone curious to see if anyone out there can share any best practices with working with internal stakeholders on the corporate side when filling references and developing reference strategies
2417212 its a hands on museum where you are free to pick up anything you like and look at it for as long as you like
2417213 when youre finished just dust it off and put it back where you found it

2417404 an amazing addition to our staff her r sum is simply put mind blowing
2417405 however what i really liked is in the past year hes made a concerted effort to be a better rebounder and use his size inside to take advantage of matchups

2417411 hes really got unique speed for his size and thats going to help him a lot plus he loves the game and hes always trying to learn i think thats probably my favorite thing about him hes really personal and ready to learn
2417412 i like throwing the ball deep to malcolm he does a good job of not letting the defense put their hands on him hes big and strong and gets off the line

2417414 dan has a lot of talent and body control plus hes fast

2417428 but i could care less about how he trains i know what it takes for me to swim fast and i know what it takes for me to win the gold medal
2417429 i win that race by a body length it was just a really bad day at the office and a really important day at the office like i said before im past it im over it ive got a really good thing going on here and ive having the time of my life
2417430 if anyone can make a mistake its him because everybody is watching him if he makes a mistake slip right on by him like you did me

2417694 a tour like this ups opportunities for the different bands to kind of interact play on each others stages do songs together screw around or whatever that kind of thing
2417695 when it turns into we didnt really know each other in the beginning of the tour but now its like a family and were all doing different songs with each other onstage thats always good

2417827 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2417828 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2417833 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2417834 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2417835 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2417871 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
2417872 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome

2417948 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2417949 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs

2417951 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city

2418001 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
2418002 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
2418003 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it

2418144 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2418145 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2418146 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2418147 nowhere in any event does miller show that detectable fallout equals hazardous fallout there may be a case for that view but it needs better evidence than hazy memories self interested statements or innuendo
2418148 what if that was my house i dont have a shelter id be killed
2418149 i must accept nuclear war as a normative threat and prepare for it every day of my life
2418150 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2418151 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2418152 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2418153 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2418154 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2418157 for a relentlessly unoriginal pandering and predictable two and a half hour revolutionary war epic that white washes slavery chooses exaggerated slow motion action over any interest in historical accuracy and is helmed by a director who has demonstrated little talent for anything but overblown textbook filmmaking the patriot isnt a bad movie
2418158 the root of the problem is that the world community cannot agree on rules for the independence of small regions

2418161 whats fascinating about this study is that you would not expect to find contagious yawning where you did not have self awareness
2418162 you can count the number of seeds in apple but you cant the count the number of apples that can grow out of a seed
2418163 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2418164 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months
2418165 i think its entirely appropriate for a news organization to wait to report a story until they have information that theyre comfortable with reporting
2418166 all i can say is that were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2418167 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2418168 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
2418169 it was the subject of late night talk shows and certainly all over the web
2418170 it was in our culture and in our faces and to act as if it didnt exist would be to ignore reality

2418173 if you want to share with others what you have learned and how you live your life so they can be happy as well
2418174 we believe that this is a substantial opening of pennsylvania avenue to the public
2418175 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2418176 like it would have crossed our minds to let up on the guy just because hes on vacation
2418177 it literally is the same old democratic consultant driven politics
2418178 its the same attempt not to tell a story about the country and the other guy but to prove youre right like an academic debating seminar
2418179 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2418180 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2418181 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2418182 the justice department must thoroughly investigate john mccain and the republican national committees pattern of potentially illegal donations
2418183 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of senator mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
2418184 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry
2418185 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2418186 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2418187 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2418188 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame

2418192 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2418193 the bush cheney administration continues to defy our validly issued congressional subpoenas for information relevant to the politicization of the department of justice by this white house
2418194 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
2418195 the system is supposed to catch and report that sort of information
2418196 i had never heard of any of this before his previous supervisor had never heard of any of this before his current supervisor had never heard of any of this before
2418197 it surely seems as though ivins was a troubled man and something should have picked this up earlier he should have been rescreened and reevaluated in terms of his ability to have the access that he had
2418198 i dont know if all of this will work i have to say that i have to give you straight talk i do
2418199 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2418200 my straight talk would be please dont let this foreign company ruin our part of the world
2418201 im personally calling on john mccain to send rick davis to germany to use his considerable clout with dhl to help save these 8 200 jobs in southwest ohio
2418202 come here to wilmington and come here to ohio and explain the reasons and rationale for their decision
2418203 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2418204 theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
2418205 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
2418206 i spoke to senator clinton this week shes campaigning for me in nevada and florida she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party i think we are going to have a terrific convention as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics of the four days our staffs are in communication my staff with senator clintons staff but i dont anticipate any problems
2418207 if the party is speaking about unity they the clinton delegates believe the only way to unify the party is actually allowing them to vote
2418208 moving beyond the convention if they were not allowed to vote there would be a lot of resentment
2418209 well he said he was above having to answer that question
2418210 made a quick stop at the manger in bethlehem where he was born
2418211 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2418212 if a cricketer for instance suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat which he could do very easily i mean are you going to ban cricket bats
2418213 deaf if you are near there no wonder you are deaf
2418214 are you sure you want to go through with this
2418215 if you stay here much longer you will go home with slitty eyes
2418216 if edwards is the father he was definitely still carrying on the affair with hunter after he knew his wifes cancer was back
2418217 i never say anything bad about the people ive slept with and i never go with married men
2418218 i stood up and started to peel of my clothes right down to my black lace underwear we then ended up making love in all sorts of positions
2418219 as i sat there topless he began to kiss and caress my boobs then i took down his baggy jeans and showed him the time of his life
2418220 i was down in london at a show called the pepsi chart show and i got invited backstage to meet him we got to talking and then i ended up going back to his hotel room it was all a bit of a shock because id never met any celebrities before
2418221 it wasnt until a few days after i told my best friend and he said you should phone the tabloids
2418222 they all just sort of happened i was in hollywood looking for modelling and acting work and i just seemed to end up at the same parties as a lot of celebrities a lot of girls get star struck but ive never been like that so i always ended up going over and talking to them or having a drink with them they key is to get evidence that you can show to the papers so i always get a picture or make sure we swap numbers apart from that its just like a normal one night stand only they are with celebrities
2418223 i would really like to have relationships with some of the famous men ive slept with but it is difficult as they are always too busy so i think i may as well make some money out of it as far as im aware none of the celebrities ive ever sold stories on has ever been angry about it
2418224 my mum doesnt like the fact that i do it
2418225 when i did the first one my mum phoned me and asked me what i was playing at she didnt want me to do it but i told her im in a five star hotel im getting 10 000 and im going to be in the paper she didnt say much after that obviously no mum is going to be happy about it if i had a daughter i wouldnt let her do it
2418226 i know ive done it but i only do it for the money and the publicity its something i have done but i would never want my daughter to
2418227 i usually try not to tell any new boyfriends too much about my kiss and tells i dont think its a big deal and its in the past although when i met kenny i told him i was a kiss and tell girl
2418228 no you did not the first i heard was when i got a phone call telling me you were trying to sell the story on me
2418229 i dont really know how we ended up in a relationship after that i suppose i just really like kenny
2418230 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2418231 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2418232 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2418233 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2418234 its an unusual game because over the years the charity shield has tended to be with ourselves chelsea arsenal and liverpool but this is different and its good for portsmouth
2418235 as a game we have never considered it as do or die
2418236 we have used it mainly for fitness and sometimes in the past we have played players who were never nearly fit we just had to get them minutes on the clock
2418237 on this occasion its more or the less the same and ill play carrick neville and nani because i want to get minutes on the clock for them its a prestige match we played them in a pre season game in nigeria but this is a real game and as we know they had a great season last year
2418238 my father didnt talk about william morris and those people much
2418239 affectionate is not a word i would use about my parents way with each other
2418240 sex wasnt one of my fathers bigger concerns or feelings intellectually though yes they were a good partnership
2418241 it wasnt a place you wanted to be they said that i could leave raf intelligence but i told them i didnt want to as id joined up because i believed in anything i could do against hitler
2418242 the ever so slightly bohemian atmosphere of the flat with its comfy furniture walls covered with greek paintings and the ever burning joss stick was intoxicating
2418243 your room is pink all over im getting sick of pink
2418244 weve had a whole olympic cycle since athens and i think weve improved our working practices and our professionalism
2418245 we now have a model of how to achieve excellence and we all buy into it
2418246 the group of riders that we have now is the best that britain has ever sent anywhere in the world there are some world class athletes and great strength in depth the quality of the staff is also unbelievable theres huge confidence in the camp though were not arrogant or overconfident were just ready to race
2418247 the position of the rider on the bike is absolutely critical
2418248 weve put riders in the wind tunnel and given them real time feedback so they can move their elbows or whatever and see what impact it has
2418249 but if i put him in a wind tunnel he can see for himself that theres an instant drop in drag when he puts his head down or changes the position of his elbows as soon as he sees that he appreciates what an effect it can have on his performance some of the things weve found have been surprising we were always telling riders to get lower and lower on the bike but we found that lower wasnt actually better and weve brought some of their riding positions up
2418250 ultimately the rider is the chairman of the board we just give them information and they decide what to do with it
2418251 the best comparison i can make is to say that going from rowing to cycling was like leaving school and going to university
2418252 its immensely different from the system id been in before it really appealed to me there was a lot of individuality people did different things specific to their event the whole system was based around the individual athletes in rowing it felt as though the athletes were at the bottom of the pile
2418253 we talk about target times target processes and tactical racing plans rather than numbers of medals
2418254 if those target times help us to win medals great but if the opposition turn out better than us then good luck to them if all goes well though i would hope that were competitive for the podium in more than six events
2418255 huge amounts of money are being spent on assisted conception techniques by hopeful couples who do not know that alcoholic and caffeinated beverages are liquid contraceptives sweeteners can prevent ovulation and seemingly innocent foods such as peas rhubarb and soya all inhibit fertility
2418256 where is that coming from and what does it want with me
2418257 mom told me to be home for dinner if i go swimming now i will be late
2418258 i know how you like tiburons cooking so much so i got a recipe from him for your birthday dinner im not sure what its called but it looks good
2418259 i will dont worry i just wont thank him with a hug

2418273 blood drips onto paper with a sound like a snare drum rat tat tat it goes im using those drops they way i used to use my heartbeat as a way to count out a few seconds when im trying to be calm but my heart doesnt beat anymore so i need to find something else to use
2418274 right now its the sound of my blood dripping from my girlfriends mouth onto the newspaper on the floor she s supposed to be swallowing it drinking it and letting it turn her into a vampire so we can be together but nothings happening i dont know why
2418275 i did it the way riki told me you have to do it i took all of her blood first then i cut my wrist open and let everything drizzle into her mouth the way she used to drizzle chocolate syrup onto her ice cream then i sat down and i waited for her to open her eyes again
2418276 en 2006 jai commis une grave erreur de jugement et me suis conduit dune fa on d loyale l gard de ma famille et de mes valeurs les plus ch res

2418290 long just the bodies and they looked like foxes red fur and pointed faces we had lunch at the zoo and really enjoyed the animals we watched handlers letting small children feed baby carrots to the giraffe he was huge but so gentle and he would curl his tongue out to gently take the offering the zoo bridged two islands in the river and was so imaginative in its design it even had a special building with creatures of the night we had to acclimate our eyes before going in to see the very low light animals they were mostly from australia the last few days have been very enjoyable not that the first days were not with the difficulty in sending emails i have lost track of particular days and what we did we went to lake louise on friday it is lovely with the chateau lake louise hotel on the edge of the lake a lot of people visit it every day to gaze across the lake and view victoria glacier which seems very close we read in our tour book that morraine lake was much less visited and for a quiet day we should go there well it was a goat rope being labor day weekend most of calgary were there picnicking and hiking we knew something was up when we approached the parking area and the cars were parking on the side of the road a park employee told us

2418296 someone once said that most jobs are too small for the human spirit
2418297 hi im really interested in your company can you tell me if you have any open jobs in the marketing department
2418298 if you chase two rabbits at the same time you will go hungry
2418299 hey just wanted to let you know i really want the job
2418300 that candidate sent me a really good little love bomb after that final round of interviews
2418301 federal court to decide whether green bay erred by allowing nativity scene atop city hall
2418302 i love favre in new york im thinking about going out and buying a pair of wranglers after the show and may be a holster to put my pistol in because favre is a gunslinger

2418304 green bay man pleads not guilty to defrauding country club of about 2
2418305 hey man that cd you gave me i still think its an amazing album and still listen to it thanks man
2418306 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2418307 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2418308 in terms of politics i do believe that doing anything now is not tenable
2418309 that means actively campaigning for barack obama or having a role at the convention hed be a huge distraction
2418310 as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known
2418311 i wanted to keep this mistake i had made two years previously private
2418312 i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2418313 she was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2418314 there are two problems here one is personal and he and his family will have to work that out and the other is that he apparently lied repeatedly about this
2418315 its tragic for elizabeth and the kids as a serious political candidate it would be very hard for him to be that again or to have a major job in government the lying is a big part of that
2418316 my observation was that he seemed very sincere it never ceases to amaze me how often this happens

2418333 as the resplendent olympic flame lit up the night over the birds nest the world not only saw a modern china that embraces a 5 000 year old ancient history but a fully confident strong and wise china
2418334 this rare night in beijing will become an important page in the history of world civilization
2418335 the age of chinese power dawned in a spellbinding and futuristic curtain lifter which featured 15 000 different types of costume and 14 000 performers 9 000 of them on loan from the peoples liberation army

2418342 were going to need to study this at home i think
2418343 nevertheless in literary and art critical circles there is still a tendency to see postmodern theory and practice either as simply replacing representation with the idea of textuality or as denying our intricate involvement with representation even though much postmodern thought has disputed this tendency
2418344 there is nothing natural about the real and there never was even before the existence of mass media
2418345 the postmodern as i have been defining it is not a degeneration into hyperreality but a questioning of what reality can mean and how we can come to know it it is not that representation now dominates or effaces the referent but rather that it now self consciously acknowledges its existence as representation that is as interpreting indeed as creating its referent not as offering direct and immediate access to it
2418346 a cyborg is a cybernetic organism a hybrid of machine and organism a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction
2418347 liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness the imaginative apprehension of oppression and so of possibility the cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as womens experience in the late twentieth century
2418348 the cyborg is our ontology it gives us our politics
2418349 in the traditions of western science and politics the tradition of racist male dominated capitalism the tradition of progress the tradition of the appropriation of nature as a resource for the productions of culture the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other the relation between organism and machine has been a border war
2418350 machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial mind and body self developing and externally designed
2418351 is about the power to survive not on the original innocence but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world the marked them as other
2418352 our machines are disturbingly lively and we ourselves frighteningly inert
2418353 gender might not be global identity after all even if it has profound historical breadth and depth
2418354 to name a restructuring of work that broadly has the characteristics formerly ascribed to female jobs jobs literally done only by women work is being redefined as both literally female and feminized whether performed by men or women
2418355 indicates that factory home and market are integrated on a new scale and that the places of women are crucial and need to be analyzed for differences among women and for meanings for relations between men and women in various situations
2418356 a major social and political danger is the formation of a strongly bimodal social structure with the masses of women and men of all ethnic groups but especially people of color confined to a homework economy illiteracy of several varieties and general redundancy and impotence controlled by high tech repressive apparatuses ranging from entertainment to surveillance and disappearance
2418357 the profusion of spaces and identities and the permeability of boundaries in the personal body and in the body politic
2418358 the impact of the social relations mediated and enforced by the new technologies in order to help formulate needed analysis and practical work
2418359 a cyborg identity a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities
2418360 it means both building and destroying machines identities categories relationships space stories though both are bound in spiral dance i would rather be a cyborg than a goddess

2418369 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2418370 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2418371 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2418372 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2418373 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2418374 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2418375 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2418376 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2418377 jewish people dont go to our churches and are trying to prevent our children from praying in school to our god
2418378 the issue of faith and reason is really central to the lives of all people who are religious and grappling with a desire to find meaning in their lives it felt like some of those larger issues would be relevant to a show which sort of examines the nature of existence the way lost does
2418379 i think its about not putting things upfront if there are religious issues in the show theyre buried in the background of a show thats essentially sort of an action adventure drama

2418421 in danish society of the early nineteenth century it was almost impossible to break through class barriers almost the only exceptions were a few individuals with unusual artistic gifts
2418422 despite all the recognition and acceptance by the nobility and bourgeoisie in the western world andersen never felt himself to be a full fledged member of any group
2418423 has its hierarchies and social rankings and the psychological dynamics and social organization resemble that of the human world
2418424 after having been ridiculed and persecuted actually ends up just a domesticated bird taking its food from the hands of children
2418425 in the nightingale the bell and the snow queen andersen mocks the creation of grandiose titles and positions to elevate ordinary people to higher social rank
2418426 did not stop him from feeling flattered and honored whenever he received a medal from royal hands
2418427 the wedding celebration at the end of the tinderbox is basically a celebration of the solidification of power by the bourgeois class in the nineteenth century
2418428 a society of extreme divisons between rich and poor squalid crowded torn between culture and barbarism
2418429 copenhagen in the 1820s was a city with a cowed press a ludicrous adulation for royalty a financial subjugation to hamburg and very little trade in the harbor
2418430 its body may have been shattered but not its spirit the spirit of art was on the prowl
2418431 the so called romantic schools in european literature at the beginning of the nineteenth century evinced great interest in the folk tale as na ve literature and as a model for fantastic stories
2418432 andersen lived in an era when old wives tales were in retreat he felt some anxiety about oral storytelling traditions which were rapidly vanishing
2418433 inimitable style his rejection of the conventional literary diction of the romantic era in favor of everyday colloquial language
2418434 andersen replaced the tale with the short story romanticism with realism biedermeier with modernity
2418435 materialism and nihilism are seen as ideologies successfully replacing spirituality and the christian god is completely absent
2418436 andersen was deeply invested in conveying christian messages about immortal souls and eternal life andersen 139
2418437 this episode points up the cult of suffering embedded in andersens stories physical distress and spiritual anguish are a sign of virtue
2418438 the decisive argument which is employed by common sense against freedom consists in reminding us of our own impotence far from being able to modify our situation at our whim we seem to be unable to change ourselves
2418439 it is therefore our freedom which constitutes the limits which it will subsequently encounter
2418440 a choice is said to be free if it is such that it could have been other than what it is
2418441 meaning thereby that i was free that is not only was my act not determined by any thing or person but also i could have succeeded in resisting my fatigue longer
2418442 if i wish to understand under what conditions i can suffer a fatigue as unbearable it will not help to address oneself to so called factual givens which are revealed as being only a choice it is necessary to examine this choice itself and to see whether it is not explained within the perspective of a larger choice
2418443 my companions fatigue is lived in a vaster project of a trusting abandon to nature of a passion consented to in order that it may exist at full strength and at the same time the project of sweet mastery and appropriation sartre
2418444 for the paper cutter essence that is the ensemble of both the production routines and the properties which enable it to be both produced and defined precedes existence thus the presence of the paper cutter or book in front of me is determined
2418445 man exists turns up appears on the scene and only afterwards defines himself
2418446 man is nothing else but what he makes of himself
2418447 if existence really does precede essence there is no explaining things away by reference to a fixed and given human nature in other words there is no determinism man is free man is freedom
2418448 existentialisms first move is to make every man aware of what he is and to make the full responsibility of his existence rest on him
2418449 the fact of not being able not to be free
2418450 we are a freedom which chooses but we do not choose to be free
2418451 the paradox of freedom there is freedom only in a situation and there is a situation only through freedom
2418452 facticity and freedom in the philosophy of jean paul sartre
2418453 well its only a matter of time before they can patch this flaw
2418454 how can anyone in this day and age think they can lie and get away with it
2418455 thank you god i am sorry please help me i love you
2418456 hey theres nothing wrong about being picky im like that too you gotta be picky to get what you want

2418459 hey the girl with the acne is probably more picky since she gotta pick her acne
2418460 no sounds kinda cool at least its not a downgrade
2418461 it would be better for you if its a downgrade though
2418462 you are picky you know why you seem like you want to have the last word
2418463 oh really well go ahead and say something and ill give you the last word go ahead now

2418468 its members realized they had the platform to reach ears not only with their music a fusion of thumping african music and rhythms sweet reggae breezes funk and hip hop but also with their message
2418469 the american hip hop scene had not only made it acceptable but had also made it cool

2418474 when the expansion started everybody involved in this process understood it would be filled right away and that what it comes down to is a real strategic discussion with the trade show owner about what the show looks like
2418475 were not talking about another salt palace expansion but ways to segment this show and using venues around the salt palace
2418476 companies with the longest history are always in the most forward places if you werent in the show last year and everybody comes back which most do theres no place to go but to the outskirts
2418477 every serious retail store has a visit to the new product pavilion on its to do list
2418478 typically on days one and two retailers make appointments with their existing lines but eventually theyll make it here
2418479 no one is coming to save us from this challenge
2418480 there will be no government program it is our responsibility
2418481 young people who grow up without spending time in nature will be less champions about saving the environment or making budget decisions to save forests and wetlands

2418504 the united states is not at the peak of the game that puts us on a different playing field
2418505 the next time products come in the united states that are manufactured overseas and endanger the health and the well being of our citizens that will be the last of those
2418506 i want to tell you i will strictly enforce them
2418507 mccain has rich experiences in foreign affairs and national security areas as well as mature political viewpoints
2418508 if mccain can really become the next u s president he wont be a blank paper for other people to draw on in terms of the countrys foreign affairs
2418509 we could never have a leader like him in china
2418510 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2418511 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2418512 i was there from a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
2418513 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2418514 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2418515 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2418516 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2418517 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2418518 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2418519 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2418520 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2418521 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2418522 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2418523 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified at the convention

2418534 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2418535 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2418536 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2418537 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china

2418556 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2418557 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2418558 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2418559 shock value is really like the now thats what i call music compilation
2418560 thats my goal for this not to showcase me as an artist of course
2418561 right now i have a song with madonna that i didnt put on her album i saved it in case i wanna do one for me
2418562 of course imma do one with beyonc of course imma do one with jordin sparks rihanna its a lot of people imma do one with jonas brothers imma try to have 10 major ones
2418563 jay was really on the last one but he wanted to change the song
2418564 i said look man i gotta put out an album youre killing
2418565 aku adalah damai namun manusia tidak mampu menjagaku lagi banyak berita tentang darah yang terbuang sia sia perangpun menjadi dagangan ah lebih baik aku mati saja biar dunia ini jadi gelap sekalipun
2418566 tal lama kemudian lilin kedua pun menghilangkan nyalanya sehingga malam menjadi agak gelap
2418567 aku adalah cinta aku sudah tidak kuat lagi menyala manusia sudah tidak menganggapku berguna lagi
2418568 setelah lilin ketiga mati malam menjadi semakin gelap dan datanglah seorang anak kecil we lha kok gelap banget ni aku takut kalian ga boleh mati please anak tersebut menagis
2418569 tenag aja selama masih ada aku yang menyala aku dapat menyalakan damai iman dan cinta karena akulah lilin harapan
2418570 everything in my home is organic from cosmetics to cleaners
2418571 they should have thought twice they shouldnt have done it
2418572 i spend a lot of time in reunion which has a similar climate very damp and hot but with a little bit more sun
2418573 i swear i wont go on and then i find i manage to keep as fit as ever this year it got me again i said i might as well have a go and it all went well
2418574 it could be fun and its not far from home
2418575 we urge the chinese to do what other countries have done to sanction to put a financial squeeze on the burmese generals
2418576 this is a broader and more important collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models
2418577 the cells will allow researchers access for the first time to cell types of interest to watch the disease progress in a dish to watch what goes right or wrong well see in the years ahead that this opens the door to a new way of treating degenerative disease
2418578 that is where all of the science will go on over the next many many years
2418579 even though the ips methodology gives us a facile way for making disease specific lines it does not eliminate the value or need for continuing to study human embryonic stem cells
2418580 those are really the gold standard for pluripotent stem cell types they have no genetic modifications and at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue beyond that are going to be extremely valuable tools human embryonic stem cells allow you to ask questions that we never can ask with ips cells
2418581 whether or not were going to be able to figure out how to do it without viruses so we can use the cells therapeutically is as of today an unanswered question
2418582 im confident were going to get there and that within the next year or two we will have several strategies for reprogramming cells without viruses and when that happens we may have cells in our hands that may be valuable for cell replacement therapy
2418583 in these complex genetic diseases were so ignorant at the moment we dont even know if patients who get type 1 diabetes all get it the same way there could be 50 different ways to get type 1 diabetes
2418584 sam and lindsay are unbelievably happy and in a healthy relationship
2418585 and like any couple in love they speak about marriage and the future but right now there is no wedding planned
2418586 it drives me crazy when people on the left talk about
2418587 the three were greeted by supporters after getting off an air china flight in los angeles ending a long day that began when they were dragged away from a crowded square and detained without access to their cell phones
2418588 mahoney said uniformed chinese officers confiscated the banner and escorted them out of the square
2418589 i asked are we under arrest mahoney said they said no i asked can we leave they said no
2418590 during a one hour interrogation the activists said they told chinese officials they intended to return to the square to hold a news conference
2418591 we didnt do anything wrong we were speaking up for the chinese people we refused to pay
2418592 finally chinese officials agreed to pay for the tickets and told the trio they had to leave china immediately or else theyd face extended jail time mahoney said
2418593 it drives me crazy when people on the left talk about
2418594 i think england need to look after that rashid hes still young 19 i think in a few years time hes going to be world class i think he can bat a bit as well
2418595 and the point of this article is to find out what people think
2418596 i dont buy this argument that ambrose got bowled a magic ball that no other batsman could have played its just not the case
2418597 good balls are good balls preciesely because they have a chance of taking wickets
2418598 be careful what you wish for you may just get it

2418605 na mijn bachelor industrieel ontwerpen volg ik nu de master strategic product design aan de tu delft duurzaamheid speelt hierin een belangrijke rol evenals de vraag hoe de onderste klasse van de samenleving ook van goede producten kan worden voorzien ik zou dit graag willen toepassen met dit project
2418606 na succesvol mijn bachelor werktuigbouwkunde met specialisatie industrieel ontwerpen amp produceren te hebben afgerond en daarnaast veel praktijkervaring te hebben opgedaan wilde ik met mijn master integrated product design mij o a meer toespitsen op producten voor mensen met mijn technische kennis hoop ik een goed doordacht product voor de ghanezen te ontwerpen
2418607 oooh yes they are rich they have a loooot of money more than you and i have

2418610 she begins with whatever vision she has just had but youve come to me for a different purpose hope
2418611 why dont you start with who you once were before the world changed
2418612 i felt so frightened yet so alive i didnt feel so alone i cant recall why i was so scared though everythings so jumbled in my head right now
2418613 oh i suppose i just never met the right person
2418614 besides im an artist and a noble who needs marriage
2418615 many times princess though ive never known the sort of love youre referring to the kind that lasts an eternity youve been fortunate o have known such a love at such a young age
2418616 do you think skion will be able to convince my father to let us marry
2418617 my mother ionia she must have been hetsian the way my father refers to hesi the fact that he became king of that country the day i was born
2418618 we are not to speak of such things it is forbidden
2418619 it is not up to me to tell you about such things im sorry princess but i really cannot talk about this
2418620 i understand a little at least my father is a monster
2418621 your father is the only one who stands in the way of king daric talking over the world
2418622 if i thought for a moment you werent helping my father hide the truth from me perhaps i would be more honest with you
2418623 please teylana just tell me something of the dream anything
2418624 there were green eyes watching me no invading my mind
2418625 she has begun stepping into peoples dreams i remember the green eyes well though i only saw them for a few months 16 years ago
2418626 i dont want the dreams to drive you mad shes not trying to hurt anyone shes watching over us in a way
2418627 i cannot give you the answers you want to hear its too dangerous and youre too important to our cause do not repeat any of what ive told you one day i hope i may tell you everything i pray to the gods that it will be me to tell you right now i cannot for your safety and for mine i do however want to guide you to teach you
2418628 yes but this i fear is more important than all of those years accept the dreams youll feel nauseous faint disoriented and you may experience severe headaches and drowsiness as you learn to open the link with her you must keep at it you must surrender to her will and you must tell no one these powers that are at work are hetsian you know how dangerous anything hetsian is here in sakara
2418629 and please stop asking lady ionia questions her position is far less stable than mine
2418630 thank you for telling me what you could about this
2418631 that is the greatest gift youve ever given me and i will try to pay attention to the two pairs of eyes
2418632 one set is emerald green the other more of a jade green
2418633 vin youre scaring me ive never seen this look on your face before
2418634 i dont have an answer forget what ive told you you cant give into the dreams like ive told you if someone else is there i cannot be sure of who else is trying to get in
2418635 there appear to be other forces at work here which i am not aware of
2418636 perhaps but i havent seen proof of his trust yet
2418637 its been a long time since ive seen you your letter said that you had a proposition for me i figured i should at least listen to it since we were once best friends
2418638 no i really havent worked at all im just living off all the money ive made in the past i dont see anything wrong with that i could live like this for the rest of my life
2418639 any family yet i would assume that i would be invited to a wedding but you never know
2418640 no and of course you would be invited im happy being independent
2418641 i know its fairly bold of me to say it but i had my suspicions before i contacted you and i knew the moment you walked through that door you need something to concentrate your efforts on
2418642 who is this patient that you have picked out for me then
2418643 she is delusional has no idea what reality is and isnt she is a bit younger than us shes been here since she was a teenager the previous management wasnt very kind to her at all i dont think she belongs here but she cannot live on her own yet shes a big fan of yours shes read all of your books several times
2418644 why me i specialize in dream analysis and sleeping disorders
2418645 you write so beautifully though i think you are wrong
2418646 i dont think you should write off all dreams as being symbolic
2418647 take all the time you need to decide nora this is entirely up to you celeste has already agreed
2418648 shell stay a few days or however long you need
2418649 celeste you dont have to do this i know ive been pressuring you stay a few days then make your decision
2418650 and i dont mind it theres something extraordinary about this woman if shes ready to leave now then i dont see any reason to stay like you said shes been here since she was a teenager what is that twenty years or so you said she doesnt belong here so whats stopping you from letting her enter into a new life
2418651 i dont know if i can make it two hours without eating can we stop on the way its been so long since ive ate out
2418652 of course i know a great cafe about halfway there if you can wait that long
2418653 he said that you were delusional that you are lost in a dream world
2418654 he used to dress like waldo from the wheres waldo books
2418655 did you know that this whole area is on top of an ancient city all the way from here to sorca was once the city gulen where the evil king daric tried to exterminate half the population many died and many the ones with the resources moved to the other side of the country to mraen he was taken down by the evil king of saqqara though king nephos as he liked to be called wasnt nearly as evil as daric
2418656 they have a different version of events they dont think that the ancient peoples even had technology they dont realize that the metal city of gulen was melted down for weaponry during the great war you have to talk to the natives around here to find out the real story
2418657 zydea was king darics granddaughter who joined king nephos and took over the world
2418658 i thought you said this was two thousand years ago
2418659 riding in cars still makes me sleepy im going to rest my eyes for a bit could you wake me when we get there
2418660 we dont know if were born more often than every two thousand years but thats all we can remember
2418661 the warriors who are reborn to fight the great war
2418662 tell me more about this past life tell me more about queen metis
2418663 metis was the most powerful of all of us i dont think anyone even saw the extent of her powers unfortunately for her zydea had several really powerful people on her side it was an even match really thats why no one won the war thats why we have to be reborn to try again im hoping though that this time the orchid queen will come out and show the full extent of her power we always thought she was the most powerful but she never thought so herself metis always said to just give her time well time is what she got
2418664 if you want to i can show you my file later dr swanson thought it would be good if you had them ive been talking about the orchid queen since i was fourteen before you ever published a book shes a legend around here not a construct of your mind
2418665 hes let me have it since he became head of the institution he thinks its good for me
2418666 yes i am we both moved to this area about the same time he was getting married and opened his own practice both of which failed miserably i was making money off of my first book we wanted to live somewhat close though we rarely see each other anymore
2418667 i was kind of like an assistant you were always afraid of me getting hurt so i rarely fought in battles though i did in the important ones
2418668 i told you that you were wrong in interpreting your dreams celeste
2418669 you are the orchid queen of course that wasnt your name it was more like a title
2418670 so in my last book which youve obviously read when i interpreted my own dreams i was really just recalling a past life
2418671 tonight is a local celebration my husband and i decided to stay open awhile before going to it its the biggest holiday among my people
2418672 it is called obidikwaya in our native tongue it is the celebration of a mythical event where my people were freed from an oppressive man called huve i believe the saviors name translates to queen of orchids if you two would like to come we welcome outsiders
2418673 i told you that this entire area was once the city gulen
2418674 huve was one of king darics generals who helped in his assassination
2418675 i suppose because mnemosyne was the greek goddess of memory
2418676 i was named after her its all coming back to you celeste you have to remember me we were raised together
2418677 youre not happy in your life dr swanson told me youre all alone and have lost all interest in your occupation just go with it for awhile let go all of this information is within you youve just proved that
2418678 were done here if the offer still stands we would like to go to the ceremony
2418679 celeste why do you want to go to the ceremony now
2418680 an hour with you and im spouting out nick names so a ceremony commemorating my victory might be worth it
2418681 i cant make out the words though i came because the trees were calling out my name
2418682 the words of the snow will make sense to you one day
2418683 many cities of the ancient world were named alexandria after alexander the great
2418684 i think my mother named me after someone from a soap opera
2418685 how would you like to be able to see everything from both perspectives
2418686 everyone has this capability but no one thinks they do
2418687 im moving into the house next door my name is gabe
2418688 i took a job last august teaching drama at the high school around here
2418689 i got tired of driving from my condo downtown so i decided to buy a cheap house nearby
2418690 alex lindy beloved friend of nefertiti born 1975 died 2004 she liked to combine things
2418691 if you wait for me ill come back in two days and take you home
2418692 you should stay and warm up a minute sorry for hitting you but i couldnt get you to wake up
2418693 this is the first time or at least i think so
2418694 a friend of mine i call him the prophet but his name is alvin
2418695 hes just this homeless guy who draws pictures of people he doesnt ask for any money for his drawings but he usually gets some anyway i never have to search for him whenever i want to find him i run into him somewhere in my dream he was sick maybe even dying he looked as if he were ninety years old instead of fifty i was following him trying to help him
2418696 ive always thought he looked like an aged jimi hendrix
2418697 i was unpacking i only have a few weeks until second semester starts and i still need to sell my condo actually i havent decided if im selling it at all
2418698 i used to paint i still do sketches as a hobby but i never try to sell anything theyre all precious to me my drawings and paintings i just tell people im a painter to answer that dreadful question of what i do for a living
2418699 oh i didnt mean that im the great american novelist or poet or anything
2418700 its more like a journal i keep i just write my random thoughts down
2418701 ginger is a warming herb its good for circulation and for general well being in ancient times they used ginger when they wanted to commune with the sun
2418702 okay i think that every aspect of nature has a voice
2418703 they speak to everyone but one must become wise and in tune with their own inner voice in order to hear them everything speaks the planetary bodies the trees the water the rocks and so on
2418704 i cant always make out what they say sometimes i think im interpreting them wrong when im ambidextrous im sure ill understand them better
2418705 ive been trying to be ambidextrous for a few years so i write some random thing down every day with my left hand
2418706 i believe that once you become ambidextrous you become wiser
2418707 there could be a lot of advantages to being ambidextrous
2418708 as a painter you could have two different styles then one day you would combine the styles and paint one of the most famous pieces of art in the entire world well it would be famous after youre dead of course and someone would find your tombstone inscription in your house and put it on your tombstone for you
2418709 maybe instead of being left brained or right brained i would be both i would be able to see things from any perspective
2418710 and earlier today you acted like you dont even like to be around people
2418711 my mother is a roman goddess not like diana or venus but in the way that the roman emperors made themselves into deities shes like livia the wife of augustus caesar maybe ill start calling her that im glad shes gone living her dream life in italy i dont have to put up with her that way
2418712 is it almost morning it looks like its getting brighter outside
2418713 we could have it at your place so nefertiti can eat with us
2418714 ill go take a bath and you can just come on over
2418715 just kidding i actually think that you are some sort of psychic whether you are or not its fun for me to think that
2418716 i hear living things rocks water and wind i think that earth is one giant living organism and everything within it has its own voice and its own part to play i dont just think this about earth but the whole universe the moon and sun are entities just like jupiter and neptune i can hear them speak why shouldnt you think im crazy
2418717 you really dont think anyone else could understand your unique perspective
2418718 i have this thing with my beard for some reason i think that a beard is only good for three months then i go three months without a beard before i grow one again its like agriculture after a few years of planting one thing you have to plant another crop to let the soil reclaim its nutrients my skin needs a few months to reclaim its nutrients before i can grow another beard i think im going to shave today its about that time
2418719 you know i think alvin was speaking to you in your dream
2418720 i like to help people alvin thought that if you were gonna sleep walk then my house was the place to go to he knew that i wouldnt think you were crazy
2418721 theyre all full of coal ive been collecting them since i moved in here
2418722 no though ive often thought that the coal fueled my insanity
2418723 you should get home and either sleep or finish unpacking your house
2418724 ive enjoyed your company but im used to spending most of my time alone im sure well be seeing a lot of each other you live in the only house next to mine
2418725 nefertiti do you think that once you go so far with something that theres no turning back
2418726 empress zydea said the purges would stop two years ago i wonder what happened to that plan
2418727 i havent slept in a long time perhaps ill rest here this alley seems safe enough
2418728 like i said i was looking for someone i assume he already left dia or at least i hope so
2418729 it will be safer for the both of us if we travel alone
2418730 yes but after they cover that block they will return
2418731 like i said you should go before its too late
2418732 okay you can come with me but only if you stick close i cannot guarantee your safety if you wander off
2418733 as you said i shouldnt leave everything to hope including your safety
2418734 they have their spotlights on we are in darkness they cannot see us
2418735 it has been set up so you can just turn on the faucets despite the lack of public works now
2418736 though im really not that important i suppose that is a good question to ask
2418737 now im running from the sakaran police because i was dumb enough to come back to dia
2418738 but now i dont see any real purpose ahead of me except for survival
2418739 but not real people i painted people from my dreams people that couldnt exist in real life
2418740 they had strange colored skin eyes and hair and those were the normal ones some had even stranger features
2418741 how is that so different than the way people are now
2418742 perhaps your purpose is to find the ones you painted
2418743 the purges are to rid the world of the weak while they are doing this they are also looking for certain people these people are the ones who will rise up against the empress
2418744 these people have certain capabilities that she has herself as well as those who work with her these people have mutated more than just physically these people know more than the general population does she has to find them and take them alive she needs information from them more than that she will try to convince them to work for her
2418745 when you painted these people who couldnt really exist were there any that had names
2418746 that is how i knew your name we all named ourselves at some point in time either that or our parents renamed us according to our abilities belit was a god of the arts in an ancient fean religion i know its difficult to understand it was hard for me until i remembered the past
2418747 i cant even remember what my real name was whats the past got to do with the fact that i painted the future
2418748 and now we have been reborn you painting those people was your sub conscious mind telling you what we once looked like
2418749 but yes it happens every two thousand years and we have lived through it before after the great change it takes many generations for life to evolve back to the way it once was since societies collapse every time it occurs there are no records of the great change or of us for that matter
2418750 so youre saying that we lived two thousand years ago
2418751 this will be our fifth lifetime and i assume the reason you returned to dia is that you were searching for the keeper of shadows just as i was he is one of our leaders one of the most powerful of our kind
2418752 that is who i was but i am now grown i was reborn closer to the time of the others rather than many years later
2418753 we assume that it meant the wars would end when i was grown
2418754 my mother made this prophecy after i was killed during our first life im not sure what else she could have referred to and really no one was left alive to claim victory in the last four wars with zydea if hopes prophecy was right then this will be the last one this will either be zydeas defeat or victory
2418755 since im certain that the keeper of shadows has left dia we should look for someone else the only other information i have is on the orchid queen i believe that she is somewhere on the southern part of fea it would be a long journey but its the only other lead i have
2418756 queen metis gave her the title the orchid queen when oneira was just an infant nobody has figured out what the title means
2418757 they knew what my power was when i was born you always watched over me when my guardians were on important missions
2418758 we have not seen her since the end of the first war
2418759 but i have a feeling that she has been around watching over me dont worry belit you will remember more each day
2418760 we must not let them see our faces they may recognize us
2418761 the sakaran police could be anywhere james do you remember me im pindar we had an art history class together you helped me out
2418762 so much was lost from our memories when the apocalypse happened
2418763 oh well perhaps i was confusing my memory of you with another name
2418764 my name is belit and you should keep your voice down
2418765 were not far from the city gates we can make it to the woods and then well be safe
2418766 as foolish as he was he just gave his life for yours
2418767 yes your life is worth more than many men you are a necessary piece in the weapon that will destroy zydea
2418768 we will find a boat on one of the many rivers of sakara
2418769 they all flow into the ocean on either the east or west side of this continent
2418770 will we be running for the rest of our lives
2418771 come let us begin our journey until we find the others we are vulnerable im afraid we are two of the lesser powers we must find the powerful ones our leaders we must find the keeper of shadows or the orchid queen that is why we must get to fea though she may be gone by then
2418772 why would someone with everything be so unhappy to take drugs
2418773 these shadowy figures are about to plunge their canoe into what is arguably the finest rowing venue in the world the 32 000 square metre shunyi rowing park built specially for the games with room for 37 000 spectators
2418774 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document amp 183 as outlined in mr suskinds book
2418775 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2418776 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2418777 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2418778 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2418779 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2418780 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2418781 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2418782 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2418783 discovering new bands amp their music along with keeping the release affordable is what we wished to produce and i think we have done quite a nice job bringing together some very diverse bands into one affordable compilation
2418784 the most important development of the entire campaign this week
2418785 he was there a month ago in this community and was asked a question about this dhl issue and did not say one word about his role in this or the role of his campaign manager that is the furthest thing from straight talk that we can imagine
2418786 john mccain can become an emblem for people about what is wrong with washington he released an ad this week about how washington is broken and how he will strive to fix it he didnt mention that he has been enmeshed in a broken washington culture for 26 years or that his campaign is run by the most powerful now former lobbyist in washington
2418787 foreign owned dhl buy a u s company and gain control over the jobs that are now on the chopping block in ohio
2418788 well what a first day you get a ton of work and that woman comes in screaming

2418790 zijn vader andr zag zijn talent al hij zit nu trots te zijn op een wolk
2418791 once i asked him again when he was going to get his hair cut i lost the bet

2418797 harlot i now see what your game is you and that accursed collection of meat are in cahoots you are trying to tempt me much how eve convinced adam the apple was delicious
2418798 actually the bible never stated what kind of fruit it was it couldve been anything personally i think it mayve been a grapefruit
2418799 oh yeah grapefruits are nothing but trouble hey dont try to change the subject you handmaiden of the devilish deli dish
2418800 well if thats how you feel you can sleep on the couch

2418802 dave we live in philadelphia we dont have circle ks here youre thinking of bill amp teds excellent adventure again the convenience stores here are wawas
2418803 inside you theres an artist you dont know about say yes quickly if you know if youve known it from before the beginning of the universe
2418804 mans mind once stretched by a new idea never regains its original dimensions
2418805 the one important thing i have learned over the years is the difference between taking ones work seriously and taking ones self seriously the first is imperative the second is disastrous
2418806 altar hangings and clerical vestments and smaller more light hearted pieces for secular spaces
2418807 now you can see why my friends all say that
2418808 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover
2418809 perseverance is a great element of success if you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate you are sure to wake up somebody
2418810 no pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars or sailed an uncharted land or opened a new doorway for the human spirit
2418811 when a man is sufficiently motivated discipline will take care of itself
2418812 the greatest good you can do for another is not just to share your riches but to reveal to him his own
2418813 forgiveness is the economy of the heart forgiveness saves the expense of anger the cost of hatred the waste of spirits
2418814 the senior police officer came in and asked who is the english guy here and i put my hand up and he said you are free you are out of here and everyone jumped up and cheered and started to clap
2418815 there were 22 in the cell yesterday and we were jam packed but they split us up one half in one cell and one half in the other
2418816 they said i wasnt supposed to be with real criminals but the majority of people there were hardened criminals who happened to be in for child maintenance
2418817 maintenance standards have deteriorated at united as operational decisions are increasingly driven by economic considerations
2418818 stop the egregious management decisions which have caused events such as four engine failures in two weeks
2418819 engine performance and maintenance requirements exceed all federal safety standards
2418820 all of this engine maintenance is performed by our dedicated and highly competent employees in san francisco and is held to our own very high safety standards and those of the faa
2418821 to make decisions based on economics often times at the expense of safety and regulatory compliance
2418822 it is unconscionable and intentionally misleading for alpa to suggest otherwise
2418823 i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
2418824 i wanted her not to tell the public what had happened very simple thats the reason i went
2418825 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2418826 yes there it is the most amazing thing ive ever seen
2418827 if its saggy baggy or draggin i want it nipped tucked or sucked
2418828 god is in his heaven all is right with the world
2418829 we use the words womyn wimmin women and womben interchangably we really dont care how its spelled though the fact that many people get upset about unconventional spellings of this word might be a reason to do just that
2418830 the mental act of 1 putting into meaningful order 2 what one has already known in order to 3 attain what one is still ignorant of
2418831 maha suci allah yang memperjalankan hamba nya pada suatu malam dari masjidil haram ke masjidil aqsa yang kami berkati sekelilingnya supaya kami perlihatkan kepadanya sebahagian daripada tanda kebesaran kami sesungguhnya dia adalah maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
2418832 aku menangis kerana orang muda yang diutuskan selepasku tetapi umatnya masuk syurga lebih ramai daripada umatku
2418833 rasulullah saw menceritakan kepada kaumnya apa yang diperlihatkan allah kepadanya mendengar cerita itu mereka bertambah tidak percaya dan semakin menyakitinya
2418834 sesungguhnya allah menggunakan pendekatan ini surah al israk untuk memberi kefahaman bahawa peristiwa israk berlaku di baitul maqdis kerana orang yahudi akan disingkirkan daripada memimpin umat manusia
2418835 dan sungguh akan kami berikan cubaan kepadamu dengan sedikit ketakutan kelaparan kekurangan harta jiwa dan tanam tanaman dan berikanlah berita gembira kepada orang orang yang sabar
2418836 sesungguhnya allah menyuruh kamu supaya menyerahkan segala jenis amanah kepada ahlinya yang berhak menerimanya dan apabila kamu menjalankan hukum diantara manusia allah menyuruh kamu menghukum dengan adil sesungguhnya allah dengan suruhannya itu memberi pengajaran yang sebaik baiknya kepada kamu sesungguhnya allah sentiasa mendengar lagi sentiasa melihat
2418837 too many ministries have become big business that message is desecrating the church today
2418838 i will refine them like silver and test them like gold
2418839 for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed
2418840 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable
2418841 my soul take thine ease eat drink and be merry
2418842 i saw sheik gumi on the television nta nigeria television authority during that period preaching this inciting sermon in fact the same sermon was again broadcast by nta kaduna on september 21 and 22
2418843 he specifically called for a jihad and that when they go killing they should not kill the elderly people because the elderly have spent their years already but that muslims should kill young christians
2418844 should fight to take over nigeria by going to war against christians
2418845 with these kinds of statements coming from muslim leaders why would the followers of islam not attack christians
2418846 we believe that the killing of henry ogbaje and basil are the result of such sermons of these muslim leaders
2418847 she said they attacked him around the hours of five and six in the evening in the gamji gate area where they left him unconscious believing they had killed him
2418848 henry was left in that state for about three hours with no one helping him
2418849 i am guessing that none of these people started off with the goal of having this be their story if you were someone in my stage of ministry what would you do to prevent this from being my lot
2418850 but if a man does not know how to manage his own household how will he take care of the church of god
2418851 i do not hide myself behind an internet line i am material and my data am examined
2418852 our tag line was the christmas story according to matthew mark luke john paul george and ringo and our overall theme was we want to start a revolution weve done u2 music and featured bono sharing about his christian faith and weve used madonnas material world in a series featuring 80s music
2418853 heres the bottom line the christian message never changes but methods must
2418854 studies show spiritual hunger in the u s at an all time high but church attendance at an all time low and dropping a lot of people feel church is irrelevant so its time to change church cant meet peoples needs if people wont come in the front door
2418855 they listen to songs watch movies have discussions with friends and try to make sense of the world if you listen youll hear spiritual issues under discussion in music in movies on tv and among people so my contention is that churches should jump in on these conversations already happening in a context people understand
2418856 songs and movies are talking about spiritual issues in ways that people really do understand but too often in churches weve talked about things people dont get language is a big thing church people have the curse of knowledge we are talking about things no one understands we are answering questions no one is asking the church has lived in a bubble to a certain extent and no one is sticking around that hasnt been in church forever we need to leverage culture to connect to people
2418857 wed been looking for a way to present the topic of sex in the church because its definitely something people talk about every day the church ought to have something to say about it so we decided to enter the conversation after all sex is gods idea and is very good in a committed relationship
2418858 we started off our campaign with attention getting billboards because if we had said sex talk at such and such church it would be an immediate turnoff everyone wouldve thought they already knew what the church would say so we looked for a creative way to connect with people
2418859 church cant meet peoples needs if people wont come in the front door
2418860 the chief agents in the expansion of christianity appear not to have been those who made it a profession or a major part of their occupation but men and women who earned their livelihood in some purely secular manner and spoke of their faith to those whom they met in this natural fashion
2418861 im having a difficult time connecting your professed love for luther to binge eating at the v f w
2418862 well for goodness sake dont you think it would be in your best interest to tell luther
2418863 in freezing temperatures he flies and crashes a plane naked speaks deliriously and exhibits belligerent tendencies you tell me helga
2418864 im surprised to see you out at this time of night
2418865 okay okay i did it there are you happy you crazy old man
2418866 i think youre a good person who made a bad choice
2418867 i told you something like this was going to happen
2418868 i told you this idea of dumping suds into the old abandoned mine was a bad one
2418869 the phone has been ringing off the hook with reports of bubbles in the water lines this is a soap factory how else could the water become contaminated with bubbles theres not another business in the area that could have produced this kind of terrible situation
2418870 i agree lets crawl in the back of the van and wait out the night
2418871 im not worried about that right now instead i feel like im going to be sick
2418872 tell me what happened today gloria why did you go on a binge
2418873 actually my work is commissioned in two galleries one in minneapolis the other in chicago
2418874 listen i didnt bring you here for this i want to show you something else something very special
2418875 ill meet you back here in an hour well go have dinner afterwards dance
2418876 youve already proven your guilt when it comes to pipes
2418877 if you could destroy church pipes certainly you could vandalize the towns water system
2418878 im telling you i didnt have anything to do with soap in the water lines sounds like youre trying to find a sacrificial goat to take the heat for this
2418879 i dont mean to disturb you at this time of night
2418880 earle has escaped he managed to sneak past hospital personnel said earles unstable a danger to himself
2418881 all i want is to get through the end of the year hell ive been at this plant nearly thirty years and in all that time weve never had to resort to the tactics you two are proposing
2418882 damn mayor wont give us the permit for the additional bubble holding tanks if we want to proceed with expanding production theres only one course of action
2418883 but draining soap sludge into the abandoned mine isnt the answer im telling you
2418884 we can hire a truck to haul the sludge as we originally discussed
2418885 for appearance sake only a truck will come twice a week at a very visible time to get a token load of bubble sludge other than that soap residue will be piped directly into a fissure in the old mine
2418886 they kept me locked up against my will in that miserable hospital sophia stepped forward
2418887 its one thing to be hospitalized with a head injury from the crash its another to be kept because of nakedness
2418888 i get flare ups where my skin is hypersensitive at those times its difficult to wear clothes i was having a flare up when i was flying the plane all the rescue people including dr fango misinterpreted my nakedness now here i am trying to find my plane so i can get my clothes
2418889 im sure he has suspected for several days that my mission of rewiring the church is nearly completed by this time next week ill be done
2418890 news around town is the soap factory will be remodeling and im sure theyll need a good electrician sophia glanced nonchalantly out the window though deep down she burned with powerful emotion
2418891 flipping out at the v f w s annual pancake feed
2418892 the naked pilot had luthers picture not only does he claim that luther is his father but he looks like him as well
2418893 arranging for jack hermosa tyler to stay at sophia jonsons place is one of the most foolish things youve done
2418894 jack hermosa tyler intends to stay long enough to rewire the church unless he finds a reason to stay
2418895 i think you arranged for him to be with sophia because secretly youre hoping theyll get together
2418896 jack hermosa tyler is staying at sophias guest cottage because theres nowhere more appropriate for him in the area the alternative would be brightan motel which is out of the question you want him to stay at brightan motel denise
2418897 you need to set angelina sparks straight otherwise when the time comes youd better be prepared to help mend her broken heart
2418898 just received a report of a plane crash north of the landfill
2418899 heck of a way to spend our afternoon eh willis
2418900 we did find a picture but its not of the pilot
2418901 id say this picture was taken about twenty years ago
2418902 i thought he couldnt come for at least another month
2418903 apparently the good lord has provided a way and id say timing is perfect given the trouble weve been having with the wiring
2418904 no actually everything is not okay jack thats why im here
2418905 hes messed up in something bad luther luther nearly choked
2418906 he was sitting there arguing on his cell phone i was cleaning the table right behind him and i was shocked to hear what he said
2418907 now why would the mayor say he wasnt going to be threatened luther wrote the words
2418908 is between us our secret if he could have spoken luther might have sworn shaking his head rolling his eyes he departed the grubby cauldron feeling soiled
2418909 that means keeping the church locked when people arent here
2418910 considering what weve experienced today with the flooding its probably not good to leave the church unlocked when unattended
2418911 if we lock up our church we give up the very essence of who we are as a body of believers thats not what dalton springs christian church is about rather we must remain open and welcoming
2418912 i guess well all have to be more diligent in watching the church
2418913 i appreciate the invitation for dinner but i dont think it would be fair to you if i accepted
2418914 im going home to minneapolis after i finish with the church
2418915 i came down to let you know the lights are out in the office
2418916 i should have told you the power to that part of the church would be off this afternoon
2418917 we got a bit of a problem luther and im hoping you can help us
2418918 you probably heard the news about the plane crash near the landfill earlier today
2418919 well a small plane crashed a couple hours ago weve been trying to identify the pilot but he has no identification or paperwork other than an old picture of you
2418920 the pilot survived the crash but hes injured from the markings of the plane we learned the craft is registered to a business in minneapolis were still working on that but in the meantime it might be helpful if you would come with me to the hospital to see if you recognize this fellow
2418921 hey i see you are really into social media and as a business person im interested in learning all that i can do you mind if i follow you
2418922 my business is in a building owned by a family member but let me tell you a bit more about what my business does
2418923 hey theres a new way to reach out and touch someone
2418924 and he has made all nations of men of one blood to dwell on all the face of the earth ordaining fore appointed seasons and boundaries of their dwelling to seek the lord if perhaps they might feel after him and find him though indeed he is not far from each one of us
2418925 where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth
2418926 the heavens declare the glory of god and the expanse proclaims his handiwork day to day pours forth speech and night to night reveals knowledge there is no speech nor are there words their voice is not heard
2418927 but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands

2418931 theyll have to see the wbc tattoo on our butts
2418932 always play play play better dont come back with fails
2418933 i am not a child killer i was a step parent back then and we were a family on our feet doing well and when this happened it just blows your world away and to see it go on for 15 years and to see what has gone on for the past year and a half has been devastating and highly wrong
2418934 i havent done a thing wrong and everybody knows that
2418935 to look at the people that done me like that cause i imagine they are all going to be sitting there i would like to just walk in and look at them
2418936 part of it is in the hands of a publisher or a book writer not a publisher a writer i think we are going to write a pretty good story about this
2418937 es una definici n que nos tienen que dar las autoridades laborales y nosotros salvaguardando ese respeto que hemos expresado desde el principio de la vida interna del sindicato no expresaremos ninguna opini n hasta que no sea la autoridad laboral que nos indique cu les y en qu dimensiones la realidad de cada una de las organizaciones sind cales que existen en el estado
2418938 los directivos y maestros de nuestras escuelas son los l deres de sus comunidades educativas y nosotros insistiremos en hacer un llamado para que todos reconozcan que es una responsabilidad que tenemos no con un l der sindical sino con el gobierno y la sociedad de baja california con nuestros ni os y j venes
2418939 yo creo que vivimos en un pa s de instituciones en donde hay los causes legales para quejarnos proponer y expresar nuestras ideas
2418940 my new soap has sparkles in it i must have picked up something really trendy or something meant for a 13 year old girl

2418954 great read every day makes me smile as rab muses about music and his irreverant views on the eu tune in you wont be disappointed
2418955 excellent blog which can be controversial at times while maintaining its humour keep it up big rab
2418956 updated every day with doses of good humour political satire a running commentary on the progress of authors home football team and his life
2418957 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
2418958 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
2418959 that good is the enemy of great is not just a business problem it is a human problem
2418960 level 5 leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company its not that level 5 leaders have no ego or self interest indeed they are incredibly ambitious
2418961 the right people will do the right things and deliver the best results theyre capable of regardless of the incentive system
2418962 you absolutely cannot make a series of good decisions without first confronting the brutal facts
2418963 if you successfully implement the findings of this book you will not need to spend time and energy motivating people if you have the right people on the bus they will be self motivated
2418964 leading from good to great does not mean coming up with the answers and then motivating everyone to follow your messianic vision it means having the humility to grasp the fact that you do not yet understand enough to have the answers and then to ask the questions that will lead to the best possible insights
2418965 this is a very important lesson you must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end which you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be
2418966 what separates people is not the presence or absence of difficulty but how they deal with the inevitable difficulties of life
2418967 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing
2418968 the purpose of bureaucracy is to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline a problem that largely goes away if you have the right people in the first place avoid bureaucracy and hierarchy and instead create a culture of discipline
2418969 build a consistent system with clear constraints but also give people freedom and responsibility within the framework of that system hire self disciplined people who dont need to be managed then manage the system not the people
2418970 much of the answer to the question of good to great lies in the discipline to do whatever it takes to become the best within carefully selected arenas and then to seek continual improvement from there its really just that simple and its really just that difficult
2418971 indeed a great company is much more likely to die of indigestion from too much opportunity than starvation from too little the challenge becomes not opportunity creation but opportunity selection
2418972 mediocrity results first and foremost from management failure not technological failure
2418973 no technology can instill the simple inner belief that leaving unrealized potential on the table letting something remain good when it can become great is a secular sin
2418974 heres whats important weve allowed the way transitions look from the outside to drive our perception of what they must feel like to those going through them on the inside from the outside they look like dramatic almost revolutionary breakthroughs but from the inside they feel completely different more like an organic development process
2418975 the good to great companies understood a simple truth tremendous power exists in the fact of continued improvement and the delivery of results point to tangible accomplishments however incremental at first and show how these steps fit into the context of an overall concept that will work when you do this in such a way that people see and feel the buildup of momentum they will line up with enthusiasm
2418976 two big mediocrities joined together never make one great company
2418977 like most overnight successes it was about twenty years in the making
2418978 i believe it is no harder to build something great than to build something good
2418979 the search for meaning or more precisely the search for meaningful work
2418980 in a sense much of this book is about creating a culture of discipline it all starts with disciplined people
2418981 greatness is not a function of circumstance greatness it turns out is largely a matter of conscious choice
2418982 if we only have great companies we will merely have a prosperous society not a great one economic growth and power are the means not the definition of a great nation

2418992 its not about race its about the gah dayem culture
2418993 weve always fought americas wars thats the scots irish culture it goes all the way back to before william wallace its why hadrian built the bleepin hadrians wall
2418994 but he never said he didnt fix up no cars for some boys who did
2418995 if obama wants to win the bubba vote he can do it
2418996 he can win virginia easy hes just got to show up and be himself
2418997 id have him come down here to a diner no tie and get him to say exactly this im barack obama and im a black guy and theres not a damn thing i can do about that
2418998 the only one i know who could was michael jackson and im not going through that
2418999 it burns my ass every time i come here the democrats dont come here because they think they cant win the republicans dont come here because they figure theyre good on guns and theyre good on god and so theyve got it all wrapped up all i want is for both sides to be fighting over these voters so someone will pay attention to whats going on here and in rural places all across america
2419000 the greatest realignment in modern politics would take place rather quickly if the right national leader found a way to bring the scots irish and african americans to the same table and so to redefine a formula that has consciously set them apart for the past two centuries
2419001 warners worse than a black guy a yankee from connecticut i mean really in
2419002 what obama has to do is talk about the commonalities and say who he is its the damndest thing ive ever seen the national media is shh hes black shh somebodys gonna find out
2419003 let me tell you something dont run from your culture embrace it obama needs to bring matt guitar murphy down here he breaks into come on baby dont you want to go to that same old place and get him to sing sweet home chicago you talk about people going nuts thats pronounced nu uts my people love black culture look what i had for breakfast biscuits and gravy thats black food the banjo is an african instrument go to the beach and tell me what kind of music do you hear
2419004 people dont vote on issues they vote for the guy they like
2419005 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2419006 obama said he wasnt talking about race but i dont think he was talking about his ears
2419007 race is always a factor but i knew in my race if race became the issue then id lost
2419008 foster an unconscious simile obama as a blinged up camera hungry nba shooting guard allen iverson with a harvard law degree
2419009 every now and then we ought to have a frank discussion about race how can we have a frank discussion if people are afraid to even mention the word maybe weve gone to a new threshold
2419010 the last prominent unabashed white racist politician in this country
2419011 for a democrat to win in north carolina he or she needs to get 40 percent of the white vote assuming a solid 90 percent of the black vote lets say obama can push the black percentage of voters to 25 percent and that would be a lot hed knock down the white threshold to 37 38 percent the margin of error is very small
2419012 but those people who say that racism is forever and that things havent changed for the better in the south are just wrong whether its a restaurant like this with a little confederate memorial but a whole bunch of black folk having breakfast with a whole lot of white folk and and lot of them at mixed tables this society has changed
2419013 i think its a longshot i think virginia is a little further along than north carolina i told my students that north carolina is teetering on the edge of being a swing state
2419014 they always say he was unwavering in his beliefs they just dont say what those beliefs were
2419015 and most of them wouldnt be here except for jesse helms he made this state a two party state and whatever else anyone says about him were a better state because of that
2419016 you were the best qualified but they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota
2419017 wont play the role it has historically played here theyve coined this term post racial i really think people see obama that way somehow that gives us the opportunity to debate the real issues as the first priority not as the second priority the first priority was always jumping over the race barrier and then we get to the issue i think hes sort of leaped over that
2419018 where everyplace else in the south they had two of everything we had
2419019 this is how it would operate bathrooms would be marked white colored indian other
2419020 four of each no wait it was eight of each four for women and four for men
2419021 so when im telling you that racial attitudes have changed in north carolina im not telling you from reading the stuff i lived it
2419022 i think theres an overwhelming desire to move beyond the racial divide im absolutely convinced of that i know people dont want to be hung up on the same kinds of things that have shackled the south the same issue that serves as the leg irons and the handcuffs that shackled this region for a century i think theres an overwhelming sentiment to move on to the next chapter a chapter not defined by race
2419023 im not a racist but i dont want a black man for president i shouldnt say a black man but i dont want to vote for him i dont think hes capable of running the country you know i get most of my information on the internet from my republican buddies i belong to a union so im supposed to vote democrat but im not going to vote for obama is it race i just dont think hes smart enough to run the country
2419024 southeastern ohio which is usually a republican area was very influential in getting democrats elected in 2006
2419025 hes the one talking about hope and this town needs some hope but i dont know i think virginia has a better chance of going for obama than ohio
2419026 the funny thing is that people who walk in here and say this stuff a lot of them are educated people
2419027 id say i just cant believe it and theyll be adamant you ask for proof and they say they read it on the internet
2419028 he asked me whether i wanted to walk down to the hardware store
2419029 i just worry about his experience i dont know i may not even vote
2419030 i dont think we need another four years like the last eight years
2419031 i can tell you that im sure thats an issue for some people but its not for anyone here
2419032 i just wish we had another chance to vote for hillary maybe when the time comes we just wont vote
2419033 i just dont think its going to matter that much there are a lot of important issues out there gas prices the war the economy
2419034 its a friendly bar in this town white people would go to one bar and black people would go to one bar my bar everyone gets along it bothered some people that everyone comes here but i said this is america right i mean its ridiculous right
2419035 there are a lot of people in this town who wouldnt vote for a black guy
2419036 i think hes intelligent i think because of the way he was brought up i think he can make a difference in the middle east where most of our problems are
2419037 its a new way of thinking all kids want to do is get to the pros do you know the odds are of a kid getting to the pros
2419038 i hate to say this but ive got to bring it up the afro americans the majority of them in this town theyre ruining everything
2419039 there are a lot of good ones good athletes good academics but they leave and they dont come back what you get are babies having babies twelve years old 13 its not just clairton and im not saying all of them but the majority of em they take from this town and they dont put nothing back
2419040 but im going to witness something here barack obama is going to be the first afro american president of the united states and thats something
2419041 he as much as said speaking of blacks we had to quit blaming whitey i hadnt heard that since martin luther king its like what bill cosby said the white man is not holding you back now youve got to go out and make a living and youve got to be a responsible person if you want to be accepted but there are people hes not reaching because the mentality is not there
2419042 youre getting a real chuckle out of me arent you
2419043 let me ask yall a personal question if you dont mind
2419044 you hear all this stuff about racism in the appalachian mountains and all the stereotypes that the yankees put on us
2419045 but that doesnt mean racism doesnt exist here does it
2419046 it was the brothers or the mothers of the confederacy
2419047 our camp has zero tolerance of racism zero our camp saved booker t washingtons memorial
2419048 you should come to a meeting call me well go together
2419049 this is just the start you watch those blacks all stick together they get osama elected and then all the presidents are going to be black
2419050 i just dont understand how people think that way i really dont
2419051 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2419052 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2419053 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2419054 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2419055 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2419056 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2419057 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2419058 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2419100 saya itu yakin bahwa pemahaman para pengikut syaikh rabi bin hadi dan syaikh muqbil bin hadi itu
2419101 metode yang mereka pakai adalah googling mencari informasi dengan search engine google ini bukan perbuatan orang muslim tetapi kaum yahudi
2419102 saya percaya apa pun kata hadis anda tentang perilaku sex muhamad tetap anda anggap muhamad itu adalah orang yang mulia dan beraklak baik itu terserah anda

2419105 eh alquran yang asli itu sudah dibakar usman cs alquran yang elo pegang itu adalah salinan ke 2 sudah banyak bukti alquran itu kitab sesat yang nyontek dari apocripa palsu dan banyak kontradiksi di dalamnya secara extenal pun alquran itu banyak bohongnya dan kisah alquran punyak bertentangan dgn sejarah dan alkitab kalau dibahas bisa panjang lebar bung
2419106 dan diantara manusia ada orang orang yang membantah tentang allah tanpa ilmu pengetahuan tanpa petunjuk dan tanpa kitab wahyu yang bercahaya dengan memalingkan lambungnya untuk menyesatkan manusia dari jalan allah ia mendapat kehinaan di dunia dan di hari kiamat kami merasakan kepadanya adzab neraka yang membakar
2419107 azab dan neraka bagi orang yang ingar dan mendustai alquran
2419108 di alkitab jelas menyatakan bahwa yesus itu adalah penyelamat dan penolong manusia masakan tuhan ente mau mengutus nabi terakhir setelah isa tapi tuh orang bukan penolong dan penyelamat manusia jika itu terjadi kemungkinan ada 2 1 tuhan ente lagi linglung 2 muhamad nabi palsu percaya ame gue deh ngak akan lari dari 2 kemungkinan itu lah
2419109 semoga anda semakin yakin bahwa alquran adalah wahyu setan yang sengaja menyesatkan manusia dari kebenaran alkitab
2419110 diantara manusia ada orang yang membantah tentang allah tanpa ilmu pengetahuan dan mengikuti setiap syaithan yang jahat yang telah ditetapkan terhadap syaithan itu bahwa barangsiapa yang berkawan dengan dia tentu dia akan menyesatkannya dan membawanya ke adzab neraka
2419111 alquran bilang isa bukan hanya utusan tapi sebagai allah god juga
2419112 tapi muhamad malah mati diracun oleh orang yahudi kemudia mati dikuburkan dan tidak bangkit dari kematian
2419113 jika minum khamar adalah perbuatan setan dan allah swt memberi minum khamar di surga islam maka jelas
2419114 tuhan islam itu bisa melakukan perbuatan setan makara atau tipu daya adalah perbuatan iblis yang juga dilakukan oleh allah swt
2419115 he he he he sudah pada frustasi tidak bisa mengelak fakta pengetahuan muhamad itu dari iblis lalu bikin pertanyaan yang bodoh dan oot
2419116 tuhannya muhammad awloh dlm quran yang begitu gila penyembahan adalah bukan tuhan yang sama dengan tuhan para nabi tuhannya muhammad adalah tuhan lain yang tidak ada hubungannya dengan para nabi justru kalau kita mencocokkannya dengan bibel tuhannya muhammad identik dengan setan
2419117 kita tahu bahwa sosok yang mula mula menyesatkan manusia adam adalah setan kemudian awloh mengaku dengan terus terang bahwa dirinya suka menyesatkan manusia dan raja tipu yang lihai
2419118 hanya tuhan sinting saja yg minta dirinya disembah sembah 50 kali sehari
2419119 saya bukan kristen kalau saya disuruh memilih nabi mana yang layak diikuti saya pilih yesus sekalipun yesus bukan tuhan dan bila seandainya allah swt itu tuhan saya lebih memilih tidak ber tuhan
2419120 saya percaya kalau semua umat beragama bisa hidup rukun bersama yaitu apabila ajaran ajarannya tidak seperti ajaran arab ajaran muhammad itu sangat berbahaya masa dia mengajari kita agar membunuh orang orang di sekeliling kita dia pun juga mencita citakan arab suatu hari nanti bakal menguasai seluruh dunia telaah kritis mana mesti kita ikuti yesus atau muhammad
2419121 kita ikut muhammad sama dengan ikut setan kita ikut yesus sama dengan ikut tuhan
2419122 tetapi muhammad mengajari kita agar memusuhi manusia lain seharusnya kita sadar kalau muhammad adalah alat setan dialah anti kristus
2419123 yesus tidak pernah mengajari kita agar memusuhi manusia lain tetapi muhammad mengajari kita agar memusuhi manusia lain seharusnya kita sadar kalau muhammad adalah alat setan dialah anti kristus
2419124 iya kok memang islam telah memfitnah tapi kalau yang berikut ini bukanlah fitnah 1

2419262 the russians have now thrown out the or forced out bp out of russia
2419263 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2419264 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia

2419270 on thinking about edupunk it strikes me that ive been drawn to a group of people that have embodied it for years people that are open that prefer to diy people who share remix mashup and generally operate in the spirit of what is now being called edupunk
2419271 edupunk refers to a scrappy diy spirit in some sectors of educational technology
2419272 edupunk is student centered resourceful teacher or community created rather than corporate sourced and underwritten by a progressive political stance edupunk it seems takes old school progressive educational tactics hands on learning that starts with the learners interests and makes them relevant to todays digital age sometimes by forgoing digital technologies entirely
2419273 am i the only one to find this edupunk meme ridiculous the adolescent ethos music etc are matched only by the adolescent narcissism anger wilful non conformity sanctimony and tirades against authority fine except this is all coming from teachers
2419274 i think you are mistaken to confuse the target of edupunk criticism as the capitalist
2419275 seeking to politicize and i would argue infantilize discussion in this space

2419307 some patients respond beautifully to one drug and not to another
2419308 although it isnt common practice in the circle we agree with your idea of making the last leg of your training an actual mission for the circle it is quite amusing that you would seek to serve a circle to which you are still an initiate it is also pleasing
2419309 you have also demonstrated the qualities of a wanderer and explorer and it is not our interest to hold you in one place against your will as you have clearly indicated that you are not interested in and i quote a silly errand we have decided to send you to ulthalamel as you know tensions are rising between the eloran nation and the dorn states to the south you are to seek out information about the situation and play whatever role you see fit in defusing any explosive circumstances you are also to advise us if you feel that conflict is to soon arise as a result of the situation and that our intervention is required

2419391 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2419392 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2419393 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2419394 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2419395 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2419396 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2419397 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2419398 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2419399 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2419400 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
2419401 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2419402 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2419412 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2419413 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2419414 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2419415 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2419416 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2419425 the research uncovered a previously unknown link between the energy machinery of the nostoc bacterium and its core nitrogen metabolism
2419426 it will certainly be some time before a pool of bacteria powers your car but this research is yet another small step towards sustainable fuels
2419427 the next step for us will be further investigation into hydrogen production as well as constructing more mathematical models capable of integrating various sources of biological data
2419428 once you know the gene thats responsible you can potentially figure out the proteins that are defective and possibly treat these patients
2419429 until you know what the defect is you cant devise any treatment once youve at least identified a defective gene you can work on potential treatments
2419430 the implications for dogs is that we have the possibility to reduce the frequency of this mutation in the population and in this way immediately avoid new cases of crd caused by this mutation
2419431 for humans the study may help in the identification of the etiology of some cases of crd and the dog could also be an extremely valuable model for the development of new treatment schemes for crd including gene therapy
2419432 in the future if they could use this model for gene therapy to see whether or not they can replace the gene product with a good protein that actually works in the retina and they can restore vision in this dachshund that would be helpful if we were to find same gene defect in humans that would be good news we could potentially use gene therapy in humans to restore vision
2419433 the cone cells are basically responsible for your very sharp central vision thats what allows you to read and see things far away and also provide you with color vision

2419439 i saw the injury when it happened and obviously everyones body responds a little bit different so his bodys response will be different from other guys but one thing that i do think and believe is that hes a pretty quick healer
2419440 i kept on a read zone right around the outside and went to turn up and just couldnt do what i normally did
2419441 i didnt go down i just did a little hop and skip and they came to check me out and put a little ice on it
2419442 ronnie did a great job thursday coming in and did a great job running the offense
2419443 i dont think well really miss anything there those guys respect him and hes got good control of the huddle and hell do a good job hell keep the offense on track
2419444 and i get reps with the starters anyway it wont be any different
2419445 its a lot of learning and stuff like that but once i get the plays down and know what im doing ill be all right
2419446 once i can learn the offense completely 100 percent then ill be fine but until then i dont want to get in there and not know what im doing

2419453 its a process with yuni hes still learning and he kind of dropped his arm and slung the ball over toward first i dont think youll see him do that again soon
2419454 if hed made the throw we could have minimized the damage to carlos
2419455 carlos threw the ball pretty well but he didnt have his good sinking fastball and without that he doesnt have his full arsenal
2419456 they dont want to hear it the night they pitch but well tell him we know what kind of competitor he is and that were sticking with him
2419457 no one works any harder between starts he and mel stottlemyre are working hard all the time it will pay off
2419458 we dropped the ball and we missed it we clearly made the mistake

2419477 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2419478 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2419479 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him

2419628 the fact that the images i took of the suicide bombing which are just photographs of something that happens every day all across the country the fact that these photos have been so incredibly shocking to people says that whatever the us military are doing to limit this type of photo getting out it is working
2419629 the pope has indicated he might apologise to victims of sexual abuse and that is a positive thing to do
2419630 but unless he follows up with some practical advice that addresses the sexual needs and desires of clergy the problem will simply continue

2419637 even today i was there in front of the tv with my wife waiting for the team to be announced i was numb when they finished reading the names he said
2419638 i dont know what badrinath has told the media but i cant discuss the outcome of the selection meeting with the press because it is confidential and not for the public
2419639 forget about the performance during the emerging players tournament even before that i scored heavily during india a series against australia and south africa and the only player to have done better than me in domestic competition was gautam gambhir
2419640 it baffled me when manoj tiwary went to australia but still i kept my cool now it is virat kohli this is really going nowhere none of the selectors have told me where i stand they should allow me to fail by picking me in the side if i am unable to prove my worth i will be a fringe player all my life
2419641 you treat both impostors wins and defeats the same way
2419642 you can train twice as hard as a team and lose by one point as you can when you win by one point were certainly still together as a team
2419643 the attitude has been good in training but the bigger test comes this saturday it was definitely not a sense of relief after the hull win the players were stung by the criticism that came their way and the good thing is they responded in the only way they could respond
2419644 you have to treat the trip as a positive if you think of it as a negative it will become a negative
2419645 look at the playing roster and what they have got going im expecting a huge reaction from them after their defeat at hull kr as i was expecting a huge reaction from us last friday
2419646 its a great place to play and saturday is definitely a game i would have loved to play in
2419647 they beat leeds in the challenge cup and blew away wakefield but if we go there thinking we cant do a job or perform we have defeated ourselves before we have taken to the pitch

2419815 in order for patients to enter the hospital setting safely and exit safely there needs to a 1 4 or less of nursing care assigned to a patient clientele
2419816 the demographic is usually of high acuity it is even more important for the sake of patients and for the sake of nurses to do their direct care to ensure those ratios are met
2419817 some nurses are forced to care for as many as 13 patients at one time
2419818 we work with the patients we advocate for them and we said that we cannot do an adequate job for 13 patients at one time we need standards that establish three to four patients per nurse
2419819 we have restrictions on the number of kids in a classroom on the number of fish we can catch and on how many can ride a bus
2419820 but there are no standards on how many patients nurses can be assigned to take care of our priorities are off

2419828 theres always the hope that shell come back and make guest appearances on the show and that the audience will enjoy watching me in the role developing it they get to see a character whos not really cut out to be a leader try to build himself into one
2419829 because the fan base is so loyal they like seeing an actor that they know from one show take on another role in another of their favorite shows
2419830 atlantis i think does action adventure extremely well but most importantly to me it has this sort of breezy humor this ability to wink at the genre that star trek cannot have
2419831 its kind of like a jogging suit i do feel like i should break out into a run down the hallway but i do like it and it also has some slight leisure suit tendencies too i feel a little bit like an escapee from a late seventies early eighties movie

2419837 its not like a bigger game plan in terms of several seasons down the line at the end of every season we leave with usually our season cliffhanger and we kind of have more or less an idea of where we want to pick things up with the first episode were really not that much beyond that
