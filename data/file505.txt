5050000 i interviewed tons of casting directors and discovered all these castings that didnt happen either because some turned down the role or some didnt get it some were just totally wrong for the part and just auditioned
5050001 were all great athletes and im very excited about the tremendous achievement were very good athletes and this says a lot for our country
5050002 i feel bad that it didnt go well i gave it my all but i want to feel that i didnt let my family down he promised his mother after the athens final he would deliver gold in beijing i gave everything i had

5050004 in 1973 through the roe v wade and doe v bolton decisions the supreme court took it upon itself to steal personhood and all rights associated with personhood from the preborn children of the united states

5050007 every time we come here you always think something is going to happen in a negative way and weve got to try to not think that way or say weve got to do this or that
5050008 its an ugly game but we won it i dont know how we did it
5050009 we had the bases loaded with no outs and again with one out and we didnt score those are big situations and they are magnified when youre not scoring every run becomes crucial if we get one or two more runs wed get a few more wins
5050010 i felt like ive been throwing the ball well the last few starts but a mistake here or there cost me
5050011 today i didnt have any mistakes i feel really strong and healthy and we have only two months left important months too
5050012 im at a loss for words for how i felt out there
5050013 sometimes when we pitch well we dont score runs and vice versa
5050014 we need to find more consistency as a team tampa bay is in first place and its nice to take a win out of their category
5050015 but you have to draw the line at some point to make sure all the right things do occur in the years to come

5050130 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5050131 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5050132 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5050133 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5050134 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5050135 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5050136 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5050137 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5050138 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5050139 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5050140 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5050141 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5050142 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5050143 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5050144 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5050145 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5050146 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5050147 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5050148 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5050149 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5050150 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5050151 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5050163 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5050164 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5050165 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5050166 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5050167 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5050168 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5050169 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5050170 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5050171 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5050172 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5050173 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5050174 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5050179 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5050180 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5050181 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5050182 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5050183 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5050184 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5050185 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5050186 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5050187 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5050188 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5050189 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5050190 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5050191 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5050192 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5050193 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5050194 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5050195 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

5050221 money put in the hands of our hard working americans who deserve it
5050222 now we know why obama took the american flag off his lapel on july 24 in berlin he told us the american flag is too small to contain him he is not comfortable being an american citizen only fully comfortable as a citizen of the world
5050223 for me the most important issues are the sanctity of life on all fronts and the importance of good judges respecting the constitution
5050224 can a pro life christian never vote for a pro choice person
5050225 to reflect on some of the assumptions in your post you might run with different 20somethings than i run with but the case of obamamania somehow sweeping over and placing into a hypnotic trance young evangelicals who are otherwise astute and thoughtful far overstates the case its more basic than that the problem is that our options are so terribly limited because we live in the city of man while longing for the city of god to come in its fullness
5050226 i dont understand how any serious christian can be otherwise than being a 1 issue voter
5050227 this reality means that the next president decides the question plain and simple
5050228 you must equivocate on either the morality of abortion or the signficance of its evil to vote for obama at this moment in history
5050229 until this dark period in our moral history is over i am a 1 issue voter
5050230 thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
5050231 the first international polls taken as the united states was preparing to invade iraq surprised americans with findings that most foreigners were hostile to the invasion but focused much of their negativism on george w bush by 2004 and 2005 however the result became hostile in a deeper way the pew global attitudes study for 2004 based on some sixty five hundred interviews in eight countries in addition to the united states found that respondents in every nation but the united states said the war in iraq had hurt not helped the war on terrorism only in britain did a majority of those queried believe the u s war on terror was sincerely directed against international terrorism others thought it was insincere and principally aimed at controlling middle eastern oil
5050232 he bush really isnt interested in faith in general the president didnt flick an eyelash when the national council of churches and the u s council of catholic bishops opposed his war on iraq he didnt listen when the council of american islamic relations filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the patriot act when the union for reformed judaism announced that an antigay marriage amendment would defile the constitution the president took no notice nor did bush respond to a joint call signed by fifty prominent christian leaders including richard cizik of the national association of evangelicals and jim wallis of call to renewal for policies that promote quality health care decent housing and a living income for the poor his is not an embrace of spirituality or ethics broadly speaking or of faith as an important voice among many in the national debate it is instead an embrace of right wing christian fundamentalism
5050233 the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal

5050245 when we arrived the news came that gori was being shelled
5050246 i dont know why it is being presented that russia invaded georgia this is all disinformation and lies its an information war
5050247 justifying what the kgb people are doing in my country
5050248 when it comes to apportioning blame for the latest flareup in the caucasus theres plenty to go around the russians were clearly itching for a fight but the behaviour of georgian president mikhail saakashvili has been erratic and provocative the united states may have stoked the conflict by encouraging saakashvili to believe that he enjoyed american protection when the wests ability to impose its will in this part of the world is actually quite limited it is difficult to explain why kosovo should have the right to unilaterally declare its independence from serbia while the same right should be denied to places such as south ossetia and abkhazia
5050249 given how overt the kremlins aims are the fiery nationalist president of georgia mikheil saakashvili blundered grievously when he responded to small scale violence from local separatists in south ossetia by sending georgian troops to shell and assault the breakaway regions capital city
5050250 even the most ardent adversaries of moscow have no choice but to accept it was georgian military forces that attacked the separatist pro russian province of south ossetia bombarding its capital and killing russian peacekeepers who had been there for 15 years following the un decision to maintain peace from the moment bush became president he has wanted russia to be isolated both economically and geographically he must think there is no difference between yesterdays soviet union and todays russia for a moment putin believed in bushs friendship and tried to provide some gauge of good will wasnt it him who removed russian military bases from cuba and vietnam has he not joined the osce and thats despite the disillusion and anger when the us installed military bases in central asia georgia the czech republic and poland

5050265 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safe haven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5050266 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5050267 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time

5050279 saya yakin mohd saiful telah menjalani proses mengangkat sumpah secara tertib mengikut apa yang disyariatkan dalam islam
5050280 ini termasuklah diadakan di dalam masjid pada hari jumaat dalam keadaan suci berwuduk berkiblatkan kaabah serta mengucapkan lafaz wallahi wabillahi dan watallahi
5050281 kerana itu saya mencabar mereka yang mengkritik mohd saiful untuk tampil menunjukkan cara yang betul bagi membuktikan kaedah yang digunakan oleh anak saya adalah salah katanya
5050282 saya minta mereka berhenti mempersoalkan perkara remeh sedemikian kerana anak saya telah mengangkat sumpah dengan cara yang betul di sisi islam bukan dengan pegangan agama lain
5050283 yang penting keikhlasan dan keberanian beliau untuk menjalani proses itu tanpa keraguan jadi hentikanlah mengkritik ujarnya

5050322 you might be on the field but you cant see everything out there
5050323 when you watch the tape you see even more that gives everybody a chance to make this team
5050324 the difference between the 53rd player and the 59th player is this big
5050325 because a lot of the coaches here are putting their scheme in and making sure that everybody learns the scheme and knows where theyre supposed to be
5050326 but at the end of the day you could care less about the scheme youre looking at the performance of the individual as a head coach sometimes ive got to watch the practice film three or four times
5050327 you want to see the team and the performance youve got to take some notes because youve got some tough decisions to make
5050328 we might sign a player the seventh or eighth day of camp
5050329 during lunch time a guy might go into a room and watch a meeting
5050330 all you have is that eye in the sky everything thats on the tape everything you do on the field its going to be judged
5050331 when you step on the grass you better do your best
5050332 im getting used to all of the people watching you with their notebooks out you usually see them writing stuff down
5050333 my first year it was definitely a big stress id be looking around wondering if they were writing something down about me am i doing something good am i doing something bad now i know i just worry about what im doing between the lines
5050334 now ive got to put even better stuff on tape
5050335 how can i contribute as a receiver how can i contribute on special teams
5050336 its a whole new ballgame its a whole new season
5050337 youve got to go out there with the thought that everything is being watched
5050338 because they really do have cameras all over the field
5050339 every mistake that you do make youre definitely thinking about it you definitely have to approach practice like its the most important play of your life
5050340 i mean look at a player like me im trying to make the roster i cant slack off on any play ive got to produce on every play if you slack off youre going to be going home
5050341 youve got to be trustworthy i think to be a championship football team
5050342 youve got to be versatile youve got to be able to play a couple of different positions youve got to contribute in the kicking game
5050343 youve got to be a team man you have to understand that clearly all of those things are being evaluated at the end of the day youve got to make plays

5050345 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5050346 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5050347 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5050348 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5050349 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5050350 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5050351 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5050352 security forces want to focus on the true fight right now but they are forced into a two front war to stop reprisals in the population
5050353 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5050354 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5050355 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5050356 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5050357 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5050358 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5050359 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5050360 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5050361 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5050362 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5050363 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5050364 i want to make a name for myself in this profession

5050377 finances tips to protect you and your assets after the divorce is final
5050378 divorce is as much about starting a new life as it is about ending a relationship
5050379 one of the most immediate things is to get a good handle on your assets your income and your expenses
5050380 its easy to figure out income whats a little more difficult to figure out are expenses you have to understand youre not going to have the same lifestyle as prior to the divorce and things are going to keep changing what may make sense today might change drastically over time so keep meticulous track of your expenses
5050381 if your divorce was just finalized you may want to get a jumpstart on your financial decisions but this isnt necessarily the best approach
5050382 another important financial tip is to stay informed about your credit rating
5050383 co author of on my own two feet a modern girls guide to personal finance manisha thakor says anyone going through a divorce should remember that good personal finance does not have to be difficult when you boil it all down every single piece of personal finance advice falls into one of three buckets 1 save 2 invest 3 protect try not to become overwhelmed remember to keep putting something into savings each month try and invest 15 percent of your income in simple stable funds and protect yourself with adequate insurance
5050384 remember that managing your finances is an ongoing process another useful tip from barbara shapiro is to empower yourself by reading taking classes and talking to your financial advisor especially if you werent the one managing your finances before the divorce craig hyldahl agrees that there must be ongoing monitoring and constant contact between clients and financial advisors by keeping track of how your expenses income and investments grow or change over time youll be in a better position to make financial decisions
5050385 probably the most important thing to keep in mind is dont panic youre probably dealing with the largest lump sum youre going to get along with the most stressful time in your life says hyldahl so avoid the tendency to feel overwhelmed take your time make sure you have all the financial records you need dont hire a financial advisor until youve asked a lot of questions and established mutual goals and trust try not to spend more than you need to until youve got a firm financial plan in place
5050386 and finally its important to remember youre not alone while its natural to fear whether youll be able to take care of yourself financially speaking dont for a minute think you are alone in that concern writes manisha thakor a whopping 70 percent of americans live paycheck to paycheck and that cuts across income spectrums as you begin your new life stay informed positive and proactive when it comes to your finances and your situation will most likely continue to improve

5050392 especially in the second half i thought our tactical kicking really stepped up and we just kept making them come out of their own 22 which is tough
5050393 theres a big improvement there and its become a big part of our game and one of the reasons that got us home
5050394 weve been working on guys looking for space and communicating it the champion that dan is you cant rely on him to make all the calls and i think hes now got good help around him
5050395 they showed tremendous courage and i think thats what won the game their courage and their fitness in the last 20 minutes
5050396 as a coach you feel very proud they had that togetherness
5050397 defence really set the attitude for us and when you make gang tackles it makes it a lot easier to get turnovers at the breakdown
5050398 with 15 to go you could feel we were getting on top of them we were playing in the right part of the field and putting them under pressure in their own half so you could feel the momentum swing our way
5050399 xabi has had a dead leg so we had to protect him
5050400 at the end of the game plessis was injured too so we had to change we knew xabi was only maybe 80 of his ability so it was to protect him
5050401 xabi is our player and he is playing well if he continues to play well i will be really pleased but it doesnt matter if you have one good player and you need another one you have to keep the balance of the team
5050402 i explained to him why i needed money for signing other players
5050403 he can understand if you have javier mascherano lucas steven gerrard and then plessis you have four other midfielders and maybe you can sell one player
5050404 when i was first talking with xabi about a transfer we needed money after these months it is not a question of money we would have to have a massive offer because alonso is a great player
5050405 but if we sell one or two players we have enough money to bring in one more good player
5050406 dont forget we will need eight british players and the left footer we were talking about can play in three positions too
5050407 i have the support of at least one of the owners
5050408 i sent emails to all of them but he hicks was clear we had the money
5050409 we have to take this on the chin but performance wise i am pleased we had one or two chances and when you play the big boys you have to take those chances
5050410 last year when we played a team like liverpool i hoped wed get a result when i woke up before this match i believed we would and thats the progress we have made
5050411 i think liverpool will have got on their bus and been glad to see the back of us and thats a good sign
5050412 i have always imagined that paradise will be a kind of library

5050431 my instinct would be for john terry because he is the type of naturally courageous player who leads his team mates by example
5050432 but rio ferdinand so much more mature than five years ago would be a clever choice for another reason terry would give 100 percent whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances but ferdinand might find an extra 10 percent in his game by being captain
5050433 ive noticed with ferdinand that the bigger the stage the better he plays he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games by giving ferdinand the responsibility of leading his country out you almost guarantee world class performances from him

5050437 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer

5050453 so to recap you are naked except for your bra and suspenders i kneel before you you stand and
5050454 now my antipodean admirer you are mine for today down on your knees amp close your eyes i obey amp feel the softness of a stocking tied over my eyes i smile
5050455 now stand amp remove your clothes i obey amp hear your digital camera beep you see my frown just a souvenir for me alone no need to panic that comes later
5050456 you walk behind me you cup my ass and squeeze my cheeks firmly i moan softly you whisper
5050457 i shudder at your words hands behind your back i slowly obey amp you tie my wrists with your other stocking theres a minutes silence amp you untie my blindfold
5050458 the sight of your semi naked body causes my cock to harden your pale skin freckles and flame red
5050459 and that wicked little smile like a cat having just been given a bowl of cream and you look very very hungry you smile and sloly unhook your bra i gasp
5050460 i gaze at your breasts as you lower your bra in your arms a little lower slowly exposing the area
5050461 your tongue running over your teeth your lips all the while your devious smile shows the anticipation the moment holds for you hmmmmm somethings missing
5050462 that smile again you take the remaining stocking and slowly push it deep into your pussy now get
5050463 as my lips close to yours you grab my hair and look into my eyes gently now no teeth take the
5050464 as my tongue delves deeper into you your fingers tease your nipples before making their way to your
5050465 a mouthful of stocking is soon joined by your cum your body writhes against my face i try to control my breathing but your need for satisfaction drives me on
5050466 as control returns to your body so does your smile mmmm good boy now dont forget to lick the

5050473 i could not dream of a better start to score in my first game after four minutes now i will have to continue week in and week out and hopefully i can keep playing like that it will be brilliant
5050474 when i first met the boss he said that maybe i would need a bit of time maybe up to six months but actually i felt really good straight away there were not that many problems in adapting to playing in england
5050475 i have a programme with the physio to get stronger because everyone has told me english football is different with more contact it is just to be stronger and to be able to cope with the 50 50s with the intensity of english football i am working hard in training and felt good out on the pitch
5050476 it is flattering but also a bit annoying because that is a lot of pressure it is hard to be compared to such a player the best of the past 10 years in european football
5050477 it is a lot of pressure and i would rather be known as samir nasri
5050478 he has a bit of robert pires in him because he looks to be able to change direction very easily
5050479 nasri had a bad season last year because he had meningitis he was in hospital for two weeks then did not recover properly for three months they rushed him back to play and he was not at the expected level the year before everybody wanted him sometimes you have to be brave enough when everybody says he is not good

5050485 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
5050486 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5050487 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
5050488 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5050489 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
5050490 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
5050491 but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle which is swollen up badly and hell be out for two to three weeks we lost a bit of our experience in midfield

5050498 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safe haven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5050499 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5050500 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5050501 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they militants would have known women and children were present
5050502 i have often wondered if your work at the slade school of london and under edmund sullivan was of value to you as an illustrator
5050503 at slade academic and searching drawing was so insisted upon that draftsmanship became second nature i did nothing but draw from the model eight hours a day for two years this experience created a backlog to which i constantly refer even now i may disagree with some of the preceps laid down but i will never regret the spartan grind we went through then
5050504 as i look back upon it the standards were so rigid and academic in the best sense that in self defense one had to find a personal expression or be reduced to an automaton but i think it was not until ten years later that i was able to gain access to what that drawing was doing for me at the time in the end i think that this kind of training a discriminating eye and an obedient hand achieved what it set out to do the student became so aware of the normal aspect of things that accuracy became no longer interesting and energy was released for a more creative kind of seeing

5050520 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5050839 that whole we they stigma of the gender difference is becoming not as significant in 2008 as it was in 98 or 88 or 78
5050840 there was a long time even when i started this was thought of as a mans job
5050841 at least in missoula were showing that thats not necessarily the case
5050842 id put it on the toilet paper roll but then it falls off
5050843 its having a realistic idea of what were capable of
5050844 we know were smaller we know we may not be as big and strong
5050845 when i trained connie wed talk and id say youve got to be aggressive
5050846 she was probably ready to tackle me by the end of it
5050847 i feel incredibly lucky to have this group of gals because i think its not a relationship id ever been able to have with the men
5050848 my husband understands i work with a bunch of men and that we get in some pretty intense situations
5050849 and he understands if i dont want to talk about my day hes had those days too
5050850 but its also nice because when we do talk about it i can talk specific with him without violating any confidentiality issues
5050851 but i think i became much more determined to stay safe and get home at night when i had my son
5050852 i think all of us as women are very good at multitasking
5050853 but i think all of us are very healthy in terms of getting it out processing staying healthy and moving on
5050854 because you know what you cant dwell too much on that case because youve got another one coming
5050855 sometimes im frustrated im sad im lonely i hate it
5050856 then i think gosh darn it its fun its physical its very interesting
5050857 i want to know the dirty dark gnarly stuff that nobody else wants to see because theres something really interesting there and fascinating
5050858 you hear about everyones worst day you ask for the disgusting details tell them youll try to make things better and try not to let it affect your life
5050859 you hug your family harder you clean your house a little deeper and hope to god you can realize not everyone is bad
5050860 thats what people have always come to see in the park
5050861 they came to look into the past to see something pristine to me the parks first century was defined by a certain stability
5050862 the mountains and the depth of nature seemed very long lived theyd always been here and always would be here
5050863 weve come to a very interesting turning point if the first century was defined by the past and by stability then the second century is the exact opposite now were looking at the future and at remarkable instability now all of a sudden were faced with how fragile a system like this can be
5050864 weve always gone to nature because it is so huge and we are so little
5050865 weve gone to feel humble and to put ourselves in perspective but today when we go were also reminded that we actually affect everything theres not a place on the planet that we havent touched not even a wilderness like glacier
5050866 no amount of preparation will ready us for whats to come
5050867 because by mid century things are really going to start changing here in ways well all see and feel directly
5050868 the main constant is that americans love their national parks and they especially love glacier national park
5050869 have been flat or on the decline for many many years
5050870 parks like glacier are the anchor stores of our economy
5050871 and it makes sense to invest in them the centennial is a good time to be thinking about how to do that
5050872 were going to have to make some tough choices in glaciers second century
5050873 what we have here is a learning moment and were trying to capitalize on that
5050874 we have glaciers that are receding and infrastructure that is deteriorating and more visitors all the time this is tangible stuff people can touch it they can see it with their own eyes
5050875 what we really want is to use the centennial to create programs that last well into the future
5050876 we dont want a crazy sugar buzz up to 2010 thats just going to crash in 2011 we need to keep our eyes on the long term future here
5050877 but this is way more than just a birthday party
5050878 this is a whole program of events that look back at the past and hopefully build for the future
5050879 those are projects wed like to have done by the birthday
5050880 combining the park with the nonprofits and the local communities because we all rely on our partners more than ever
5050881 the need has never been greater and the time to get involved has never been better
5050882 i think we can do it faster leaner and cleaner than any other manufacturer

5050887 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5050888 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5050889 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there

5050891 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
5050892 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
5050893 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
5050894 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
5050895 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
5050896 the operating theory behind the war on terror which involves massive us intervention in central asia to control vital resources fragment russia and surround manufacturing giant china
5050897 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
5050898 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
5050899 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
5050900 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
5050901 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
5050902 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

5050935 both of them were like snakes i bet if you cut their heads off they would still keep slithering for hours too
5050936 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it

5050945 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5050946 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5050949 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5050950 we have agreed along with our partners in poland and the czech republic to give the russians access both physical and technical access so they know whats going on every step of the way
5050951 weve agreed not to even make the interceptors operational until the iranians have test launched a missile that has the range to hit much of western europe not to mention russia so this russian warning is really an old song that theyre singing and it really just doesnt play

5050956 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5050957 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5050958 it cant be described well never ever see it again

5050960 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun

5050974 that this administration has no regard whatsoever for what needs to be held sacred
5050975 at the end of the day you have to question whether this administration has led with our values or used our values as a cloak to justify its ideology and unilateralism
5050976 our constitution is being shredded it is a stunning record of secrecy and corruption of cronyism run amok it is everything our founders were afraid of everything our constitution was designed to prevent
5050977 bush and cheney fail to understand that the extent of a presidents power doesnt rest in how far he is willing to stretch the statutes or the constitution presidential power comes from the force of a presidents argument the righteousness of a presidents cause and the support and consent of the american people
5050978 answer to this delicate security dilemma is neither blank checks nor blanket opposition it is to use the judicial and legislative mechanisms we have to build a consensus about what is necessary what is legal and what is effective
5050979 we do not fear transparency into the workings of our government when we aim to hold every part of our government accountable then we much more than in words but in deeds promote the rule of law
5050980 the president acted without authority and it is our duty now to be careful in handing this president just the right amount of authority to get the job done
5050981 giving the bush cheney administration a blank check to torture to create secret courts using secret evidence to detain people including americans to be free of judicial oversight and accountability to put our troops in greater danger
5050982 im proposing that we have a new privacy bill of rights and a new national security consensus setting out clear rules to allow the government to use new intelligence techniques within a rule of law framework and making sure that the public knows its rights and the governments limits

5050991 fue a las 12 30 horas del jueves 20 de noviembre de 1952 cuando establec contacto en persona con un hombre de otro mundo hab a venido a la tierra en una nave espacial un platillo volante
5050992 una gigantesca nave plateada con forma de puro sin alas ni ap ndices de ning n tipo
5050993 me sent a como un ni o en presencia de alguien poseedor de una gran sabidur a y mucho amor
5050994 era hombre de exiguos logros acad micos pero compensaba tal deficiencia con una excelente imaginaci n una agradable personalidad y una provisi n aparentemente inagotable de desfachatez
5050995 tras ocho a os de pacientes investigaciones recordaba en 1967 llegu finalmente a la conclusi n de que su nave espacial era en realidad el extremo superior de una aspiradora fabricada en 1937 y dudo que se pueda viajar a trav s del espacio montado en una aspiradora

5050999 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5051000 assured that georgians will not continue to use military force
5051001 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5051002 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5051003 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5051004 i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not
5051005 however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5051006 it was a flagrant and a blatant false start that was not recalled and had tremendous impact on the race
5051007 but theyre not going to rerun the olympic 100 anyone who knows anything knows that
5051008 im going to concentrate on the 5 im not going to cry

5051010 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5051011 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5051012 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5051013 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5051014 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5051015 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5051016 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee

5051042 as with millions across the country i have been closely following the progress of the british team in the olympic games chris hoy and his british teammates achievement yesterday in the team sprint was an exceptional feat of sporting excellence but for chris to crown it today with another gold and a silver for ross edgar is remarkable it is a great source of pride to all of us in scotland that chris and ross are among the many scots competing as part of team gb
5051043 this is a fantastic achievement for chris hoy and ross edgar and scotlands greatest sporting moment at the olympics of all time with scots winning a gold and silver in the same event this was the braveheart final and chris and ross did scotland proud
5051044 its gb at the olympics so its the gb flag on commonwealth games business its the saltire and lion rampant first of all scotland would have to build three velodromes at 50m a time to match uk facilities then theres world class performance funding 4m a year and it takes eight years to get a medal multiply that across all sports and scotland would be facing a huge sports bill
5051045 so glad we are beginning to see clear blue water in this civil matter of flag waving in scotland yes it is a civil matter between scots and jockbrits choose your 1 flag carefully choose your 1 nation carefully no britain is not a nation so think again or choose which city of said nation you would prefer to be governed from stick yer british flag up yer union jacksy

5051053 i understood that when you love you must either in your reasoning about that love start from what is highest from what is more important than happiness or unhappiness sin or virtue in their accepted meaning or you must not reason at all

5051058 we know of some 180 israelis who have been murdered during the last six years by terrorists who have been released
5051059 terrorists who have been released are going to go back to the business they know how to do and they will encourage others to do what they know as well
5051060 young man lift up your eyes and appreciate whom you are selecting to marry look not at beauty but rather at the family
5051061 is positive from one standpoint it shows that people want to love true they sometimes take advantage of it for various negative things that are very unacceptable but the inner point of this striving for love for goodness for the ability to give to others and to feel united this is something that we should try to develop of course in a pure and holy manner
5051062 this is a gesture and a trust building move aimed at bolstering the moderates in the palestinian authority and the peace process
5051063 if we compare what abu mazen abbas will get in two weeks what hizbullah got looks miniscule
5051064 i did not object to it because it creates a good atmosphere
5051065 when israel releases terrorists only for those who use force against us such as hizbullah and hamas we broadcast that we cave in to pressures and that using force against us and kidnapping soldiers are the only way to act against us
5051066 this government makes sure to repair all the damage it caused by doing something even worse if it wouldnt have surrendered in its negotiations with hamas and hizbullah it would not have had to give in now to fatah and release terrorists for nothing in exchange
5051067 the decision to release over 200 terrorists as a gesture to abu mazen crushes the public confidence that terrorists and murderers must face justice it will hurt the security of israeli citizens and will harm the efforts to free gilad shalit kidnapped over two years ago by hamas associated terrorists we can only imagine how the release of 200 terrorists at no cost will affect the minimum demands that hamas will now present for shalit
5051068 the blood of the innocent victims who will be killed by the released terrorists will be on the head of this government
5051069 a government that frees terrorists as a gesture and not even as part of an exchange is a government that has no regard for the justice system that convicted them nor for human life and has blood on its own hands
5051070 big time and not only by hiding its weapons in warehouses in the south
5051071 the un decision does not obligate us and it does not carry weight with us what israel did not succeed in taking during war it will not succeed with diplomacy and politics
5051072 at this moment hizbullah is one of the parties that agrees with 1701
5051073 in the face of threats we face including iran syria hizbullah and hamas
5051074 present a dilemma between defense and welfare is deceiving welfare and education are part of defense and a responsible leadership must simultaneously achieve social strength and security
5051075 this week saw the two year anniversary since the end of the second lebanon war which demonstrated to all of us in the most painful way the heavy price of neglecting the military and minimizing the defense budgets in the years that preceded the war
5051076 a direct result of the cut in defense budgets during those same years
5051077 ive only missed it one time since it started coming to naples
5051078 i jumped from my chair when he came to me with the idea
5051079 i told him its going to hit theyre all desperate for kosher products
5051080 the police came to arrest us after the arabs claimed that we had attacked them
5051081 because of the weak claim that the arabs had complained first
5051082 had nothing to confess since we did not shoot but even more importantly
5051083 i have no intention of apologizing for having gone out to protect jews even if i have to sit in prison for a few months i will not say that it is wrong to do what i did what do we have a state for if not to protect ourselves the state has lost its way
5051084 the courts took the strange position that because we didnt make certain claims at the right time our conviction stands this is unheard of first of all our legal claim is one that can be made at any time and the courts are simply not following the law but regardless of this how can they send two upstanding citizens to jail merely because of a technicality this is totally unjust
5051085 the justice system simply doesnt know how to deal with arab aggression therefore the easiest targets for their frustration are those on the frontline like us in this case and shai dromi and the settlers jewish residents of judea and samaria in general if the legal system were to exonerate us this would be an admission that we are doing the security job that the country is supposed to do on its own but is failing at
5051086 my clients were convicted amidst total disregard of the police blunder in not having performed ballistic checks on the guns in addition the arab identification of the brothers was done improperly and is not acceptable as evidence
5051087 s lo tienen que hacer esto y esto y lo de m s all

5051098 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5051099 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5051100 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5051101 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida

5051104 voting is the heart of the democratic process and we are pursuing a recount as that is the fairest way possible to make sure the peoples voice through the election is most accurately heard
5051105 i have received encouragement to pursue the recount from an overwhelming number of democratic primary voters at this stage the recount becomes a legal procedure

5051139 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5051140 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5051141 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
5051142 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials

5051158 dit maakt toch wel dat wonen in genk in zwartberg dan nog wel heel speciaal is
5051159 ik maakte kennis met enkele buren waaronder cubaanse italiaanse spaanse russische poolse en belgische gezinnen we hebben op straat gezellig staan praten over dagdagelijkse dingen zoals het weer vakantie en onze kinderen maar ook onderwerpen zoals werkgelegenheid en koopkracht bleven niet onbesproken
5051160 stany en ik hebben toch wel nood aan beweging en verschillende pogingen om samen te sporten waren voordien mislukt tot mn broer een tip gaf over een dansclub in bocholt waar hijzelf iedere week de benen strekt je moet het maar eens proberen n uur effectief dansen het zweet stond dat eerste uur al op mijn lijf maar het is plezierig en bovendien goed voor onze relatie in september staan we weer op de dansvloer
5051161 we maken heel graag uitstappen met de kinderen en trekken er dan ook regelmatig op uit ondermeer naar bokrijk naar de speeltuin daarna eten we een lekker ijsje in t cornetje in boxberg het is fijn dat er in genk zon groot speelterrein bestaat waar je bovendien gratis gebruik kan van maken maar evenzeer is het belangrijk dat kinderen kunnen spelen in goed onderhouden speelpleinen die zo worden aangelegd dat zowel jong als oud er iets aan heeft vooral voor kinderen die in een krap behuisde woning leven moeten zulke speelterreinen dicht bij huis toch echt wel een verademing zijn
5051162 oudere mensen kunnen spelende kinderen gadeslaan vanop de bank en leren zo de kinderen uit de buurt kennen en omgekeerd hier kan alleen iedereen beter van worden want mensen komen buiten en automatisch worden er sociale contacten gelegd n onderhouden het is alleen jammer dat de speeltuinen in de verschillende wijken van genk niet altijd even goed onderhouden worden ik vind dat de stad genk hier meer inspanningen zou mogen leveren

5051167 the non partisan group campaign money watch has come up with another startling figure for those who follow the presidential money chase according to an analysis performed by the group mccains top fundraisers and aides have collected nearly 1 billion in fees from u s companies in the past decade specifically 930 949 819 using numbers provided by the center for responsive politics the group also found that officials of those very same companies have given nearly 12 million to mccains presidential campaign so far

5051169 most u s and foreign corporations doing business in the united states avoid paying any federal income taxes despite trillions of dollars worth of sales a government study released on tuesday said the government accountability office said 72 percent of all foreign corporations and about 57 percent of u s companies doing business in the united states paid no federal income taxes for at least one year between 1998 and 2005 during that time corporate sales in the united states totaled 2 5 trillion according to democratic sens carl levin of michigan and byron dorgan of north dakota who requested the gao study unfortunately the report failed to name names hopefully some intrepid reporters will get to the bottom of it i wonder where the oil companies stand in this whole mess i cant imagine it being good for john mccains case if say exxonmobil was getting huge government subsidies while also avoiding paying income taxes

5051174 air new zealand has announced reductions in air fares to sydney and melbourne and the number of people travelling on that route is expected to skyrocket as a result spokesman bruce parton says the tasman route is one of the most competitive areas of business for the airline and it needs to make sure the 50 to 60 million it has invested in new aircraft is paid back through full planes mr parton says the way to do that is to slash the cost of travel across the tasman by between 33 and 50 per cent from october air new zealands one way fare to sydney will be 249 and to melbourne it will be 199 president of the travel agents association peter barlow says air new zealand hopes to compensate for a reduction in long haul traffic by slashing fares in an attempt to fill short haul flights he says the increase in fuel prices means air new zealand needs to fill their planes up and this is an effective way of doing that mr barlow says in a fuel crisis long haul flights get hit hardest he says with high fuel prices and half full planes planes still need to be fully fuelled so slashing fares is one way to ensure more people travel

5051236 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5051237 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5051238 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5051239 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them

5051256 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
5051257 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt

5051263 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5051264 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

5051296 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop robin pemberton vice president of competition for nascar said sunday
5051297 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5051298 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5051299 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet pemberton said when asked if the penalties were likely to be severe

5051302 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
5051303 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5051304 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
5051305 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
5051306 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5051307 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
5051308 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5051309 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5051310 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

5051312 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
5051313 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
5051314 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5051315 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
5051316 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
5051317 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
5051318 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5051319 the whole point of calculating the portfolio twr is to remove the effect of cash flows on performance thereby making a comparison to a benchmark relevent the benchmark returns do not have any cash flows associated with them and neither does the portfolios twr so its an apples to apples comparison
5051320 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5051321 say you had 10 000 at the beginning of the year and your investments did great in the first 3 months your 10 000 turned into 12 000 without you adding a penny now on april 1 you put in 20 000 more but your investments stalled in the rest of the year and you end the year with 32 000 so you made 20 on 10 000 in the first 3 months and you made 0 on 32 000 in the next 9 months if you plug in these values in a spreadsheet and use the xirr function you get 8 this makes sense because 10000 1 8 1 4 10194 10194 20000 1 8 3 4 31988 pretty close except for rounding if you didnt put in additional 20 000 on april 1 your return wouldve been 20 thats how your investment choices did and thats how fidelity or schwab will report to you theres a big difference between the 8 dollar weighted rate of return and the 20 time weighted rate of return because the cash flow in this example is unusually large if we change the additional contribution on april 1 from 20 000 to 1 000 and have the end of year value at 13 000 instead of 32 000 the two returns would be much closer the dollar weighted rate of return would be 18 6 and the time weighted rate of return would still be 20

5051366 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
5051367 the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
5051368 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5051369 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5051370 its not something that i would have recommended but theyre trying to bend over backwards as far as they can to accommodate her
5051371 i think the roll call will be a cathartic moment
5051372 there will be a lot of people who will say oh what might have been and will vote for obama but there will be a lot of tears
5051373 were not going to win by pretending problems with barack obama dont exist he has a huge problem connecting with ordinary americans who think he doesnt understand me he is not modest he is arrogant he radiates elitism
5051374 it is not disloyal to raise legitimate questions about barack obama
5051375 he started running for president before he even set foot in the us senate
5051376 no matter what he says he has not explained properly why he sat next to reverend jeremiah wright his former pastor for 20 years he talks about an end to partisanship but he has no record of reaching across the aisle for any purpose
5051377 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
5051378 barack obama can use the words the american dream but they dont resonate
5051379 he magnified the problem by going to berlin and calling himself a citizen of the world
5051380 he has provided her with a pittance compared to what the clintons have given obama
5051381 her debt could have been cleared within 10 days its ungracious
5051382 barack obama would not stand up and say its outrageous its not permissible and speak up for him
5051383 but ultimately he understands what he has got to do in terms of supporting the candidate and the party
5051384 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
5051385 without doubt obama is more comfortable talking the language of religion than mccain in the past republicans talked about god and jesus and the democrats were silent this year their roles are reversed

5051400 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time

5051410 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5051411 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5051412 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5051413 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5051414 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that

5051417 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5051418 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do

5051432 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5051433 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst

5051447 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5051448 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
5051449 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5051450 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5051451 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services
5051452 a year from today well still be talking about financial problems its not going away
5051453 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5051454 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5051455 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5051456 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5051457 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5051458 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5051459 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5051460 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5051461 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5051462 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5051463 just so you all know we did set a record
5051464 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5051465 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5051466 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5051467 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
5051468 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
5051469 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
5051470 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
5051471 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
5051472 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
5051473 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
5051474 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
5051475 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
5051476 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5051477 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5051478 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5051479 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5051480 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5051481 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5051482 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5051483 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5051484 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5051485 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5051486 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5051487 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5051488 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5051489 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5051490 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5051491 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5051492 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5051493 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5051494 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5051495 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5051496 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5051497 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5051498 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5051499 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5051500 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5051501 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5051502 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5051503 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5051504 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5051505 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5051506 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5051507 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5051508 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5051509 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5051510 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5051511 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5051512 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5051513 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5051514 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5051515 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5051516 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5051517 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5051518 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5051519 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5051520 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5051521 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5051522 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5051523 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5051524 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5051525 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5051526 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5051527 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5051528 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5051529 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5051530 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5051531 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5051532 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5051533 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5051534 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5051535 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5051536 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5051537 once upon a time i counted on my treo to alert me when id missed a call or text message
5051538 de una forma realista por la plata ya que las chinas y sobre todo rusia tienen un equipo estupendo tanto en d o como por equipos
5051539 all i can do is be me whoever that is
5051540 emotional support animal your landlord has have to provide reasonable accomodation
5051541 s sei mesmo que sinto uma esp cie de saudade de todo mundo que entra na est ria
5051542 ent o meninas como que voc s percebem que eu estou apaixonada que na minha cabe a eu n o vou trat lo como mais um
5051543 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5051544 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5051545 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5051546 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5051547 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5051548 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5051549 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5051550 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5051551 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5051552 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5051553 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5051554 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5051555 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5051556 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5051557 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5051558 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5051559 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5051560 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5051561 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5051562 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5051563 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5051564 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5051565 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5051566 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5051567 pandora is one of the nations most popular web radio services with about 1 million listeners daily
5051568 generally a mans arm span equals his height but in his case its 67
5051569 backstory is a quick way to catch up on how a story has developed over time
5051570 now when we want to give history context and background to a developing story we go back through our archives to find milestone events and then link those together in an interactive
5051571 watch it change works using the iphones built in camera
5051572 if youre happy with 2 6 however keep on using it you need not upgrade to 2 6 1 if 2 6 is getting the job done
5051573 menyebut tentang muka surat ada juga yang bertanya kepada saya kenapa ebook ini hanya 17 muka surat dan tidak padan dengan harga yang saya jual saya ingin bertanya kepada anda adakah harga sesebuah ebook bergantung kepada jumlah muka surat atau isi kandungan ebook tersebut dan support yang diberikan oleh penulis apa guna ebook yang mempunyai lebih 100 muka surat sedangkan isinya bukan asli hanya copy and paste daripada sumber sumber di internet seperti blog dan forum
5051574 oleh kerana saya bukan penulis yang baik saya tak mampu menulis ayat yang berjela jela untuk menerangkan sesuatu fakta jadi pendekatan saya adalah straight to the point dan menggunakan screenshot sebagai contoh alhamdulillah setakat ini feedback yang saya terima dari pembeli mengatakan mereka lebih mudah memahami dengan cara ini
5051575 dan tidak seperti ebook ebook lain saya juga tidak menulis tentang latar belakang saya atau pengenalan diri saya kerana saya beranggapan orang yang membeli ebook tersebut bukan mahu membaca mengenai saya tetapi sebaliknya tentang apa yang saya tulis
5051576 ada juga yang mempersoalkan tentang saya yang baru sebulan lebih menggunakan zangocash tetapi terus menulis ebook bagi mereka saya masih tidak cukup pengetahuan atau pengalaman memang saya akui pengetahuan dan pengalaman saya tentang zangocash masih cetek malah saya masih belum menerima bayaran pertama tetapi jangan risau zangocash memang bayar publishernya saya ada beberapa orang kawan yang sudah menerima bayaran tetapi apa yang saya nak tekankan di sini ialah walaupun pengetahuan saya tentang zangocash ini masih cetek tetapi saya mampu menjana pendapatan sehingga 50 sehari
5051577 tak cukup dengan itu sales page saya juga turut dipersoalkan kenapa terlalu ringkas dan pendek tidak seperti sales page lain yang panjang berjela sehingga naik pening membacanya dan juga lenguh tangan scroll page tersebut terus terang saya cakap saya memang tidak suka sales page yang panjang berjela yang penuh dengan hype hype yang entah apa apa hanya untuk melariskan produk
5051578 dan perkara terakhir yang dipertikaikan adalah kenapa tidak ada bonus yang lumayan bonus yang saya berikan hanyalah peluang menyertai program affiliate dan juga forum rahsia khusus untuk pembeli tidak ada bonus bonus yang yang harganya berpuluh kali ganda dari ebook yang membuatkan pembeli fikir banyak kali nak komplen tentang kualiti ebook kerana rasa terhutang dengan bonus bonus tersebut
5051579 cara untuk lambat berjaya ialah dengan lambat bertindak dan cara mudah untuk gagal ialah dengan terus berhenti bertindak
5051580 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5051581 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5051582 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5051583 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5051584 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5051585 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5051586 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5051587 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5051588 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5051589 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5051590 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5051591 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5051592 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5051593 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5051594 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5051595 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5051596 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5051597 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5051598 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5051599 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5051600 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5051601 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5051602 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
5051603 he doesnt listen carefully to people and make reasoned judgments
5051604 if john says im going with so and so you cant count on that the next morning
5051605 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
5051606 it screams at you from across the street i look this way because i need to
5051607 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5051608 this is a planning took where all things are going
5051609 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5051610 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5051611 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5051612 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5051613 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5051614 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5051615 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5051616 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5051617 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5051618 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5051619 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5051620 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5051621 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5051622 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5051623 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5051624 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5051625 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5051626 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5051627 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5051628 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5051629 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5051630 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5051631 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5051632 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5051633 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5051634 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5051635 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5051636 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5051637 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5051638 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5051639 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5051640 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5051641 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5051642 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5051643 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5051644 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5051645 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5051646 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5051647 suatu hari saya menemukan kapur barus di dalam hidung anak saya
5051648 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5051649 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5051650 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5051651 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5051652 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5051653 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5051654 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5051655 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5051656 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5051657 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5051658 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5051659 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5051660 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5051661 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5051662 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5051663 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5051664 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5051665 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5051666 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5051667 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5051668 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5051669 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5051670 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5051671 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5051672 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5051673 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5051674 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5051675 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5051676 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5051677 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5051678 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5051679 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5051680 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5051681 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5051682 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5051683 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5051684 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5051685 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5051686 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5051687 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5051688 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5051689 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5051690 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5051691 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5051692 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5051693 my smile will make me famous on broadway my cousin is already there doing really well
5051694 desaf o a los candidatos a alcalde a firmar ante notario sus propuestas
5051695 you can get into your head that its only the associate countries
5051696 but the standard is very good there are a lot of county cricketers and ex pros who play there are a lot of experienced cricketers
5051697 one thing that sticks out for me is the hunger and the intensity
5051698 county cricket can sometimes be the same thing every day here everyone wants to win they have aims
5051699 for me its a very good level and there are things i can learn and take back to england and the county championship with warwickshire
5051700 you cant take anything lightly everyones fighting for places and everyones fighting to get ready to go
5051701 by the very nature of that it will be a proper game what i know about scotland is that when they played against sussex they were always massively up for the game so you have to be up for the game as well
5051702 were trying to set trends for how we go about our cricket kevin pietersen has said he wants everybody up for it every time they play a game for england so that will be no different on monday
5051703 warning the location you selected is not maintained by the city of grand rapids instead it falls within the jurisdiction of kent county road commission if you continue with the request it will be forwarded to the correct organization for handling by them
5051704 there is still a giant pothole at this location and it is getting bigger for a time there were some cones placed around it but people appear to have just run them over i first reported this on july 25th if its not fixed within 30 days the city can be held liable for any damages it causes please take care of this dangerous hazard on one of the citys busier roads thanks a lot
5051705 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5051706 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5051707 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5051708 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5051709 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5051710 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5051711 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5051712 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5051713 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5051714 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5051715 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5051716 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
5051717 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
5051718 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
5051719 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
5051720 conventional politician who always takes the safe and easy political road then amplify the distinction by framing mccain as a patriot somebody who has put sacrifice above self
5051721 all the girls are gorgeous and its brilliant to even be up there competing with girls who have been in the business a lot longer than me but me a relative nobody came fourth this year which is pretty damn good now i want to do even better and maybe knock one out of the way

5051725 all of the partners and friends of deca including the dayton board of education understand that an experimental school needs stability time and adequate funding to demonstrate that an accelerated personalized approach to educating urban students can be successful
5051726 recognizes that deca has operated very successfully as a district education pilot school and that budget cuts will significantly negatively impact decas success
5051727 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
5051728 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5051729 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
5051730 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
5051731 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
5051732 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
5051733 wasnt a personal trip over there to go to caesars palace and play
5051734 he believes it was the right thing to do and on the spur of the moment he just went

5051736 daddy i want to be called xontar the andromeda galaxys prince of pounding
5051737 remember howie epstein including his earliest recordings early tracks volume 1 which have just been released
5051738 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5051739 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5051740 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5051741 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5051742 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5051743 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5051744 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5051745 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5051746 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5051747 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5051748 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5051749 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5051750 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5051751 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5051752 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5051753 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5051754 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget

5051762 make vows to the lord your god and fulfill them
5051763 if god will be with me and will watch over me on this journey i am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear so that i return safely to my fathers house then the lord will be my god and this stone that i have set up as a pillar will be gods house and of all that you give me i will give you a tenth
5051764 i am the god of bethel where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me now leave this land at once and go back to your native land
5051765 when my life was ebbing away i remembered you lord and my prayer rose to you to your holy temple those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs but i with a song of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you what i have vowed i will make good salvation comes from the lord and the lord commanded the fish and it vomited jonah onto dry land
5051766 speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazarite to separate themselves unto the lord

5051769 i didnt want to go here my grandmother made me i was getting good grades i was getting as and bs but i wasnt really learning
5051770 there was a real question about whether adairia could be a good representative for deca in this program
5051771 there were kids getting their drivers licenses and driving up in these big cars and there was one girl she just didnt get her drivers license she got her pilots license
5051772 i found out that theres nothing to hold me back no one who will hold me back except for me
5051773 i learned that you have to build up your network its all about learning that you need other people you cant achieve your goals on your own
5051774 i actually think it will be easier than going to deca and taking classes at sinclair and ud

5051785 the partners at johnnys acknowledged from the beginning they wanted to tie up the space if it was to be vacated to ensure another burger hot dog place didnt move in next door
5051786 i dont want another store restaurant selling something similar setting up shop next door and take those evil street venders and confine them in some woebegotten corner of downtown where they cant interfere with my business
5051787 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet

5051793 there is a lot of fuss being made over these reports that i have already made up my mind to retire i will go home and make my decision about what to do retiring is a possibility but i need time to think it over
5051794 we all really wanted to stand on the podium together and see the japanese flag raised
5051795 in the individual events its just me but in this one we all had to put our strength together
5051796 its been a hard and painful training process for me but i just kept my head down and did my weightlifting and training
5051797 to get second is great but three in a row would have been nice
5051798 i certainly have no regrets with my preparation and what ive been able to do here
5051799 ive come a long way in my swimming since world championships 18 months ago
5051800 ive been doing it for a long long time and its tough to stay there
5051801 he did a great effort good on him for winning he was the better competitor on the blocks tonight
5051802 ive been waiting for this moment for two years i had expectations for the 400 freestyle but this is a great surprise
5051803 im going to celebrate this appropriately its been two years since i havent gone back to my hometown im going to see my dad my friends my brothers and sisters
5051804 i felt good in the first 400 at 800 and 900 i started believing i could win
5051805 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100 to save energy and attack in the final 50
5051806 im happy for ous if it wasnt an american winning it then i would want him to win it
5051807 hes a great friend of mine and a great competitor hes as tough as nails
5051808 the gold medal will more than make up for his setbacks hes been training with a vengeance over the past year since that hiccup about a year or two ago and hes proven it every day in work out
5051809 im not going to decide now ill see what i feel like have a break then see what happens
5051810 i wanted to race and i got the best out of myself and they got the best of me
5051811 the only reason she could do this is shes never been out of shape a day in her life she loves to train and be fit
5051812 i did this in sydney but i was 33 then
5051813 shes a model for me i must learn from her
5051814 if it helps anyone else out there who is in their middle aged years and they put off something they thought they couldnt do because they were too old or maybe thought that because they have children they cant balance what they want to do and be a parent then im absolutely thrilled
5051815 shes really taken the age factor out of the sport
5051816 i realized i shouldnt have filed by nails last night
5051817 he and i wrote the story together and unfortunately he couldnt be here to finish it with me
5051818 and i have a list of school supplies i have to get her
5051819 it uses a minimum number of buttons to control a minimal set of player actions with the depth derived not from the number of those actions but from how when and where theyre deployed because it has simple controls and simple visuals its portable to platforms including next gen consoles pcs and handhelds because its nonviolent and easy to learn but deep and rewarding its accessible to a very broad audience women children and non gamers should be able to enjoy it as much as hard core gamers because it has no campaign no story and a limited set of features and content it can be completed in 12 months
5051820 these are delicious i really must do this more often
5051821 this seemingly nonsensical digression about pineapples is actually a lead in to something relevant

5051826 its looking like snow close to sea level in the east of the south island for christchurch and thatll be more the evening and overnight but dunedin and otago will probably be getting close to that during the day
5051827 its just one burst so conditions will improve from the south early tuesday
5051828 clear skies on wednesday means itll be pretty icy with snow on the ground
5051829 we are strongly advising people not to go on tracks in nelson lakes national park and that includes lakeside tracks due to the avalanche risk the weather conditions and risk of tree fall due to snow
5051830 i thought i was in the perfect position with 250m to go right behind arturo casado the spaniard but then he actually ran out of steam with 200m to go and everyone went by
5051831 i was like how do i get out of this position its sort of like pulling out in traffic to pass when someone else is coming youve got to check your rear view mirror otherwise youll get a blind spot
5051832 you lose your stride its like getting up from an ankle tap just getting your foot in front of you you lose your momentum and youve got to really regather your speed
5051833 i dont know whether its unsportsmanlike or not but for the first lap i was yelling at them come on guys pick up the pace weve got a chance to get seven guys through in this heat thats how pedestrian it was

5051845 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5051846 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5051847 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
5051848 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials

5051851 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family

5051853 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5051854 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible

5051858 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5051859 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5051860 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5051861 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5051862 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5051863 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
5051864 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
5051865 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey

5051874 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5051875 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5051876 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5051877 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5051878 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5051879 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5051880 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5051881 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5051882 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5051883 i feel that her hands call me again and again

5051885 i want to make a name for myself in this profession

5051894 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5051895 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins
5051896 the most important element is if theyre really taking it seriously or if theyre just paying lip service
5051897 thats our goal though is to change with the times
5051898 another few weary steps and there was nothing above us but the sky
5051899 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5051900 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5051901 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5051902 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5051903 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5051904 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5051905 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5051906 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5051907 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5051908 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5051909 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing
5051910 most of my friends thought i was a lot cooler i guess
5051911 it would kind of just be nice to be a regular person again
5051912 you plow ahead and make a hit and you plow on and someone passes you then someone passes them time levels
5051913 when you think of life as a living active process i dont think its a pleasurable activity unless you have some challenge in that life no matter what it is
5051914 i think in a way that is the philosophy of life
5051915 when im with a group of kids now they just yell out thats the cooking man
5051916 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5051917 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5051918 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up
5051919 it will be a landmark by election it will be a deciding factor for anwar
5051920 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
5051921 it is a historic moment for malaysians especially the silent majority to convey how they want the nation to move ahead
5051922 that is what he is crying for we cannot ignore that
5051923 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5051924 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5051925 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5051926 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5051927 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5051928 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5051929 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5051930 we get to talk to people from all over the world they actually go crazy when they see us
5051931 they cant believe this is happening in america that in a big city like fort worth theres a cowboy walking down the street or on the back of a horse
5051932 they have to stick together thats the main thing with the cattle drives
5051933 if we was trying to take two head down the street they would probably run off on us but if we take them all or eight to 10 at least theyll all stick together
5051934 where else can you go to sit on a horse and look cool all day
5051935 you get to meet and greet all kinds of people from all over the world you definitely dont have a boring day here
5051936 h den personen er s utrolig teit m tte h n bare d
5051937 this time im bringing a few million friends not sure the etiquette on that perhaps a fruit basket which makes a lovely gift
5051938 our freedom is curtailed no less by an act of arbitrary judicial power as it is by an act of an arbitrary executive or legislative or state power
5051939 judicial appointees will understand that it is not their role to usurp the rightful functions and powers of the co equal political branches i will look for candidates who respect the lawmaking powers of congress and the powers of the president
5051940 i think that presidents have the obligation to obey and enforce laws that are passed by congress and signed into law by the president no matter what the situation is
5051941 i dont think the president has the right to disobey any law
5051942 were going to make every aspect of government purchases and performance transparent information on every step of contracts and grants will be posted on the internet in plain and simple english were not going to hide anything behind accounting tricks and bureaucratic doubletalk that a linguist with a phd in accounting couldnt decipher
5051943 why not come to congress we can sort this all out i dont think i know of no member of congress frankly who if the administration came and said heres why we need this capability that they wouldnt get it and so lets have the hearings
5051944 america must be a model citizen if we want others to look to us as a model how we behave at home affects how we are perceived abroad we must fight the terrorists and at the same time defend the rights that are the foundation of our society
5051945 it is shameful and dangerous that senate democrats are blocking an extension of surveillance powers that enable our intelligence and law enforcement to defend our country against radical islamic extremists
5051946 like all other nations we reserve the sovereign right to defend our vital national security when and how we deem necessary
5051947 government in this country is not based on the whims of one person the government is of the people by the people and for the people
5051948 the biggest problems that were facing right now have to do with george bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through congress at all and thats what i intend to reverse when im president of the united states of america
5051949 we face real threats any president needs the latitude to confront them swiftly and surely
5051950 turn the page on a growing empire of classified information and restore the balance weve lost between the necessarily secret and the necessity of openness in a democratic society well protect sources and methods but we wont use sources and methods as pretexts to hide the truth
5051951 i want you to review every executive order thats been issued by george bush whether it relates to warrantless wiretaps or detaining people or reading e mails or whatever it is i want you to go through every single one of them and if they are unconstitutional if theyre encroaching on civil liberties unnecessarily we are going to overturn them
5051952 a supreme court that is not just giving the president a blank check for whatever executive power grab he or she is engaging in
5051953 a standing bipartisan consultative group of congressional leaders on national security i will meet with this consultative group every month and consult with them before taking major military action
5051954 congress rubber stamped the rush to war giving the president the broad and open ended authority he uses to this day with that vote congress became co author of a catastrophic war
5051955 ultimately the president is the commander in chief the only way to force the presidents hand would be in some ways to restrict funding for the war effort in iraq that is not something that i am prepared to do
5051956 we must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist
5051957 rigid 20th century ideology that insisted that the 21st centurys stateless terrorism could be defeated through the invasion and occupation of a state
5051958 i will not hesitate to use military force to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to america and this requires a broader set of capabilities as outlined in the army and marine corps new counter insurgency manual
5051959 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5051960 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5051961 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5051962 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5051963 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5051964 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5051965 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5051966 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5051967 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5051968 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5051969 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5051970 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5051971 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5051972 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5051973 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5051974 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify

5051976 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5051977 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5051978 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5051979 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5051980 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5051981 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5051982 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5051983 food and fuel prices send inflation to new high as city fears interest rate increase
5051984 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5051985 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5051986 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5051987 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5051988 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5051989 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5051990 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5051991 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5051992 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5051993 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5051994 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5051995 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5051996 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5051997 who are open to doing something on the production side
5051998 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5051999 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5052000 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5052001 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5052002 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5052003 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5052004 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5052005 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5052006 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5052007 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5052008 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5052009 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5052010 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5052011 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5052012 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5052013 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5052014 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5052015 congratulations to our fine navy men which came in second this year having lost only one game it is unfortunate that the army men made such a poor showing finishing next to last having won only one game the entire season we hope they will have better luck next year
5052016 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5052017 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5052018 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5052019 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5052020 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5052021 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5052022 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5052023 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5052024 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5052025 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5052026 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5052027 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5052028 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5052029 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5052030 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5052031 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5052032 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5052033 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5052034 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5052035 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5052053 based on a ruling like this according to this court we live in baghdad
5052054 in the united states of america you can be prevented from earning a living because some judge says so slaten said
5052055 this judge needs to recuse himself from any other proceedings in this case slaten said
5052056 he obviously has a dislike for me none of what he wrote is supported by any of the testimony i defy him to show me the testimony that supports what he concluded the testimony is 100 percent to the opposite

5052059 s o cursos muito disputados no vestibular o n vel de quem entra muito alto independentemente das cotas e por isso durante a faculdade as notas s o muito parecidas
5052060 esse empate ocorre em um ter o dos 62 departamentos da unb
5052061 nas exatas o aluno precisa de base forte em matem tica e f sica essa base ainda fraca nas escolas p blicas de onde vem a maioria de quem entra pelas cotas
5052062 j nos cursos de humanas os alunos cotistas podem usar sua experi ncia social e cultural para obter um bom rendimento acad mico
5052063 no meu trabalho tentei mostrar que n o basta criar o programa de cotas para a entrada na universidade
5052064 os dirigentes da unb precisam dar mais aten o a esses estudantes depois que eles entram justamente para ajudar os que t m as notas menores e sofrem pela falta de base no ensino fundamental
5052065 eu ralo muito sempre estudei em col gio p blico era bom aluno mas j nas primeiras semanas de unb percebi que eu estava muito distante dos meus colegas meus h bitos de estudos eram fracos me faltava disciplina estou tentando me adaptar
5052066 meus pais n o t m curso superior sou uma exce o aqui dentro n o s na cor em tudo
5052067 isso tudo influencia acho que a universidade deveria ter um programa de refor o acad mico para n s cotistas s vezes a reitoria manda umas cartinhas mas s isso
5052068 estamos tentando reestrutur lo antes ele era ligado ao gabinete do reitor agora queremos vincul lo ao decanato de gradua o
5052069 o programa de cotas n o pode ser uma j ia pol tica do reitor tem que ter finalidades acad micas
5052070 as diferen as n o s o t o grandes como na engenharia mas mostram que o estudante de cota pode se superar quando tem a chance de entrar na universidade
5052071 isso bom democratiza a universidade e investe num valor que vai al m da competi o
5052072 fiquei com medo de ser reprovado mais uma vez e me inscrevi como cotista sou negro mas n o sou pobre moro no plano piloto e sempre estudei em col gio particular
5052073 quero ser diplomata n o estou com dificuldades na faculdade
5052074 ineg vel que o programa tem seus m ritos mas mesmo assim eu discordo das cotas s est entrando uma elite negra na universidade o que desperta uma rivalidade racial dentro do c mpus
5052075 acho muito mais interessante um programa que beneficie os alunos das escolas p blicas independentemente de suas ra as
5052076 l gico que tamb m seria interessante se tiv ssemos cotas para os col gios p blicos mas n o podemos descartar o que j conquistamos em mat ria de democratiza o do acesso com as cotas raciais elas melhoraram a universidade
5052077 mas no geral os dados mostram que as cotas correspondem a uma corre o necess ria para melhorar o acesso universidade por m seus resultados s o muito pequenos para corrigir as desigualdades sociais e raciais do pa s
5052078 sou de cota mas sou bom sou bom porque tive uma educa o fundamental boa isso uma exce o para os cotistas mas n o um problema dos cotistas um problema do brasil

5052096 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5052097 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5052098 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5052099 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5052100 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5052101 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5052102 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5052103 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5052104 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5052105 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5052106 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5052107 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5052108 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5052109 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5052110 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5052111 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5052112 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5052113 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5052114 theres a combination of reality and voyeurism that captures the imagination
5052115 if katie was this entertaining when she was actually on the air i might even watch her little newscast
5052116 its nice to be on harry shearer im gonna get you
5052117 one of my favorite people of all time is ms ellen degeneres
5052118 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5052119 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5052120 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5052121 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5052122 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5052123 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5052124 it will be a landmark by election it will be a deciding factor for anwar
5052125 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
5052126 it is a historic moment for malaysians especially the silent majority to convey how they want the nation to move ahead
5052127 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5052128 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5052129 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5052130 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5052131 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5052132 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5052133 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5052134 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5052135 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5052136 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5052137 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5052138 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5052139 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5052140 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5052141 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5052144 mit ein bisschen mehr routine werde ich bald auch auf asphalt um spitzenpl tze k mpfen k nnen die beiden fahrer vor mir lagen aber au er reichweite
5052145 in einer kurve h tte es uns fast erwischt in unserem gebetbuch stand leicht cutten doch ich habe heftig gecuttet dabei h tte es das auto fast ausgehebelt wir sind bei hohem tempo ziemlich lang auf zwei r dern gefahren auf der vorletzten pr fung habe ich dann gesehen dass wir fran ois nicht mehr einholen k nnen und habe platz vier sicher nach hause gebracht
5052146 wir sind gut gestartet und das auto f hlte tadellos gut an doch die zweite und dritte etappe waren alptr ume immerhin konnte ich weitere erfahrung auf asphalt sammeln au erdem zeigte mir diese rallye wie wichtig die mentale vorbereitung ist daran werde ich nun auch im hinblick auf die rallye neuseeland arbeiten und ich werde vor der n chsten asphalt rallye im oktober in spanien noch intensiv auf diesem untergrund trainieren
5052147 wir starteten gut in die rallye besonders mikko zeigte am freitag eine unglaubliche leistung aber mangelnde asphalt erfahrung sowie die st ndig wechselnden stra enbel ge dieser schwierigsten aller asphalt rallyes verhinderten eine gr ere punkteausbeute immerhin haben die fahrer hier viel gelernt was ihnen bei den noch kommenden zwei l ufen auf diesem untergrund zugute kommen wird
5052148 wir haben hier die f hrung in der marken wm abgegeben doch in zwei wochen werden die karten wieder neu gemischt die neuseel ndischen schotterwege liegen unseren fahrern besser unser ziel lautet die wm f hrung umgehend zur ckzuerobern

5052165 will continue to do work with them and support their networks
5052166 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get them to write a sequel but they really didn t want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that and so an answer to that was to do a crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesn t make sense at all but could work
5052167 even texas oil man boone pickens boone is not a democrat whos calling for major new investments in alternative energy has said this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
5052168 senator how does it feel meeting with someone who tore down your democratic colleague in the last election
5052169 you know he has a lot longer track record than that he has been doing he is you know a legendary entrepreneur and there are a lot of things that i think we have to unify the country around it is having an intelligent energy policy everybody knows if we keep on going on the same track that we are going that we are giving our wealth away we are funding both sides of the war on terror we are going to be over the long term putting enormous pressure on ordinary families here in america who just arent going to be able to afford you know skyrocketing gasoline prices and home heating prices so this is one of those issues that i think should unify the country and that is what we are going to be talking about
5052170 a non partisan campaign and that i will do everything in my power to work together with leaders who are willing to solve our immense energy problems which are ruining our economy and threatening our national security
5052171 it would be inappropriate for me to speak for senator obama i have a real sense however that he was very engaged he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people of this great nation as with any leader he knows that developing real energy policy that will transform america for the better requires change and that change happens not just from the top down but from the bottom up and thats what we are doing with the pickens plan

5052175 senator mccain and the republicans mock democratic candidate for president barack obama for suggesting that the country conserve gas through proper tire inflation not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity

5052178 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
5052179 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
5052180 what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved
5052181 and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness
5052182 nobody can deny the force or the power of the source
5052183 but is it the same as it was five years ago no it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to

5052216 further programme of the coordination committee would be announced at eidgah grounds on friday
5052217 all vehicles private or public would move during these three days displaying black flags shops would remain open and go about their businesses as usual but each shop would display a black flag and office goers must wear black bands around their arms during duty hours as a mark of protest against the recent killings of unarmed civilians by the state forces

5052221 we have many options to continue our protests but we would better not disclose them
5052222 it could be but right now there is no blockade if we really do the whole world will come to know
5052223 if police continue to use excessive force then it will be difficult for people like me to continue in parliament

5052231 no estoy en condiciones de mencionar o de escribir con precisi n qu es lo que se va a hacer al respecto
5052232 nada ten a que ver con la actuaci n del rbitro
5052233 antiguamente hab a el estigma de que hueso expuesto era igual a amputaci n con esta t cnica demostramos que eso se puede revertir lo que nos enorgullece es que m xico es el primer lugar de am rica latina en que se hace este procedimiento
5052234 tradicionalmente se amputaba en hasta 90 por ciento de los casos ahora las amputaciones se han reducido por lo menos en esta unidad del imss a dos por ciento

5052248 the administration absolutely was telling him not to provoke the russians and to resolve the dispute peacefully
5052249 and then just a month ago you had secretary rice in tbilisi standing next to saakashvili saying in response to a question from him
5052250 and its clear that she had something else in mind she was talking about the dispute with our allies over joining nato but this very open ended statement on her part i think cannot but have created some opportunities for misunderstanding let me put it that way
5052251 well i want to go back to the question about american the american voice here i think hes absolutely right america wasnt speaking with a single clear voice
5052252 we had lower level state department officials giving a correct message but it was confused and it was overridden by a louder voice from washington that came particularly from the neocon community i think we see tragic consequences from that
5052253 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used

5052257 desarmar a la generalitat valenciana que ha abierto una grieta en el frente cl sico
5052258 pondr a a catalunya en una situaci n l mite pero muy clarificadora
5052259 ha pagado muy caro pactar con zapatero de espaldas a catalunya
5052260 el psc fue quien inici el proceso de ruptura del frente para el estatut
5052261 espero que la actitud del presidente de la generalitat jos montilla primer secretario del psc sea la misma actitud del conseller de econom a
5052262 lo que ser a terrible continu es que el psc se supeditara a los intereses del psoe y de hecho el psoe lo intenta forzando reuniones de barones para convencer al presidente de la generalitat pero no le ha salido bien
5052263 obliga a pasar por el consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera cpff
5052264 dentro del modelo del estado espa ol no hay m s soluci n para catalunya que el concierto econ mico que es el nico instrumento que nos permitir a una negociaci n en condiciones de igualdad y equidad con el estado
5052265 el nico mecanismo que entender a el estado para negociar con equidad y paridad es que catalunya recaptara todos los impuestos como pasa con el sistema foral navarro y vasco
5052266 en catalunya hay una imposici n unilateral por parte del gobierno y nosotros como mucho podemos oponernos
5052267 referencia de lo que es un buen acuerdo y lo que es un mal acuerdo
5052268 puede haber un acuerdo de todas las ccaa menos cartalunya podr a pasar
5052269 ni erc ni el govern podr n aceptar un mal modelo
5052270 el govern tendr muchas dificultades que van m s all de si hay o no elecciones anticipadas
5052271 ser n dificultades para este govern o el que venga
5052272 mucho me temo que jos luis rodr guez zapatero les llevar a este l mite
5052273 el psoe no considera que el psc sea de los suyos los suyos son los que cuando el psoe manda y ordena al psn en navarra que regale el gobierno a la derecha obedecen
5052274 cuando el psoe le dice al psc que la presidencia debe ser para artur mas y el psc dice que no dejan de ser los suyos
5052275 los suyos argument son los que cuando lanzan exabruptos contra catalunya desde la junta de extremadura de andaluc a o de galicia nadie desde madrid les contesta los que no son suyos son los que cuando alguien pide un m nimo de equidad para catalunya autom ticamente se les llama al orden para el psoe hay diferentes categor as una divisi n de honor en la que juegan andaluc a extremadura y galicia y hay una segunda divisi n donde juega catalunya
5052276 el gobierno de zapatero s lo ha tenido una intenci n clara la de erosionar al govern de catalunya que naci en contra de su voluntad
5052277 la financiaci n que se deriva del estatut tampoco es justa pero somos dem cratas y el pueblo de catalunya decidi avalar este estatut
5052278 el bloqueo del modelo es absoluto falla el sistema pol tico espa ol

5052281 ponen de manifiesto la evoluci n que ha experimentado la comunidad valenciana en el consumo de combustibles f siles durante los ltimos a os
5052282 buena parte del aumento en el consumo del gas natural se debe a la sustituci n de productos petrol feros por gas natural una fuente mucho m s limpia
5052283 junto a las ventajas derivadas de la utilizaci n de un combustible m s limpio como el gas natural hay que a adir las ventajas derivadas de la propia tecnolog a utilizada y el rendimiento
5052284 las proporciones de contaminaci n emitidas finalmente son a n menores
5052285 se est haciendo un gran esfuerzo para impulsar las infraestructuras necesarias para fomentar la utilizaci n de este combustible y garantizar el suministro de gas en la comunidad valenciana
5052286 un factor clave para mejorar la competitividad de la industria valenciana mejorando la estructura de costes de las empresas y contribuyendo a la preservaci n del medio ambiente al utilizar una fuente de energ a menos contaminante
5052287 la paulatina sustituci n de los productos petrol feros por el gas natural ha sido posible gracias a la extensi n de los ramales de gasoducto que han permitido que este combustible llegue a numerosas poblaciones
5052288 por la decisi n de la empresa de que la totalidad de las pel culas y la gran mayor a de series sean en castellano
5052289 la reducci n de la capacidad de obtener ingresos por venta de producto propio
5052290 alto porcentaje de emisi n de programas repetidos tanto ajenos como ajenos

5052299 although we seem to be separate individuals in reality we are all expressions of one primal imagination we assume we are many but in fact we are one and what we do to each other we do to ourselves
5052300 the reason your monastery has languished is that the buddha is living among you in disguise and you have not honored him
5052301 let us first be as simple and well as nature ourselves
5052302 please dont show me love im unable to receive it
5052303 harry consists of a hundred or a thousand selves not of two his life oscillates as everyones does not merely between two poles such as the body and the spirit the saint and the sinner but between thousands and thousands every ego so far from being a unity is in the highest degree a manifold world a constellated heaven a chaos of forms of states and stages of inheritances and potentialities as a body everyone is single as a soul never
5052304 generate their own good fortune via four basic principles they are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition create self fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good
5052305 sri lanka is one of the toughest places to play cricket as you dont get a lot of runs on slow low wickets you have to always stay positive
5052306 obviously i have to face a better attack when i play the odi but my innings was against an international side with mendis and muralitharan sri lanka will have a potent attack
5052307 if the swelling in his ankle subsides why not play him
5052308 it is difficult to make out from the video footages about his bowling the more you play the more comfortable you will get
5052309 you have to take chances against him in the sense you got to make sure when he bowls a loose delivery you get the most out of it so that you can put pressure on the bowler of course inputs from sehwag and gambhir they would really help
5052310 in any form of cricket whether in test cricket or one dayers the start is very important but it does not mean the entire pressure is on the openers to always give you a good start sehwag is sort of a player who takes a bit of risk
5052311 of course it is crucial he is in a very good nick he and gautam gambhir have played well in the test series also of course they will have some added responsibility but no real pressure
5052312 we are playing with five bowlers most likely it would be a three to two combination because you hardly play with a 4 1 combination we will look at the wicket and decide
5052313 i have never thought of it we will look to play five bowlers we have not decided on that we are looking for a six and five combination
5052314 therefore trying to restrict them will be a good option they will commit mistakes the entire responsibility comes on players like kumar sangakkara mahela jayawardene
5052315 all these players they are completely different from each other some one like jayasuriya it is important to get them out
5052316 we have players who have played in 200 match and 150 matches some have also played 300 matches but we have a fair amount of experience with some players having played more than 100 one dayers it is now on how the guys who have come up here perform and how they have adapted on the conditions
5052317 i have never really thought over it my journey from one to out of the ten spot and then coming back i have never thought about that for me what is important is winning games
5052318 n o teve mentira n o teve trai o n o teve nada

5052320 we have obtained the best possible help to assist us in the case as asif is adamant he is innocent
5052321 we are having the b sample test for the reconfirmation and we have to be present there inshallah i will be cleared
5052322 if i am cleared which i am confident i will be i will try to make a place for myself in the pakistan team as soon as possible
5052323 among two key recommendations that were made at the agm is to give boost to cricket in rural areas and provide more support to regional cricket centres
5052324 it is very hard to explain what a tumblelog is its more than a linkblog but contains less writing then a usual blog just look around on the site a bit and youll quickly figure it out
5052325 que ha funcionado perfectamente y gracias a su trabajo se han evitado da os
5052326 the important thing is we should also protect the player
5052327 if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club
5052328 im always in favour of protecting the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave
5052329 i think in football theres too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere
5052330 we are trying now to intervene in such cases the reaction to the bosman law is to make long lasting contacts in order to keep the players and then if he wants to leave then there is only one solution he has to pay his contract
5052331 living in madrid and playing for madrid theres not many better clubs than that apart from manchester united which is equal
5052332 we have asked him to pay the fine or it would not be possible for us to retain him in champions trophy squad
5052333 there is no court order saying he should not pay the fine even if the court upholds his petition against the ban and fine it will be refunded to him but he has to pay the fine now
5052334 but the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether pakistan could deliver on those plans
5052335 getting eight teams around to training and games in two centres is a massive logistical exercise and with the current situation there i dont know if the military could handle it
5052336 our guys listened patiently and asked some very pertinent questions i thought but i didnt get the impression that any of them were convinced about the safety of the situation
5052337 a call for people to be their best human selves
5052338 where are the new big ideas of the republican party that john mccain is is championing
5052339 i would appreciate a more technical view of golds valuation since it has some predictive power
5052340 there is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom expansion brought about by credit expansion the alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved
5052341 the final collapse of a boom expansion brought about by credit expansion
5052342 because we are headed for global slowdown with europe maybe worse off than the us were going to see inflation slow down too all the consumer belt tightening and economic malaise and so on will translate to falling prices which means no inflation fears and no need for gold
5052343 people are not buying cars and people are not buying houses and when that stops it travels backwards all the way back to the mine

5052346 we get to talk to people from all over the world they actually go crazy when they see us
5052347 they cant believe this is happening in america that in a big city like fort worth theres a cowboy walking down the street or on the back of a horse
5052348 they have to stick together thats the main thing with the cattle drives
5052349 if we was trying to take two head down the street they would probably run off on us but if we take them all or eight to 10 at least theyll all stick together
5052350 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5052351 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5052352 its a good way to attract families so that they can learn about you know small steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint
5052353 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors
5052354 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5052355 a lot of them used to just leave them running all night because it looks nice
5052356 the rides that come in when youre talking about the types and sizes of exhibit buildings that we have it is a massive undertaking
5052357 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool
5052358 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5052359 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins
5052360 the most important element is if theyre really taking it seriously or if theyre just paying lip service
5052361 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5052362 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5052363 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5052364 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5052365 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5052366 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5052367 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5052368 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5052369 that chronicles the writers path from undesired entrance into the neighborhood as a bu undergrad to her hesitant departure as a

5052384 if i had a nickel for every time that happens id be a millionaire
5052385 can we track everything you purchase ever and then sell your demographic information with specific purchasing frequency and habits to the highest bidder who will then resell that data to the highest bidder again
5052386 the biggest change is that i never get the girl anymore
5052387 i am the oldest person in the cast and sometimes i have to hobble to the set
5052388 it is a strange thing coming in and seeing all of the young secretaries and knowing that im the rudy vallee part
5052389 i go to table readings sometimes when im not in the show of the week just to hear it
5052390 and im not saying this to gloss it up it is astounding the way the direction of the show is going in the second season its unbelievable
5052391 we are sworn to secrecy and we have to burn our scripts
5052392 we cant talk to our wives and our loved ones or anybody about whats going on and we barely talk with one another about whats going on
5052393 im so grateful to be here with all of these people and at my age to be part of something that is absolutely magnificent
5052394 i know everybody talks about their tv show as being the best and all of that but i sincerely am very very profoundly lucky and thankful to be with all of these people and creator executive producer matt weiner and the writers and the actors
5052395 i even come to work when im not working because i dont belong to a senior club
5052396 so i feel this is my club and i come down to the set sometimes just to get the free lunch and to be here with all of these wonderful people and hope that ill be in next weeks show
5052397 there is no one who loves pain grief itself who seeks after it and wants to have it simply because it is pain grief
5052398 how come everybody goes to mamma mia huh i mean really seriously huh i hate abba theyre no good you know well everybody goes theyve been selling out for years
5052399 its definitely a reversal of the way things usually work usually the movies on time and eas late with the game
5052400 though ea is not to blame for this delay the negative impact will likely be the same nonetheless we doubt that ea will attempt to release the title without the movie
5052401 its definitely a reversal of the way things usually work usually the movies on time and eas late with the game
5052402 but ea has the game pretty much done and ready now the movies delayed
5052403 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5052404 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5052405 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5052406 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5052407 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5052408 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5052409 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5052410 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5052411 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5052412 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5052413 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5052414 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5052415 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5052416 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5052417 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5052418 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5052419 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5052420 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5052421 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5052422 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5052423 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5052424 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5052425 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5052426 from the technical point of view the engines of power plant 1 have to be shutdown at the soonest
5052427 they should also clean the surroundings of the engines of all combustible materials to prevent fire
5052428 in the camps we emphasize the need to unite and put an end to the internal struggles
5052429 why do you squint at the splinter in your brothers eye and fail to see the log in your own eye
5052430 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safe haven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5052431 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5052432 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5052433 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they militants would have known women and children were present
5052434 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5052435 mobile tv services have taken off in where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5052436 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off
5052437 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5052438 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5052439 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5052440 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5052441 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5052442 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5052443 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5052444 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5052445 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5052446 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5052447 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5052448 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5052449 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5052450 we are going to get back and look at things make our corrections and try to sharpen it all up there is no need to panic
5052451 how do i get content related to what my market wants quickly
5052452 we have found that consumers are becoming more educated and are looking beyond the megapixel when purchasing a digital camera
5052453 we have found that consumers are becoming more educated and are looking beyond the megapixel when purchasing a digital camera
5052454 the new finepix j150w takes easy to use digital technology to the next level and offers new features such as face detection with automatic red eye removal and a 28mm equivalent wide angle lens all with a 3
5052455 you were good enough to win this you know it just wasnt meant to be this time
5052456 i believe youre right but this is one of the first times i can walk away from a major event not having ended up where i wanted to and still happy in knowing that i gave it my best and though i was a little disappointed i wasnt devastated or even upset because my identity is not connected any longer to my performance in archery or my results but is found in christ i have an amazing peace and security
5052457 therefore the lord longs to be gracious to you and therefore he waits on high to have compassion on you
5052458 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site

5052470 today they played very well its important but more important is that the fans of chelsea saw a beautiful game

5052503 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5052504 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5052505 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5052506 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5052507 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5052508 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5052509 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5052510 we win the gold medal im speechless i cant very well say its the happiest day of my life because ive got married between athens and now this is a close second
5052511 hopefully there are more to come with canoeing starting and trampoline obviously were hoping there is a good momentum for more medals
5052512 i was proud of what i was able to achieve today
5052513 im ending my career doing my personal best at the olympic games and you couldnt ask for much more than that
5052514 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
5052515 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
5052516 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point
5052517 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
5052518 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and iain said go for it we committed everything we had and went
5052519 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint

5052532 you can always trust the devil or a politician to be the devil or a politician
5052533 in your view when does a baby get human rights
5052534 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5052535 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5052536 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5052537 now i know that russian troops are not welcome in georgia and should get out i dont need to be reminded that putin has blood on his hands
5052538 i absolutely endorse the position that serbs are not as guilty as nato portrays it

5052541 sus pilares son la confianza y la integridad consideradas como las virtudes cardinales y son extraordinariamente redituables demandando que el hombre viva a base de virtudes y no de vicios
5052542 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5052543 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5052544 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services

5052546 there is no balance in life if you mean 50 50 balance its more like 80 20 most weeks
5052547 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5052548 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5052549 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5052550 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5052551 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5052552 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5052553 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5052554 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good

5052565 a brand valuation helps the company to understand the potential of its various hotel brands and it could restructure its portfolio accordingly

5052590 i cannot tell you anything about the address of my new living quarters because i dont have any yet but i am negotiating with two lodgings about the rent and im sure ill take one of the two because i cant stay here any longer i need to move by next month it looks as if herr von auerhammer wrote to you and told you that i had a room already its true i really had found one but what a place it was fit for rats and mice but not for humans even at midday 12 noon you couldnt see the stairs without a lantern the room itself was like a closet to get to it you had to go through the kitchen and in the door of the room there was a tiny window they assured me they would put up a little curtain again otherwise they couldnt see a thing in the kitchen or in the next room frau auerhammer called the place a rats nest in one word it was frightful what a splendid apartment it would have made for someone like me who has all sorts of distinguished people visiting him
5052591 today our country is facing the danger of war and a new surge of slander that those who dont like russias historical choice are ready to raise
5052592 you know hes got a longer track record than that

5052613 many risks still hang over the credit markets including a slow but deliberate deterioration in fundamentals
5052614 there are legal and ethical problems to buying debt in your own companies
5052615 as long as a company does not run out of money you can keep it going for quite a while like that it can help to postpone bad news for your investors
5052616 we have set it up in such a way as to prevent us influencing indicuss investment decisions
5052617 people are pretty careful about these chinese walls they must be as these are really different pools of investors and it is important the market sees a distinction there
5052618 it is genuinely unclear whether a company can own its own debt
5052619 buying alliance boots debt at 90p in the pound and holding until maturity is pretty unexciting when most funds promise 20 per cent returns for their investors
5052620 it is not really an asset class that private equity should play in most investors are really quite unhappy about seeing it happen
5052621 what we are seeing now is a dislocation of credit markets in one direction just as there was a dislocation in the other direction last year and we took advantage of it both ways
5052622 if you can invest a few hundred million dollars in names of companies where you know them really well you think the money is good and you can achieve 20 per cent returns why wouldnt you
5052623 there is considerable investor interest in putting money into debt funds at the moment

5052661 psychologically people find it hard to retire when the market is down 20 percent
5052662 thats a self imposed discipline that retirees would be wise to adhere to

5052669 president bush is going to make history he will become the first sitting u s president to attend the olympics in a foreign country he said hes been looking forward to it ever since he heard that in china people are not allowed to make fun of political leaders
5052670 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
5052671 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
5052672 the challenge for obama lies in not having this convention come to closure with a clear message of unity and enthusiasm
5052673 but its not in either clintons best interest to come out of this convention leaving the suggestion that shes being a spoiler
5052674 she has to go through the motions and make those motions very convincing
5052675 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
5052676 hes trying to give credit to president clinton and senator clinton for their accomplishments in the 90s and in the primaries while turning the focus forward to the general election and the problems the us faces
5052677 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5052678 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5052679 russia overreached used disproportionate force against a small neighbour and is now paying the price
5052680 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5052681 serious consequences that a failure to quickly and fully implement the deal would have on relations between russia and the european union
5052682 the russian troops are starting to pull out and russian peacekeepers are coming in
5052683 we are here to protect the people and stop looting
5052684 all the roads are free for humanitarian aid and georgians

5052686 convene again just to deal with the situation in zimbabwe
5052687 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
5052688 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5052689 we are on a clear road towards nato membership for georgia
5052690 i am looking forward to the speedy withdrawal of russian troops which has not yet happened as we had expected
5052691 to show that we support the georgian people and also the government to deal with the work there is to do
5052692 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
5052693 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the commonwealth of independent states cis
5052694 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5052695 you know hes got a longer track record than that

5052700 we require that all our full time staff missionaries commit themselves to at least 50 hours per week of dedicated service this includes helping to lead prayer and worship meetings training missionaries and leaders evangelism outreach to the poor administration of the missions base etc our missionaries maintain a rigorous prayer life with regular fasting as they serve the poor sick and needy in our outreaches
5052701 by definition therefore cultic mind control is a process of either unconscious or intentional change of an individuals behavior thought and emotional patterns through subtle deceptive and damaging means by unethical spiritual leaders who hold positions of trust and authority over them it involves a process whereby an individuals means of independent thought is effectively controlled and even overcome by degrees and an entirely different mode of thinking is adopted by them which is supplied by these leaders it is this kind of power that leads men and women in cultic groups to accept as normal various kinds of abuse outrages and privation that those outside the groups would recognize immediately for what it is

5052704 we invaded iraq without justification we have no standing to object if russia does the same to georgia

5052755 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
5052756 weve been living in florida now for 10 years so we need to get some stuff together but were not going to rush out of here
5052757 weve got to get back and buckle up our own house
5052758 we get to talk to people from all over the world they actually go crazy when they see us
5052759 they cant believe this is happening in america that in a big city like fort worth theres a cowboy walking down the street or on the back of a horse
5052760 they have to stick together thats the main thing with the cattle drives
5052761 if we was trying to take two head down the street they would probably run off on us but if we take them all or eight to 10 at least theyll all stick together
5052762 one of these things dont belong together one of these things just arent the same
5052763 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5052764 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5052765 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5052766 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5052767 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5052768 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5052769 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5052770 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5052771 remains a phone call away in supporting the mantle of technobabble carried by mckay and his science team
5052772 toward the end of the season i really didnt have much so it was nice to be brought back and i really appreciate that from the producers that they bring me back whenever they can
5052773 sometimes its just so automatic that i forget that im supposed to have an accent as this character
5052774 so theres been times where im talking and they are rolling and i start to speak and i go gah so in some ways its almost been harder to remember that i have to speak with an accent which is the most basic sort of thing
5052775 i love the scripts that are coming out its interesting the character development is really strong and evolving its going in a good direction i love being here i love this job
5052776 its a good way to attract families so that they can learn about you know small steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint
5052777 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors
5052778 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5052779 a lot of them used to just leave them running all night because it looks nice
5052780 the rides that come in when youre talking about the types and sizes of exhibit buildings that we have it is a massive undertaking
5052781 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool
5052782 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5052783 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins
5052784 the most important element is if theyre really taking it seriously or if theyre just paying lip service

5052787 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5052788 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5052789 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5052790 what they need most is a dwelling to live in i hope the government will give them an apartment
5052791 with the help of allah they will make it but i think it will be difficult
5052792 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand and we spent 15 000 a second in cost
5052793 we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
5052794 it was there from the first lap the first turn
5052795 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
5052796 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5052797 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5052798 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5052799 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5052800 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5052801 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5052802 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5052803 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5052804 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5052805 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5052806 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5052807 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5052808 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5052809 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5052810 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5052811 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5052812 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5052813 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5052814 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5052815 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5052816 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5052817 hmm i want to do this oh right there was a note on railsenvy about that
5052818 very grateful for all the letters of support and wishes during the term of ronnies illness
5052819 he wants to write his own tunes instead of ruining everyone elses
5052820 mark ronson needs to learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune
5052821 the monkees havent split up theyre just going under the name of the kaiser chiefs
5052822 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
5052823 anybody whose drummer writes the songs are not to be trusted
5052824 god almighty i have respect for sir bob stamp on her though
5052825 noel gallagher was very clearly briefed in advance and monitored during the live interview
5052826 as ever noel was a lively and opinionated guest of course radio one does not condone drug abuse and if we felt our guest was drunk we would not put him on air
5052827 most people have a notion that elderly people have very weak immunity or they have lost immunity
5052828 this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5052829 its important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus that has implications for new pandemic viruses
5052830 the elderly might be a very good donor source for finding antibodies against viruses
5052831 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5052832 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along
5052833 the implication of this study is the 1918 virus was so powerful that the immunity you had to have in order to survive was so prominent that it lasted for the rest of your life
5052834 so those in certain age groups who had seen a related virus had the strongest responses
5052835 either they died or they developed a profound immune response
5052836 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5052837 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5052838 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5052839 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5052840 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5052841 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5052842 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5052843 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5052844 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5052845 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5052846 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5052847 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5052848 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5052849 i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank after bob and i both grab a little break itll be time to start depositing

5052858 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5052859 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5052860 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5052861 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5052862 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5052863 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5052864 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5052866 to be a christian is to grow up into christ in all things it is to have that divine seed which was planted in our innermost spirit blossom out into a growing conformity to his perfect life to be a christian is to have christ the life of our minds our hearts our will so that it is christ thinking through us living through us willing through us it is increasingly to have no life but the life of christ within us filling us with ever increasing measure

5052879 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
5052880 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
5052881 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand
5052882 such levels of productions are further down the road we think that in five years it is very possible that this drug could reach human clinical trials
5052883 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium
5052884 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5052885 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5052886 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5052887 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5052888 the second launch of the safir rocket carrying the first satellite omid was conducted successfully
5052889 the iranian media is mistaken it was the launch of a rocket capable of carrying a satellite the omid satellite was not launched itself
5052890 the achievement has drawn much attention from around the world especially from among muslim nations as iran is under heavy sanctions by the west and the making it develop the technology and build every part and equipment needed in the field of aerospace
5052891 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians

5052920 places americans as a distinct party to the circumstances in georgia
5052921 future russian action after we become present could endanger americans and that can be seen as a trip wire for further us action
5052922 it is not the intention of the united states in some way to take control of facilities port facilities or the like
5052923 thats way premature and hypothetical and speculative and nothing that i would comment on
5052924 well beyond the bounds of the conflict in south ossetia
5052925 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
5052926 oh hell that irritating mogambo idiot imi is off on a real tirade lets go get something to eat and drink and we wont give him any hahaha
5052927 in rome 277 bc the denarius was born it was a silver coin and for the first 250 years its silver content declined only modestly the modest decline corresponded with romes rise to become an empire from the original 66 grains of silver the value had only declined 10 to 60 grains by the time of julius caesar 49 bc but soon afterwards monetary tumult commenced in earnest
5052928 in 54 ad emperor nero started to inflate and debase the value of romes money nero took 14 3 of the silver out of the denarius coin and 11 of the gold out of the aureus coin replacing the precious metals with base metals
5052929 as rome continued on its moral political and monetary decline by 193 ad the denarius had only 26 grains of silver a 61 devaluation from the original 66 grains shortly thereafter romes denarius stopped being accepted in trade by the rest of the world by 268 the denarius was nothing but base metal with a thin silver coating
5052930 if we flash forward to the us in the 1960s we find that in one fell swoop all of the silver was taken out of our coins and replaced with base metals are we rome on steroids

5052938 i had a coffee with a guy a musician i cant say who in soho
5052939 there are a couple of things i entertain myself with at the minute but its borderline platonic right now
5052940 ive only done what most teenage girls have done fallen in love made some wrong decisions been treated badly by some people
5052941 the only reason you become strong is because of the things you experience in life love does fascinate me because im a bit of a control freak
5052942 but real love you cant choose it thats the weird thing about it it chooses you
5052943 i still meet boys all the time they are lovely gorgeous and funny they tick all the boxes but theres one thing that happens to define love and i dont know what it is until it happens
5052944 i join the people of guam in mourning the deaths of sgt brian leon guerrero and spc samson mora who were fatally injured in afghanistan
5052945 and one should bear in mind that there is nothing more difficult to execute nor more dubious of success nor more dangerous to administer than to introduce a new system of things for he who introduces it has all those who profit from the old system as his enemies and he has only lukewarm allies in all those who might profit from the new system this lukewarmness partly stems from fear of their adversaries who have the law on their side and partly from the skepticism of men who do not truly believe in new things unless they have actually had personal experience of them
5052946 70 said that they have experienced a decline in the quality of design drawings
5052947 nearly 60 say having subs complete the design increases miscommunications and delays
5052948 architects need to be held more responsible for completing a quality design that can be built without numerous change orders or requests for information
5052949 implying massive changes in his or her professional education and culture the
5052950 but architects in the next 20 years will simulate buildings this nuance presents the profession of architecture with its most incredible opportunity to define itself since architects stopped cutting cathedral stones 400 years ago and started drafting
5052951 the real question that architects should be asking of themselves and those supplying them with
5052952 why should i use a computer to draw a bunch of parallel lines when i should be able to use it to build a wall
5052953 why bother the builders will do it the way that they want regardless of what we draw it
5052954 why spend the time and effort there have been billions of buildings built without this technology

5053037 there are some things i still want to do to raise the bar a bit more in the world of swimming for me its still work in progress
5053038 im just so happy to put jamaica on the map no one expected me to win so there was no pressure
5053039 were all great athletes and im very excited about the tremendous achievement were very good athletes and this says a lot for our country
5053040 my coach and i we went to the coffee shop and we met the boy who won the 100m who gave me a bunch of flowers
5053041 he told me these flowers are transferable if i took them i must win gold and then pass them on to someone else
5053042 i feel bad that it didnt go well i gave it my all but i want to feel that i didnt let my family down he promised his mother after the athens final he would deliver gold in beijing i gave everything i had
5053043 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
5053044 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things especially here winning for me is unbelievable
5053045 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it will take a few days before i realize im olympic champion
5053046 but this is for sure the biggest moment in my career in my life i will never forget this moment
5053047 its a great goal i did it in athens and now i did it here
5053048 the olympics means really a lot to me so thats why im really happy im little bit sad about the match but all things considered im really happy

5053051 i would imagine nuclear power still emits far fewer greenhouse gases overall
5053052 there been an underinvestment in uranium mine development the past 20 years or so leading to some of the shortfalls we are seeing now
5053053 2 indian point guards test positive for cocaine are suspended
5053054 weve left it in the hands of transportation security administration the federal aviation administration and the reactor vendors who are building these plants to do what they think is right in this area and to me thats clearly not the answer
5053055 the consequences would be so catastrophic the world would be a different place the next day
5053056 ramzi yousef the convicted mastermind of the 1993 world trade center bombing encouraged followers in 1994 to strike such a plant officials say an fbi agent has testified in court that one of yousefs followers told him in 1995 of plans to blow up a nuclear plant and in 1999 the nrc acknowledged to congress that it had received a credible threat of a terrorist attack against a nuclear power facility
5053057 the nrc did not specifically contemplate attacks by aircraft such as boeing 757s and 767s and nuclear plants were not designed to withstand such crashes

5053064 money matters in reactor project debate financing rather than safety appears to be key factor in whether plans proceed
5053065 installed u s wind power capacity surged 45 in 2007 american wind energy association market report
5053066 then it would save coal plants from putting about 400 million tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere each year 400 million is only 7 of 6 billion u s co2 emissions however much of this nuclear capacity would displace solar energy efficiency technologies natural gas etc these technologies produce far less co2 than coal so the displacement would be much lower
5053067 building operations heating cooling ventilation hot water etc account for 43 of total annual us ghg emissions
5053068 76 of all the electricity produced at power plants in the us goes to operate buildings
5053069 co2 emissions will be higher for nuclear power than for coal
5053070 so although its not perfect i honestly dont see any other solution than nuclear energy and you neither propose one as well

5053072 then about two years ago a utility put the cost at 2600 then estimates started really climbing over the last two years estimates have increased all the way to 10 000 per kilowatt 5 7 fold what the projection was just a few years ago

5053118 one of the three samples came back and it was messed up inconclusive one came back as human and the other one came back that because where they took the sample which was from the intestines ok it came back possum so that may be possibly what this thing had eaten we dont know
5053119 it seems to be that way in the bigfoot world that there are a lot of people that may be little delusional and they may be a little jealous too

5053127 ganar en gu rico no es s lo ganar en gu rico ganar en aragua no es s lo ganar en aragua es ganarle al imperialismo porque los candidatos de la oposici n venezolana son los candidatos del imperialismo ellos no representan los intereses de los venezolanos sino los intereses del imperio

5053129 i dont have to wear a bikini to be a porn star
5053130 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5053131 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5053132 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5053133 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5053134 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5053135 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5053136 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5053137 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5053138 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5053139 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5053140 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5053141 we didnt because seconds before the number ten odonovan whos very good at this jumps into people and doesnt actually head it
5053142 he jumped into mick so its a foul before that
5053143 i thought we should have had that decision so we wouldnt be talking about the penalty to be honest with you
5053144 five times that could have happened because im sure that when you jump for the ball youre supposed to jump for the ball and not into the man which happened quite a lot
5053145 i thought mick and gary considering that were excellent they kept their temper well and when you talk about respect for the referee i know were not signing the charter but they did very well
5053146 hes had a chance to finish it but he didnt take it that happens every now and then but its an honest mistake but look at the equalising goal we thought that we could have done more about that and wont worry too much about scotts miss
5053147 we played well in the first half and their goalkeeper made several good saves to keep them in the match
5053148 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle which is swollen up badly hell be out for two to three weeks we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5053149 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5053150 newcastle were good on the counter attack and in obafemi martins and damien duff they have players with quality in these positions if you dont stop them they can be dangerous
5053151 we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a credible result for us
5053152 carlos tevez will be back for portsmouth and wayne rooney is getting his fitness back
5053153 we avoided all the rain yesterday only for that wed be in big trouble
5053154 if we can start on tuesday we should have no trouble as it is supposed to be good for the week we have fresh ground each day
5053155 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5053156 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5053157 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5053158 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says
5053159 im probably the only person in this town that does
5053160 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5053161 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5053162 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5053163 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5053164 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5053165 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5053166 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5053167 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5053168 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5053169 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5053170 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5053171 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5053172 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5053173 for the love of money is the root of all evil
5053174 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5053175 this is an issue that is not on the table
5053176 everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he was he kept to his word he took off the uniform theres now a democratic government in pakistan
5053177 the march to the office of u n will take place as per schedule tomorrow
5053178 we requested them to review their decision to mobilise masses in the city tomorrow
5053179 over one lakh people would court arrest in jammu from tomorrow until august 20 as part of a
5053180 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5053181 we are on a clear road towards nato membership for georgia
5053182 i am looking forward to the speedy withdrawal of russian troops which has not yet happened as we had expected
5053183 to show that we support the georgian people and also the government to deal with the work there is to do
5053184 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
5053185 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the commonwealth of independent states cis
5053186 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5053187 i think it is a basic human need of some people to have a connection with their devotional side you cant visit a temple everyday but at least you can do it over the phone

5053216 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safe haven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5053217 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5053218 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5053219 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they militants would have known women and children were present

5053229 just this past week we passed out of the us senate banking committee which is my committee a bill to call for divestment from iran as way of ratcheting up the pressure to ensure that they dont obtain a nuclear weapon
5053230 i am just so happy to put jamaica on the map no one expected me to win so there was no pressure
5053231 were all great athletes and im very excited about the tremendous achievement were very good athletes and this says a lot for our country
5053232 it will be all right it was just one of those days
5053233 we have been waiting for this a long time and so many jamaican athletes have come so close the guys should have done it too they had the speed
5053234 its wonderful to have a top three for jamaica its stunning
5053235 this victory boosts my confidence to win the 200 we will also do well in the 4x100 i believe we can beat the americans
5053236 it was incredibly close i tried my best gave my all im not frustrated at all
5053237 i wasnt thinking about jamaican speed ive seen them all year long they are very consistent 10 78 into a pretty strong headwind is pretty impressive

5053252 whenever you pray go into your room and shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret and you father who sees in secret will reward you
5053253 actually that word reward isnt very appropriate here someone whos praying in secret that is having actually reached a habit of contemplative prayer is not interested in reward i discovered in the aramaic bible that the word translated as reward really means blossom or flourish this suggests that silence is the seedbed in which the holy spirit places the mustard seed of divine love it takes root and grows and you blossom what is blossoming the growth of faith hope and love the virtues and especially the fruits of the spirit listed in the beattitudes and by paul in galatians 5 contemplative prayer is a process of activating the gifts that we received in baptism

5053338 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5053339 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5053340 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services

5053369 the pentagon had been studying possible targets in the same spring i e 1998 that the cia had been drawing up its secret plan to raid tarnack farm
5053370 leads to one person as well as one global terrorist organization
5053371 we have very good evidence of links between osama bin laden al qaeda operatives and what happened on september 11
5053372 proof had to be delivered that the september 11 terror attack came from abroad
5053373 i have seen absolutely powerful and incontrovertible evidence of his osama bin ladens link to the events of the 11th of september
5053374 there is no evidence presented in the dossier that directly links bin laden to september 11
5053375 there was no doubt of bin ladens responsibility for the september 11 attacks before the tape was discovered
5053376 the american translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it
5053377 the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned on osama bin ladens most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
5053378 bin laden has not been formally charged in connection with 9 11
5053379 the fbi gathers evidence once evidence is gathered it is turned over to the department of justice the department of justice then decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury in the case of the 1998 united states embassies being bombed bin laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury he has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9 11 because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11
5053380 we havent heard much from him i e bin laden and i wouldnt necessarily say hes at the center of any command structure and again i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him

5053383 received all of the department of defense documents on able danger and had found no mention of atta
5053384 the 9 11 commission failed to recognize the sustained comprehensive efforts conducted by the intelligence community prior to 9 11 to penetrate the al qaeda organization

5053388 the great conspiracy the 9 11 news special you never saw
5053389 i was not involved in the september 11 attacks in the united states nor did i have knowledge of the attacks there exists a government within a government within the united states the united states should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between islam and christianity that secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks the american system is totally in the control of the jews whose first priority is israel not the united states i have already said that we are not hostile to the united states we are against the system which makes other nations slaves of the united states or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom

5053414 we manage a large number of clinics in several states benz said as we grow our firm manage clients and train employees mystery shopping helps us grasp how we can differentiate ourselves from a customer service perspective plus in a highly regulated environment like health care it is even more important to audit service to be sure we are in regulatory compliance

5053416 sab amos que era cuesti n de tiempo el abrir el marcador por ah atlas tuvo dos oportunidades que no supo concretar y para nosotros afortunadamente se logr el gol
5053417 sab amos de antemano que atlas no iba a regalar absolutamente nada que iba a salir en la b squeda de un buen resultado pero afortunadamente sali bien lo que hab amos planteado durante la semana el trabajo que se hizo durante todos estos d as el d a de hoy se llev a cabo y sacamos los tres puntos
5053418 tambi n coincido con l no ha sido el mejor partido que hemos jugado pero lo m s importante de esto es que no se bajaron los brazos para nosotros lo m s importante es sumar de la manera como sea tenemos un objetivo muy claro estamos trabajando para conseguirlo y tenemos que hacer lo que est de nuestra parte para lograrlo
5053419 el equipo hizo su trabajo hizo su esfuerzo fue un partido muy trabado en medio campo quiz no muy vistoso los dos equipos lucharon en cada disputa y afortunadamente el resultado se nos dio quiz no de la manera como la gente lo esperaba pero el equipo sabe que a base de esfuerzo a base de trabajo se sacan los resultados
5053420 capaz que no somos el equipo que tiene mayor calidad o mejor vol men de juego pero es un equipo que es constante y equilibrado y parejo en todas sus l neas y estas encontrando una buena contundencia y empezamos a tener contundencia y a pesar de que ya no est el chango moreno hay jugadores que lo est n haciendo muy bien
5053421 creo que el equipo hizo bien las cosas porque al atlas ya lo ten amos bien estudiado y en los primeros minutos te quieren sacar la diferencia y mientras m s largo se hiciera el partido mejor para nosotros porque somos un equipo que tiene mucha estabilidad y mayor orden y por suerte tuvimos contundencia arriba as que la clave de este partido era aguantarlos porque ellos nos iban a agobiar y pasar esos minutos de agobio y si pasaban esos minutos ser a mejor para nosotros
5053422 soy un tipo humilde y pienso en objetivos cortos y es algo que en nuestra cabeza lo tenemos asumido y hay que ir paso a paso por suerte ahora estamos en otra situaci n hemos pasado momentos muy malos y ahora es un momento muy bueno de los mejores en la historia del san luis y hay que aprovechar esto
5053423 hablando del partido de hoy nos miramos a la cara y creo dimos todo en la cancha desafortunadamente no se dio el resultado fue un partido que jugamos con mucha inteligencia en el primer tiempo en el segundo dominaos gran parte y bueno enfrentamos a un equipo muy experimentado y aprovecharon sus dos chances que tuvieron
5053424 ya sab amos que ser a as el partido es un equipo que trabaja bien los partidos de visitante y bueno se dio como pens bamos y no supimos aprovechar nuestras oportunidades
5053425 el ambiente obviamente no es de felicidad m s que nada hay tristeza porque hicimos todo para ganar el partido
5053426 creo que sab amos que atlas desde un principio del encuentro se ir a a jugar a lo seguro y tratar a de ganar y arriesgar porque no hab an tenido los resultados que ellos quieren y nosotros aguantamos muy bien el primer tiempo y nos cost mucho trabajo la cancha y se nos quedaba mucho la pelota estaba muy crecido el pasto un poquito de ventaja de ellos porque eso se hace con la intenci n de sacar ventaja como local y lo importante es que aguantamos as el primer tiempo y en el segundo tuvimos m s posici n de la pelota y un mejor trato y la consecuencia est ah y aprovechamos bien los contragolpes
5053427 fuimos inteligentes y ese es un atributo que tiene este equipo y tiene experiencia y sabe leer bien los partidos y se suma a las ganas de trascender y a la juventud de algunos jugadores y son cositas que se van hilvanando para que este equipo siga siendo protagonista
5053428 creo que independientemente de lo que tengan que hacer ellos nosotros tenemos que seguir pensando en mejorar y seguir pensando en crecer como jugadores como instituci n y la realidad es que el torneo es joven se han cumplido algunos objetivos pero lo importantes todav a est n lejos

5053443 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5053444 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5053445 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5053446 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5053447 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear

5053454 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
5053455 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
5053456 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
5053457 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

5053466 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5053467 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5053468 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5053469 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5053470 it looks like valeri has snapped his achilles and will be out for six months it is a huge blow for the lad
5053471 we are all desperately disappointed for him this has come on top of being out for a year already so it is a huge blow for him
5053472 it was also not an ideal way for us to start this game
5053473 you could see the confidence go flooding into gabby once he had scored that first goal the other two goals were magnificent and i was delighted for him
5053474 in terms of england his time will come it is a long season and he knows what is ahead this is a great start for him
5053475 i was a bit surprised ashley did not get in the england squad but his time will come as well i have no doubts whatsoever that they will make it through
5053476 we had the better of the first half but had a couple of chances we did not take
5053477 i felt at half time we just needed more of the same but we had to be careful because in possession city were very good
5053478 they were never out of the game and when they got back to 1 1 a game can go in either direction but the way gabby took his goals was superb
5053479 the discovery channel and planet green have teamed up with ludacris and tommy lee and are going to communities cleaning up parks so kids can come out and play
5053480 this time they turned one of oaklands parks into an astro turf field
5053481 it was just good to see that the kids in oakland have a nice safe place to play
5053482 it looks like a nice field and its going to be used well
5053483 it was great giving back to the community being a home grown kid
5053484 every time i have an opportunity to give back to oakland i definitely want to show my support as much as possible

5053512 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan
5053513 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5053514 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban
5053515 canada is in afghanistan at the request of the democratically elected government of that country
5053516 we will continue to protect the afghan people from these ruthless killers
5053517 the taliban demonstrates time and again its willingness to target civilians including afghan civilians as part of their efforts
5053518 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you
5053519 but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children
5053520 if we arrest their journalists or aid workers we will target them as we did in logar province they are not differentiating women and children with military targets and we will not differentiate theirs too

5053527 you cant take anything lightly everyones fighting for places and everyones fighting to get ready to go
5053528 by the very nature of that it will be a proper game
5053529 what i know about scotland is that when they played against sussex they were always massively up for the game so you have to be up for the game as well
5053530 we didnt because seconds before the number ten odonovan whos very good at this jumps into people and doesnt actually head it
5053531 he jumped into mick so its a foul before that
5053532 i thought we should have had that decision so we wouldnt be talking about the penalty to be honest with you
5053533 five times that could have happened because im sure that when you jump for the ball youre supposed to jump for the ball and not into the man which happened quite a lot
5053534 i thought mick and gary considering that were excellent they kept their temper well and when you talk about respect for the referee i know were not signing the charter but they did very well
5053535 hes had a chance to finish it but he didnt take it that happens every now and then but its an honest mistake but look at the equalising goal we thought that we could have done more about that and wont worry too much about scotts miss
5053536 we played well in the first half and their goalkeeper made several good saves to keep them in the match
5053537 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle which is swollen up badly hell be out for two to three weeks we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5053538 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5053539 newcastle were good on the counter attack and in obafemi martins and damien duff they have players with quality in these positions if you dont stop them they can be dangerous
5053540 we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a credible result for us

5053546 the longer you look out the more likely it is that stocks will outperform
5053547 sure you may lose money on the first lump sum you put into the market but youre not going to lose money every time after that

5053552 la carrera ha sido un poco triste porque sabemos que tenemos m s potencial para hacerlo mejor
5053553 despu s de ver lo que ha sucedido este fin de semana y sobre todo los problemas en el neum tico delantero pienso que hemos conseguido casi el m ximo
5053554 en la salida no he querido tomar demasiados riesgos porque el neum tico delantero no iba muy bien pero poco a poco si ve a que el trasero mejoraba y pude hacer tiempos cada vez mejores
5053555 s que hemos tenido problemas pero tambi n que michel n est trabajando muy duro as que intentaremos mejorar desde ma ana en los test
5053556 me siento muy feliz por el cuarto podio de la temporada
5053557 hemos vuelto a demostrar que podemos estar en la lucha por el titulo
5053558 los cilindros el material nuevo que hemos recibido este fin de semana han hecho que seamos competitivos hemos vuelto a demostrar que podemos estar en la lucha por el t tulo
5053559 hemos vuelto a disfrutar y a ser competitivos en una gran jornada
5053560 lo m s formidable ha sido demostrar que nada es imposible
5053561 most people have a notion that elderly people have very weak immunity or they have lost immunity
5053562 this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5053563 its important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus that has implications for new pandemic viruses
5053564 the elderly might be a very good donor source for finding antibodies against viruses
5053565 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5053566 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along
5053567 the implication of this study is the 1918 virus was so powerful that the immunity you had to have in order to survive was so prominent that it lasted for the rest of your life
5053568 so those in certain age groups who had seen a related virus had the strongest responses
5053569 either they died or they developed a profound immune response

5053572 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5053573 the rube goldberg aspect of biological systems is not like this at all and has been demonstrated in a fair number of cases to be
5053574 well the eye is very complex so no simple algorithm can find it
5053575 is there a smooth path of increasing fitness through genotype space beginning from some reasonable starting point and ending with the eye
5053576 are we allowed to sample enough points to traverse the entire path
5053577 the appendix used to be useful and is now worse than useless
5053578 it will never ever turn out that an unused transistor in a ga circuit has a purpose i didnt expect
5053579 the fact that your gas produce solutions with truly uselss parts is simply an artifact of whatever fitness function you are using
5053580 the appendix used to be useful and is now worse than useless
5053581 here hamilton caustically and incorrectly a bad combination asserts that the appendix is useless and i infer therefore a ga like rube goldberg artifact
5053582 alas the appendix is now known to have a function in the digestive and lymphatic systems
5053583 that is at one time the appendix might have been the equivalent of an unused transistor in a ga designed circuit but no more
5053584 calling an organ vestigial does not necessarily mean it is functionless some vestigial organs may be truly functionless but it is always difficult to confirm universal negative statements fossil whales called basilosaurus which lived 40 million years ago had functional pelvic bones and may have used them when copulating the vestigial pelvis of modern whales arguably is still needed to support the reproductive organs however that possibility does not count against the argument from homology why if whales originated independently of other tetrapods should they use bones that are adapted for limb articulation to support their reproductive organs if they were truly independent some other support would be used
5053585 if human bodies were designed by todays gas wed look like monstrosities or at least picassos
5053586 gas produce extraneous components often a nontrivial percentage of the whole
5053587 in our materialism were losing the distinction between money power and celebrity as compared with knowledge and wisdom now were seeing a world in which clarity between good and evil right and wrong knowledge and ignorance men and women is disappearing into a borderless and indistinguishable gray for whatever good intentions pastor rick warren may have by posturing as a neutral broker between different points of view many of which have profound moral and religious implications and he contributes to the moral ambiguity which wed expect a pastor to be combating we have institutions for civic and political forums the press universities town halls etc if theyre not delivering well let the marketplace work to improve what were getting but this is not the job of pastors or churches if it is where do we go to learn about good and evil what exactly is going on in america when our obsession is to cleanse every inch of public space from religion yet somehow we think it is appropriate to bring a presidential political forum into church our kids cant pray in public school or read the bible or learn to apply traditional values in managing their lives the ten commandments cannot appear in our courthouses a creche cannot be displayed in a public space during christmas season yet somehow we think a church is an appropriate forum for hosting candidates for president our world is turning upside down rather than raising our public and private lives to a higher moral standard were politicizing religion its actually worse i think the pretense of neutrality is really a left wing illusion its a sleight of hand to buy into relativism and somehow warren seems to have fallen into the trap when a pastor hosts a political candidate that has a 100 percent rating by naral pro choice america and a zero percent rating by the national right to life committee he gives legitimacy to that candidate when legitimacy is given to a line reasoning that says that poverty and aids are symptoms of anything other than moral breakdown the relativist views of the left are justified to a disproportionate measure when we are talking about poverty and aids in america we are talking about black communities these communities are in disarray because of moral ambiguity they not only need moral clarity and leadership they crave it partisanship is not our problem today healthy partisanship is vital to freedom our problem is moral ambiguity anyone that thinks this ambiguity is helpful in addressing poverty crime and disease is misinformed we need political leaders that are more moral not church leaders that are more political
5053588 we need to take a serious look at the kind of wasteful expenditure that has gone on around the olympic games
5053589 now makhenkesi stofile the minister of sport seems to have wasted r11m of taxpayers money on a publicity expo for sa
5053590 the organisation of the expo has been a shambles sic we urge the portfolio committee on sport to summon the department to explain why so much money has been squandered on an opportunity to market our country
5053591 regulating texas blogs would be regulation with out representation regulation that doesnt protect the rights of citizens is not good government
5053592 reasonable and fair comment on or criticism of an official act or public official or other matter of public concern published for general information

5053597 weve been forced into the challenge of caring for a smart stubborn high strung 2 year old we love him very much but thats not the kind of work either of us wants at least not full time
5053598 we care about you but youre such a pain in the ass we really just dont want you around much and it stresses us out when you are around
5053599 carols gold is going to be a great thing for us
5053600 im from alberta and lots of young girls are taking up the sport
5053601 youd be surprised how many little girls are taking up wrestling and i certainly do think this will be inspiration for a lot more little girls to take it up
5053602 i hope womens wrestling in canada and specifically quebec where im from will become even more popular now
5053603 i had a really tough match in the semis against the now olympic champion
5053604 its really tough but in this sport if the score is tied 1 1 the last wrestler who scores is the winner and i lost both of my matches like that its just so disappointing overall it was a great experience but next time ill just have to finish the job
5053605 i lost my first bout to the world champion and my last fight was close and a real battle
5053606 i didnt win a medal but at the end of the day this is still great there are four female weight classes we got two medals out of that including canadas first gold and came as close as you can come to getting a third medal today
5053607 im proud to be carol huynhs team mate im proud she won canadas first gold medal in our sport and of these olympics im proud of tonya and im proud of martine
5053608 what happened here with this four person team put us on the map when tonya was second at the olympics in athens it didnt really do that nobody took too long of a look at this
5053609 there were only four of us and all four of us were world class and when it comes to funding now dont forget about it weve been funding ourselves if i have to get to a tournament ill get there that was my attitude but theyll look at us now
5053610 i know its the middle of the night but my wife is due on sept 20
5053611 she got up in the middle of the night to watch the race its been a long haul for us and i wanted to share the excitement with her
5053612 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and brambell said go for it we committed everything we had
5053613 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
5053614 i had been on the team since 1995 and thought i was done
5053615 basically my life was rowing and i hadnt had a chance to develop other aspects but bent believes you can have a job and still row i wasnt done with the sport i was just done with devoting my whole life to it
5053616 he was sick all week and i think it was really important for us to make sure that he didnt leave his home and his country for nothing when he was in that condition

5053621 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safe haven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5053622 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5053623 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5053624 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they militants would have known women and children were present
5053625 it was subsequently revealed that the bryce committee did not personally interview a single witness relying instead on hearsay evidence and depositions given without oaths a belgian commission of enquiry in 1922 failed to corroborate a single major allegation in the bryce report
5053626 god will save her fear you not be you the men youve been
5053627 there would have been no war propaganda without the war no atrocity stories without atrocities although the entente press wildly exagerrated what went on in belgium there is no question that the german army did commit atrocities there in 1914 according to evidence from the diaries of german soldiers and other reliable sources all the advancing german armies executed civilians including women and priests altogether about 5 500 belgian civilians were deliberately killed by the german army most of them in the eleven day period from 18 14th august 1914 and at least another 500 in france the germans also used civilians as human shields and razed numerous villages to the ground in one case an eighteen year old girl was bayonnetted to death there were also numerous rapes in occupied france

5053633 it diminishes my whole career and all the hard work i take it as an insult
5053634 how do i get content related to what my market wants quickly
5053635 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5053636 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5053637 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5053638 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet pemberton said when asked if the penalties were likely to be severe
5053639 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5053640 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5053641 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5053642 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5053643 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honour you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5053644 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5053645 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5053646 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5053647 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5053648 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5053649 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5053650 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5053651 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5053652 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5053653 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5053654 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5053655 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5053656 well youre obviously some sort of a band or something
5053657 what i want to know is how you fit in with these people
5053658 a vast scent that opens the lungs and cools the skin

5053661 two suspects jumped out of the stationary kombi to avoid arrest when they saw the police
5053662 the suspect shot himself in the head when he saw police he died on the scene four more alleged hijackers were arrested inside the house
5053663 the most recent advancement in this research is the ability to selectively pattern the coating and spatially control the wetting behavior for a desired application
5053664 this allows us to define the pathways along which water droplets will roll
5053665 claverach park is close to obtaining a neighborhood designation as a national historic district work has also begun to have the 7500 blocks multi family portion of the moorlands so designated as well and speaking of history have you been on a walking architectural tour of ward ii with elsey hamilton preservationist for st louis county elsey led a fascinating tour of claverach park and the moorlands in early june there are architectural features of homes you may not have noticed before watch the parks and recreation brochure for a tour of your favorite neighborhood
5053666 collagen is a great house for a cell to grow but there are places where you should not have collagen
5053667 tumors or blood clots that can lead to a stroke are primarily made of collagen
5053668 the collagen mimetic peptide was able to sneak into the natural collagen fibers at regularly spaced intervals where the structure of collagen was more loosely bound
5053669 that tells us that in a natural system the collagen mimetic peptide is binding only to the collagen and not to other proteins and that has never been shown before
5053670 cmp can penetrate tissue that the antibodies which are at least 20 times larger cannot
5053671 the longer the chain the longer cmp tended to stay in place
5053672 one of the areas were working on now is targeted delivery of these functionalized cmps
5053673 the key will be whether we can make them recognize the difference between normal collagen and pathological collagen
5053674 collagen is a very complicated system and we still dont know a lot about it
5053675 using synthetic systems can give you a lot of information and are great for mechanistic studies of cell and scaffold interactions but eventually many scientists come back to the natural scaffold that nature has provided the collagen when they need to create artificial tissues
5053676 tissue engineering is an exciting field were creating solutions to problems that can significantly impact peoples quality of life
5053677 these gels have great promise in not only regenerating bone but serving as a gene therapy delivery system
5053678 not a jack of all trades and master of none but rather an expert across disciplines
5053679 even if the students primary area of study is physics for example he or she should be also capable of producing the quality of biological research expected of biologists
5053680 the innovation of inbt graduate programs is the bringing together of talented students from a wide variety of backgrounds we teach each other about our fields which also requires learning our own more in depth
5053681 the students in a sense play matchmaker for researchers who might not otherwise work together this helps everyone involved produce work that uniquely advances nanobiotechnology in a way that it could not have been had these researchers been working independently
5053682 i really broadened my understanding of molecular biology and was able to work with quantum dots and use lab techniques such as gel electrophoresis or pcr that i had only read about
5053683 i dont think there is a war on terror there is a war

5053689 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5053690 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5053691 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5053692 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans
5053693 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5053694 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5053695 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5053696 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them
5053697 het was n groot feest het weer was goed het publiek was fantastisch de sfeer was goed kortom een super geslaagd boerenrockfestival welke zonder problemen is verlopen
5053698 de derde en vierde editie van het boerenrockfestival zullen worden gehouden op de laatse zaterdag van augustus en n van de bands die al weer is gecontrateerd is mooi wark
5053699 your appreciation means a lot i am so glad we met
5053700 great rapping with you yesterday it is really terrific that there is a person like you out there promoting and enhancing a wide understanding of yoga and how it is practiced here keep up your excellent work

5053708 most americans and most jewish americans support the two state solution and are tired of having a likud oriented lobby speaking in their name
5053709 the threat of a nuclear iran its destabilizing regional influence and the vile rhetoric of its president are all real
5053710 hey president mahmoud ahmadinejad was just mistranslated when he threatened to wipe israel off the map
5053711 american assistance to israel including maintaining israels qualitative military edge is an important anchor for a peace process based on providing israel with the confidence and assurance to move forward on a solution based on land for peace
5053712 from all corners of the country republicans and democrats arab americans and jews incumbents and newly minted challengers all who share jstreetpacs belief in the strategic value of tough smart diplomacy to help resolve conflicts in the middle east
5053713 he co founded avaaz org an internet advocacy group with a truly global reach spent years waging peace in west africa and is a signatory to the responsible plan to end the war in iraq toms expertise in transnational justice also took him to darfur where he met with rebel and civilian leaders to advance a new round of peace negotiations in 2005 he believes that a two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict is key and that congress should not tie the parties hands as they attempt to reach this goal
5053714 we took the opportunity of attending a capitol hill hearing at which dr john mearsheimer was a panelist to ask him if as a researcher he would find it misleading if jstreetpac were included among the other pro israel pacs not at all replied the co author of the israel lobby and u s foreign policy and thats good enough for us
5053715 the appearance of j street is evidence that increasing numbers of american jews understand that israels policies in the occupied territories are going to have a disastrous outcome for israel that israel is in effect is going to end up as an apartheid state
5053716 apparently in mearsheimers view an organization that advocates a two state solution opposes war with iran and describes israeli settlements as

5053743 brian eno and i recently finished our first collaboration in about 30 years for the most part brian did the music and i wrote some tunes words and sang its familiar but completely new as well were pretty excited in august the music will be available via this web site free for streaming and available for purchase in a variety of options that allow you to download immediately and receive physical formats when they become available later in the fall one of the songs will be available free of charge

5053747 there are some things i still want to do to raise the bar a bit more in the world of swimming
5053748 i would say i would like to go down and start sprinting but bob isnt so keen on that
5053749 well see how keen he is on going to the sprints
5053750 there is more and different training hes more naturally suited to longer events
5053751 i think over the next four years i would like to try new events and see what happens
5053752 bob has said he wants to start fresh and do things he hasnt done before new training methods and stuff like that
5053753 we are going to look at some different events mix up the training programme a little bit and do some experiment we have accomplished this set of goals and i would dare to venture to say we are not going to do it again at least not like this
5053754 we will start coming up with some goals that excite him and start working towards them
5053755 i am looking forward to seeing friends hanging out and sitting down
5053756 bob has a saying about putting money in bank and this week was about making withdrawals i guess ive gotten through every penny now its time to start making redeposits
5053757 i dont want this sport to be an every four year sport
5053758 we get lots of attention every four years but for the rest of that time there is really not a lot of attention
5053759 we swim every single day there is never really an off season i just want more people to get involved in the sport and i think it will happen in the next four years
5053760 the reason why i was so emotional is that i have dreamed of a lot of things and written things down
5053761 this was the biggest thing i have ever written down thinking of all the things i have done to get here everything i have gone through

5053792 i hate to sound like an oldtimer but sometimes i get upset about the young guys
5053793 weve got guys like arn anderson barry windham ricky steamboat and michael hayes around thats a wealth of knowledge and they still have to make it mandatory for guys to show up early and go into the ring with them
5053794 when i got into the business you couldnt get me out of the building i had a burning desire to get better now the young guys seem more interested in their i pods or playing guitar hero
5053795 i see guys complaining ive been here for five years and theyre not doing anything with me
5053796 its put a whole new spin on life for me its changed my perspective about whats important in life i dont know if its softened me up but it changes the way you look at women im probably going to pay for my past
5053797 when vince told me i said id go wherever he needed me it really screws me personally but well make it work you know when you get into this line of work youre going to be gone a lot its really important that the time i get to spend with my family is quality time

5053801 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
5053802 after as is now i thought the time was right to make the sort of record i wanted to make
5053803 instead of worrying about anyone else i wanted to really push the boat out i think the result is going to surprise a few people
5053804 ive never understood the need to put music into boxes
5053805 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5053806 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5053807 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5053808 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5053809 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5053810 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5053813 my husband put me on the dining table with my baby and my son was on the top of the pantry
5053814 when we were taken out of the house i didnt even have a nappy for my baby
5053815 it became so traumatic that we just moved out of the place i just couldnt bear to live there
5053816 when we moved in we had a huge truck which had difficulty turning in the street
5053817 we went through arbitration and we took it up with a lawyer
5053818 finally the lawyer told us it was a big insurance company we did have a chance of winning it but if we lost we faced a very big bill
5053819 its such a fantastic effort by people to bring together not only the vehicles but the ancillary equipment so that people can see the evolution of the vehicle and the service that went with it
5053820 no one else has done it like they do it here you will not find a better example around of that whole integrated approach
5053821 im pretty keen to see it a must see for anyone coming down to the south coast
5053822 its more than a motoring museum its almost a lifestyle museum
5053823 at times its been a nightmare at other times its been very very fulfilling
5053824 weve been talking about this for 12 years so its exactly as we envisaged it
5053825 our intention going in is to clearly outline from a wollongong point of view as to why a new western grandstand is necessary
5053826 its not an impediment at the moment but it will be an impediment if a south coast team is granted entry into the a league
5053827 we want this committee to set some advice and give us some broad parameters
5053828 there has been some community concern and we have looked to find some way to include them
5053829 i will probably have a barbecue and drop a card in their mailbox saying listen if you want to meet the neighbours come down and say hello
5053830 i hope she enjoys it its a great spot to be
5053831 it will be nice to have her as a neighbour
5053832 i think there are mixed feelings because its a quiet town and they dont want the paparazzi
5053833 but i thought it was good just the fact that we have a celebrity about the place and it might lift the land values a bit
5053834 everyones talking about it and there have been a fair few people who have come here especially
5053835 she used to lock herself out all the time and come down here and pick me up and i was always terrified because she was a shocking driver
5053836 the great problem from the nrma perspective was that on one hand this was clearly a disaster and we wanted to help policyholders
5053837 on the other hand in the strictest interpretation of their policies and indeed in the simple interpretation of their policies very few people were covered
5053838 i certainly wasnt thrilled with the way it was handled but i was a chairman not the chief executive
5053839 the dilemma was the nrma wanted to pay as best we could but we didnt want to create a precedent
5053840 i found it quite disturbing i knew we were going to meet as a board to establish as a policy something that would effectively have everyone paid out
5053841 we found a way through existing policies to achieve outcomes but it wasnt easy
5053842 one of the consequences is a lot more careful planning and zoning of flood prone home sites
5053843 power drawn from the tree of life at any of its points must be replaced by something of equal value to that which is received
5053844 during my whole spiritual adolescence she nurtured me gave me everything i needed to become me i am the selfhood liberated i am yin oh what a magnificent body nature gave me for the pleasure of the senses that i might reach out and gather jewels to my ego my all time friend
5053845 come unto me all ye who are burdened and i will give you rest
5053846 think thou that i love less than any earthly father am less the faithful friend uncovering the soul or less responsible less equitable than any business partner or less than dedicated monarch in my role

5053863 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5053864 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5053865 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5053866 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5053867 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5053868 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5053869 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5053870 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5053871 it is a struggle something we must deal with but with enough money and the right time and if we stay the course theres no reason we cant get there
5053872 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5053873 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5053874 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services
5053875 a year from today well still be talking about financial problems its not going away
5053876 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5053877 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5053878 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped

5053885 i was pleased with the effort of our entire football team they did great work against the cowboys both wednesday and thursday we got a lot of things done especially with our young guys during that second drive today we had a couple penalties and we overcame a few of our mistakes but overall i thought we played extremely hard from start to finish i thought we did better tonight
5053886 to be honest we played really well against them a couple days in a row and i felt pretty good about our run defense i thought we fared well i think we played pretty well against a houston team that will do well this season we made some strides but obviously were not there
5053887 yes we planned on playing them the entire first half i wasnt going to do it after that second drive we wanted to get them in a game situation we got a lot of young people out there we have a new tackle and a new guard out there and we want to build cohesiveness
5053888 ive said that i believe in these guys they have a lot of fight but they dont have a lot of experience so what we have to do is keep on getting guys in there to learn
5053889 hes got exceptional ability and great speed and great quickness you guys saw him the first day he wanted the starting role and he embraced the challenge he has been very consistent in practice and done pretty well in the game
5053890 you can always get better thats why you practice thats why you work you always try to improve jay is going to be hard on himself theres not a lot of perfect games out there so if you think youre perfect youre going to be embarrassed pretty quickly
5053891 were going to do what were going to do jays doing a great job of passing the ball hes doing a good job of spreading the ball around against the dallas cowboys you better be able to throw it because they have an excellent front seven and their safety support is doing well
5053892 te daniel graham had a tight hamstring so he came out after the first series and hopefully theres no setback there and the guys that got banged up during practice were kept out for obvious reasons
5053893 he tweaked his ankle on the opening kickoff he came back later on im not sure how many plays he played
5053894 we had great tempo starting with the offensive line we came in and we did a great job they gave me time we got the running game going
5053895 those guys dallas defensive line run a 3 4 you dont know where theyre coming they have great edge pressure we had the inside zone going and good push up front it all started with those guys denvers offensive line they got the tempo going for us that kept them dallas off balance they gave me some time to throw the ball you got to give those guys some credit
5053896 its a great balance the guy gets knocked around a little bit he was hard to take down you gotta love his attitude out there the running back battle is heating up all of those guys get in there and get the ball and make something happen its good to watch
5053897 we came out and played well as a team and that was the goal we came out and stuck together and put together some good drives and i think we did that today
5053898 we had a scouting report on them because we practiced against them for two days so we knew they were sitting on our routes a little bit it was something we had in our game plan and we came out and executed it
5053899 you kind of have a cheat sheet i got a chance to study the dbs up close and personal it paid off today we played well together we just need to keep building on it
5053900 ever week we have a couple of tricks for our games we didnt show them everything we had but we came out and played well
5053901 it comes from a lot of preparation and having guys around me helping me out brandon marshall brandon stokley keary colbert darrell jackson and the list goes on and on including coach theyre making it real easy for me right now
5053902 its one of those things where we put in the work and it showed tonight
5053903 absolutely you cant forget the other guy over there eddie royal that kid is amazing
5053904 they cant they just have to be fair theyre going to try me early on and theyre going to have to continue to try me im still not proven but im going to continue to punish them
5053905 you cant take anything lightly everyones fighting for places and everyones fighting to get ready to go
5053906 by the very nature of that it will be a proper game
5053907 what i know about scotland is that when they played against sussex they were always massively up for the game so you have to be up for the game as well
5053908 we avoided all the rain yesterday only for that wed be in big trouble
5053909 if we can start on tuesday we should have no trouble as it is supposed to be good for the week we have fresh ground each day
5053910 theyre trying to clean up chandler and im kind of pro what theyre doing
5053911 ultimately it is going to be a significant asset to downtown especially in how its being designed
5053912 we were the internet guys who got out of corporate america and took our severances and our 401k money and started a business six years ago
5053913 it was where we started our business but at the same time it wasnt the end of our business
5053914 its just progress and you just go with the flow
5053915 they took away a lot of future income from me and i would still have the property
5053916 now i have a little bit of money not a hell of a lot and no property
5053917 you are asking a business to move out of an operation that supports eight locations in four different ways
5053918 we believe it will be a real gem in the downtown
5053919 if we were more attached and we were making plans to stay there and our only livelihood was the rent from those units it probably would have been a much different experience
5053920 i did not like the fact that they said if you dont sell to us eventually were going to take it away anyway that wasnt very nice
5053921 we played well in the first half and their goalkeeper made several good saves to keep them in the match
5053922 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle which is swollen up badly hell be out for two to three weeks we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5053923 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5053924 newcastle were good on the counter attack and in obafemi martins and damien duff they have players with quality in these positions if you dont stop them they can be dangerous
5053925 we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a credible result for us

5053939 my gut instinct is that there will be a wide disparity about what rates are quoted on these sites and what they actually end up with and not necessarily due to the borrower
5053940 all the sites may not collect all the data thats necessary to give an actual price quote
5053941 its easy reliable accurate and fast theres no bait and switch
5053942 a lot of the larger chains have complex structures with multiple layers of management they send a lot of money to their corporate offices there can be a lot of distance between the owners and the facilities themselves theyre not on the ground
5053943 you cant just look at the ownership structure and draw conclusions
5053944 inadequate medicaid funding is going to be the biggest differential in any of these buildings
5053945 our experience has been that when a facility is under the control of a large corporation which has put multiple layers of accountability between decision makers and the facility resources are drained away from care
5053946 if you see a couple of homes in a chain beginning to fail what does that tell you
5053947 and thats the thing we need to work on so is it two of 20 then that would require an intervention or is that just statistical chance as opposed to a corporate strategy is it four is it six those are the kinds of things that we need to investigate
5053948 we dont have the research now to be able to separate the signal from the noise
5053949 ill do whatever it takes to make sure my buildings are providing good care
5053950 its almost impossible for a consumer to learn about a home from the data thats collected by cms
5053951 my gut instinct is that there will be a wide disparity about what rates are quoted on these sites and what they actually end up with and not necessarily due to the borrower
5053952 all the sites may not collect all the data thats necessary to give an actual price quote
5053953 its easy reliable accurate and fast theres no bait and switch
5053954 the review all but ignores the database state yet strangely 2 aims to bolster the powers of the information commissioners office and seeks to make life more convenient for medical researchers
5053955 this hasnt really done anything to protect ordinary individuals and leaves the door wide open for your personal information to be further debauched by government
5053956 all the spin is about a minor change to the electoral register their big change is to cut down junk mail but what about the very real dangers of the national identity register 3 contactpoint 4 and the nhs secondary uses service 5
5053957 while there is a place for the interception of telephone and internet communication when properly warranted and authorised by a court in the course of a specific criminal investigation the idea of a giant monolithic database containing the phone and internet records of every british citizen is as monstrous in principle as it is technically absurd
5053958 if true this would effectively short circuit the negligible safeguards that currently exist and provide 1 400 public bodies 3 from the post office to the financial services authority with easy access to your data
5053959 not only another catastrophic blow to privacy liberties and freedom from state interference this alongside cradle to grave monitoring through the childrens database contactpoint and the national identity scheme will be another founding stone in building all that is required for a surveillance state
5053960 unlike the ips we cant afford to waste money on spin dressed up as a poll we care what people really think we are trying to persuade them not con them
5053961 whats fascinating here is that we asked the public two different seeming questions that are about the same thing
5053962 campaigning experience suggests that the more people know about the id scheme the more they dislike it now here is some solid evidence that it is true
5053963 the government has proposed the introduction of identity cards that in combination with your passport will cost around 93
5053964 you may have heard that the government intends to collect information about citizens and store it on large computer systems which can then be used for a wide range of purposes do you think storing information and sharing it between different parts of government in this way is a good bad idea

5053976 three generations of her family live work and worship in eastern hillsborough county and rachel is a part of that legacy we are excited as we look towards her victory in november

5053981 tambi n hay cosas que perjudican a todos no s lo a los argentinos el calor la humedad
5053982 bajo esa clase de factores no se hacen partidos con el ritmo al que tienen que estar
5053983 ha sido un partido dif cil creamos situaciones que no pudimos concretar y holanda es un rival duro con buenos jugadores pero a lo largo de todo el partido fuimos superiores los que m s situaciones de peligro creamos sobre todo en el primer tiempo

5053990 the 4400 entre outras que talvez esteja esquecendo de mencionar
5053991 the bulk of written texts including the paper i am actually reading to you no longer exist in perceivable time and space but in a computer memorys transistor cells
5053992 this state of affairs does not only make a difference to history it also seems to hide the very act of writing
5053993 all code operations despite such metaphoric faculties as call or return come down to absolutely local string manipulations that is i am afraid
5053994 the bulk of written texts including the paper i am actually reading to you no longer exist in perceivable time and space but in a computer memorys transistor cells
5053995 sadly on the streets of our cities we see evil in parents who viciously abuse their children
5053996 this is an issue that is not on the table
5053997 everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he was he kept to his word he took off the uniform theres now a democratic government in pakistan
5053998 u know that amazing ability u have to stuff a whole digestive biscuit in ur mouth well ive just
5053999 perhaps gordon brown simply doesnt get it he says he is satisfied the id scheme minimises information when the reverse is the case it is designed as a mass surveillance scheme like nothing else on earth
5054000 terrorism is a complete red herring but on this showing the question has to be how much ministers have deliberately misled the public and how much they have misled themselves who in government has got a clue
5054001 the government should give an explicit undertaking to adhere to a principle of data minimisation and should resist a tendency to collect more personal information and establish larger databases any decision to create a major new database to share information on databases or to implement proposals for increased surveillance should be based on a proven need
5054002 minimisation of data is common sense for both privacy and security a pity then that the national identity scheme offers precisely the opposite its whole conception is to join together as much personal information possible and keep it available forever maximisation of data

5054010 la clave es que tenemos una conciencia de trabajo todos competimos de la mejor manera as como tambi n todos quieren mejorar de forma individual as que eso hace que el plantel est metido y que trabaje de la mejor manera esa es la nica f rmula que tenemos
5054011 falta mucho despu s empieza otro torneo que en la liguilla debemos de seguir con esta constancia con esta intensidad viviendo al m ximo los partidos y ahora ya estamos pensando en nuestro siguiente rival que es tigres
5054012 fue un partido muy dif cil con un atlas que jug muy bien que el planteamiento que hizo en muchas partes del partido nos confundi por lo que sabemos que nos queda la tarea de esta manera de jugar para que luego al final no pasemos tantos problemas para poder ganar al rival
5054013 atlas tambi n tuvo sus oportunidades no las aprovech el equipo tambi n se defendi bien y aprovech la que tuvimos y eso fue claro para que al final nos llevemos el triunfo
5054014 imaginem um sistema geral de auto avalia o em que os alunos n o mais estudariam para as provas mas estudariam para ser teis na vida
5054015 vamos a trabajar m s tranquilos porque se hizo un buen trabajo
5054016 no podemos desesperarnos pues esto sigue porque y luego lo aprovecha el rival que nos toca fueron dos derrotas dolorosas pero te queda mucho para reprochar el partido pasado porque fuimos diferentes no fuimos ni sombra de lo que fue atlas y hoy se levant con la mala fortuna de irnos con la mala suerte de vuelta
5054017 ser una semana donde vamos a trabajar m s tranquilos porque se hizo un buen trabajo y se sabe que enfrentamos a un rival que aprovech la nica oportunidad que ten a s hay cosas para mejorar estamos en una situaci n inc moda pero hoy nos vamos con otro sabor y estamos tristes porque perdimos pero este fue otro atlas por un lado la derrota nos deja con esa tranquilidad de que hicimos otro papel pero no podemos quedarnos en esto tenemos que volver a la senda ganadora estar tranquilos no desesperarnos y saber que hay mucho por mejorar

5054020 we have finalised the cmp that will be publicised tomorrow
5054021 we have not put forward any hindrance to reach an agreement and our discussions are focused on the allocation of the ministerial portfolio
5054022 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5054023 we have been supportive of democratic elections that took place in pakistan in fact advocated for them
5054024 the message of this procession is that if you want to carry a procession then it should be peaceful with love and quite curfew is only imposed if there are disturbances and noises it is only imposed when there are clashes between the two groups police and civilians our fight is with no one but we have come with a message of peace

5054027 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
5054028 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things especially here winning for me is unbelievable
5054029 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it will take a few days before i realize im olympic champion
5054030 but this is for sure the biggest moment in my career in my life i will never forget this moment
5054031 its a great goal i did it in athens and now i did it here
5054032 the olympics means really a lot to me so thats why im really happy im little bit sad about the match but all things considered im really happy
5054033 paul and storm talk about some stuff for five to ten minutes on average
5054034 it sounds a little funny but believe me i feel comfortable here its still a bit awkward but i dont know how else to tell you i feel like im here for a reason like i told the guys i feel like im here for one reason
5054035 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5054036 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
5054037 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
5054038 it was a little weird but for the most part i felt comfortable in this uniform
5054039 i feel comfortable in this locker room i had numerous people on the redskins team say man it almost dont look right but its got to start looking right
5054040 refrain from organising and joining illegal gatherings and refrain from receiving donations sermons and preaching from overseas religious organisations and groups
5054041 western countries should not support them israel so much the life of this regime has come to an end
5054042 our position is clear on this issue a referendum should take place in palestine if they withdraw from invaded lands it would be a good step
5054043 the life of the regime israel has come to an end
5054044 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
5054045 as you know i feel very strongly about religion the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect
5054046 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
5054047 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principles of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading the muslims borrowed rituals and traditions from all the surrounding religions
5054048 you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed
5054049 there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
5054050 i dont think if you got bin laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared
5054051 just as sept 11 revolutionized our resolve to defeat our enemies so has it brought into focus the opportunities we now have to secure and expand our freedom

5054057 ich habe in der ffentlichen diskussion selten so viel populismus und hysterie erlebt wie in den vergangenen wochen und das alles nur weil sich sat 1 entschieden hat drei informationssendungen abzusetzen deren bedeutung f r die gesellschaft vorher doch eher als bersichtlich wahrgenommen wurde
5054058 wo war denn bitte der jubel als sat 1 die betroffenen sendungen einf hrte ich kann mich nicht erinnern dass auch nur einer der kritiker die jetzt bei der absetzung so laut geschrieen haben zum start der formate von einer bereicherung des publizistischen wettbewerbs schw rmte

5054063 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5054064 i believe the big issues are going to be china and russia
5054065 it doesnt take you long to get home how long does it take you to get home eight hours me too russias a big country and youre a big country
5054066 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
5054067 unfortunately today we are looking evil directly in the eye
5054068 and today this evil is very strong very nasty and very dangerous for everybody not only for us
5054069 we didnt because seconds before the number ten odonovan whos very good at this jumps into people and doesnt actually head it
5054070 he jumped into mick so its a foul before that
5054071 i thought we should have had that decision so we wouldnt be talking about the penalty to be honest with you
5054072 five times that could have happened because im sure that when you jump for the ball youre supposed to jump for the ball and not into the man which happened quite a lot
5054073 i thought mick and gary considering that were excellent they kept their temper well and when you talk about respect for the referee i know were not signing the charter but they did very well
5054074 hes had a chance to finish it but he didnt take it that happens every now and then but its an honest mistake but look at the equalising goal we thought that we could have done more about that and wont worry too much about scotts miss
5054075 were all great athletes and im very excited about the tremendous achievement were very good athletes and this says a lot for our country
5054076 my coach and i we went to the coffee shop and we met the boy who won the 100m who gave me a bunch of flowers
5054077 he told me these flowers are transferable if i took them i must win gold and then pass them on to someone else
5054078 i feel bad that it didnt go well i gave it my all but i want to feel that i didnt let my family down he promised his mother after the athens final he would deliver gold in beijing i gave everything i had
5054079 there are some things i still want to do to raise the bar a bit more in the world of swimming for me its still work in progress
5054080 im just so happy to put jamaica on the map no one expected me to win so there was no pressure
5054081 ive had some training in the different approaches to psychology but im hoping to learn more about the forms and other techniques here
5054082 its very interesting the way this center will work its just a movement to look at the whole person
5054083 in a doctors office you go to get an injury fixed or some pills
5054084 here we try to listen to people we look at the persons life from all angles physically emotionally spiritually
5054085 this clinic is going in a direction we havent gone before but if it proves successful i could see clinics in santa fe sandoval county farmington all over new mexico
5054086 one thing this offers on top of counseling and medication for problems like post traumatic stress disorders is that here they use a lot of stress reduction techniques massage therapies and other methods to help calm people down
5054087 it is our belief that net 3 5 in general and silverlight in particular will change programming more significantly than anything that has come from microsoft for a least a decade
5054088 once when i was training in baghdad a sniper opened fire on me there are many bombs when you are on the way to the stadium you dont know what will happen to you i will still continue my training and my sport when the sniper opened fire on me i went back and trained in the same place 30 minutes later i will continue my training even if there are snipers
5054089 oh too hard no time to train youll understand if you have kids
5054090 we thought this was a good opportunity the guys mentally were ready for the game
5054091 it was a big crowd a very vocal crowd and things fell really nicely for the chinese two corners two goals and then it was a game of catchup the whole way
5054092 theyre very well organised but sometimes its quite easy to read their structure because of that organisation
5054093 its actually a nice challenge to play against a side like that because theres a lot of repeatability in their game and some areas we can look to take advantage of
5054094 their personal skill is of a high standard so thats going to be one of the important match ups to win keep our personal skill level pretty high
5054095 i thought i was in the perfect position with 250m to go right behind arturo casado the spaniard but then he actually ran out of steam with 200m to go and everyone went by
5054096 i was like how do i get out of this position its sort of like pulling out in traffic to pass when someone else is coming youve got to check your rear view mirror otherwise youll get a blind spot
5054097 you lose your stride its like getting up from an ankle tap just getting your foot in front of you you lose your momentum and youve got to really regather your speed
5054098 i dont know whether its unsportsmanlike or not but for the first lap i was yelling at them come on guys pick up the pace weve got a chance to get seven guys through in this heat thats how pedestrian it was
5054099 it was the olympic games semi final so that was a pretty comical experience to realise i did that
5054100 awww this is just a guy bitching and moaning about how its not fair
5054101 its because people get to know us better find out so much more information about us giving us more exposure readers feel like they have a connection to us personally
5054102 sometimes theres a story you really want to write something you want to say and its so rare for fans to get the athletes perspectives on the competition what were thinking and feeling at the moment
5054103 those are the blog entries that get the most readers
5054104 ive been able to reach friends and family in peru and have received support from peruvians around the world
5054105 as an athlete thats what i need support from people around the world most comments i get come from the blogs about my personal experiences
5054106 lenovos goal with this blogger program is to give athletes a starting point for discussions and sharing of ideas and experiences about the olympic games
5054107 it isnt really a program about making millions of impressions in the traditional marketing sense its about making thousands of connections between athletes and fans
5054108 vamos a poner al d a al equipo nuestra meta es alcanzar un futbol alegre aunque reconoci que no ha podido repetir la alineaci n en el torneo apertura 2008 porque no hay continuidad de jugadores
5054109 el trabajo ha mejorado pero hay que darle la vuelta ver hacia delante este partido frente al atlante nos dar mucho material para el an lisis a fin de planear mejor los siguientes compromisos en espera de que ya llegue la victoria para los jaguares de chiapas
5054110 hubo mejor trabajo y manejo de la pelota pero falta pulir ciertos aspectos yo no creo en las buenas ni en las malas rachas creo en el trabajo y todos asumimos el compromiso de sacar las cosas de mejor manera
5054111 afortunadamente en los jaguares de chiapas hemos pedido que nadie se sienta suplente pero que tampoco se sienta titular al cien por ciento todos tenemos que trabajar el equipo no est bien es una situaci n complicada pero esperamos componer la situaci n muy pronto
5054112 no sirvi porque no alcanz para la victoria la realidad no se puede ocultar no hay desesperaci n pero s ansiedad por la victoria
5054113 nos vamos un poco inc modos por no haber alcanzado el objetivo
5054114 la disposici n la hubo sin embargo necesitamos trabajar para evitar los errores que como ahora nos puso desde los primeros minutos en desventaja en el partido
5054115 no hubo el futbol que nos gusta el equipo sali un poco dormido en el primer tiempo que aprovech bien el equipo local
5054116 do your homework know the community and dont feel obliged to use services such as ping fm to cover everything
5054117 this is just the beginning i feel im only scratching the surface of what can be extracted from existing syndication formats for example comment stream aggregation via the comments element or rfc 4685 autodiscovery is a great next step after this and i only call out friendfeed because theyre the best at aggregating multiple content sources but these concepts apply to any content aggregator and finding a way to reuse existing formats like rss and atom to create rich presentations automatically will enable us to do more with less manual work between aggregators and publishers

5054136 i would always remember going to class and i would see that he had a bill clinton anti campaign sticker on his car that says i dont miss bill no such bumper sticker was on the pickup he crashed in a police chase however
5054137 he would surf the internet and he would see that a democrat had died and he would laugh about it
5054138 there seems to be no reason to believe that johnsons actions were any more than a result of the unfortunate combination of a depressive personality and firearms

5054144 i didnt yell at them maam they were running through the department knocking clothes off the rack and i asked them to stop
5054145 dont yell at my kids thats not your job thats a parents job do you understand who do you think you are yelling at my kids i want to speak to your manager
5054146 yes a parents job to control your kids when theyre running around trashing the store terrorizing shoppers and being little menaces it doesnt matter that im a fucking idiot and do not control my kids its not your place to reprimand them reprimand thats another word for discipline you know busting their deserving asses instead of threatening with empty words

5054207 ya lo colapsar se dijo y se dispuso a botar el otro cp a la basura en ese preciso momento se percat que con el rabillo del ojo hab a visto algo no pod a precisar exactame nte lo que era pero fue suficiente como para detenerla en su intenci n tomo el papel que y el rea de cada una ser 1 8 del rea de mi tama o original tambi n
5054208 evidentemente el cuadrado es la base preliminar meditaba pandora que se convierte en la base bomba de agua que es triangular
5054209 pues claro all est la otra respuesta cada rayo del cp debe ser estructuralmente importante por lo tanto segu a concluyendo en un estado de claridad mental estos no son los cps de las bases tradicionales preliminar y bomba de agua pues estos cps tal como est n no representan figuras planas sino modelos tridimensionales
5054210 y ahora puedo ver claramente el por qu la leyenda dice un octavo del rea del cuadrado original
5054211 lo ves tu tambi n mi querido epimeteo consult con creciente entusiasmo a su m s que aburrido esposo lo ves

5054213 yet sadly although we know plenty about islamic paper making we know nothing whatsoever about arab and moorish paper folding now it may be that more information may come to light in the future but until it does we are not entitled to say that the arabs or the moors practised paper folding or that they brought it with them to spain any statement to the contrary is mere conjecture and not fact
5054214 cualquier afirmaci n sobre lo contrario sobre si los moros o los rabes doblaron papel es meramente una conjetura y no un hecho
5054215 entonces pude haber escogido cualquier otra soluci n y encontrar el polinomio respectivo

5054234 its not a sure thing in other words that an a la carte menu will end up giving us the widest possible array of choices
5054235 the transcontinental railroad was to the real estate of inland america as itunes is to the music marketplace of today
5054236 the event felt especially energetic since there were so many new ideas about distributing movies and connecting with audiences and lots of folks eager to hear those ideas
5054237 i decided that the only way to prevent yahoo from spoiling sports and other shows was to never go to their homepage hence no more yahoo search for me
5054238 hollywood believes large scale broadband video distribution would only destroy proven value fail to provide alternative value and alter a business model that is still far from being in decline with near total control of the most valuable program libraries and the business models governing their distribution a shift towards broadband media will come largely on hollywoods terms and at an incremental pace
5054239 although 180solutions has come to realize that third party distribution can be hard to police we believe it is possible to properly balance who we do business with while providing monetization methods for the long tail of web publishers and content developers
5054240 the advertisers benefit by repeat display of the name of their products google benefits because it does gets paid for the occasional click the cost is my inventory of space not googles so every click is gravy to google and every exposure is value to the advertiser in effect google is giving away exposures on my blog so that they can sell a few clicks which they will dutifully pay me for
5054241 when i came to this slide during my presentation in san jose i asked the audience how many were familiar with the long tail concept practically no one was yesterday the same thing happened with my chicago audience of about 300 people maybe 10 percent of the hands went up when i asked how many knew about the long tail
5054242 as the data indicates recommendation tools can provide important stimuli for increasing the diversity of music from genres to artists to which consumers are exposed recommendation tools can be a crucial component in driving demand for back catalogs as a source of high margin revenue for rights holders as well as toward niche artists and music that they otherwise would
5054243 on november 13 2005 google announced google analytics a free web analytics service targeted at the long tail of small and medium size businesses that lack a web analytics solution
5054244 the real issue for the studios is how they can dig into this potential gold mine without undermining their existing revenue streams
5054245 la times on the end of the mass moviegoing era
5054246 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
5054247 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues
5054248 bollywood tv says it has the internet rights to more than 730 indian films though at any one time on its site i have not seen more than 100 movies
5054249 1 every dollar coming out of print advertising revenue for newspapers is replaced by only 33 cents online 2 the largest 50 web companies are attracting 96 of the ad spending on line according to pricewaterhouse coopers with the majority going to aol google msn and yahoo
5054250 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
5054251 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings
5054252 search engines have the effect of counteracting the skewed distribution of links in the web directing some traffic toward sites that users would never visit otherwise
5054253 lets say that joss whedon creator of firefly wanted to bring the series back to air
5054254 the big companies have mostly finished their erp and crm implementations which is why oracle has been on a buying binge the action today is in small and medium sized businesses smbs from a service producers point of view how can we service smbs profitably on fairly short engagements with 1 or a few consultants and from the smbs point of view how can they add the it talent that they dont have in house in the short small doses when they need it
5054255 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
5054256 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it
5054257 indie films are typically made before they have u s distribution and with independent financing therefore the producer does not know when if ever the film will be released in theaters so unlike studio films independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign or used to recruit merchandising tie ins independent producers therefore have only a singular product the movie itself to find a distributor they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival at that point if the film is to succeed it must create its own audience through reviews awards and word of mouth so while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule an independent producer must keep re editing a film no matter how long it takes until the film works perfectly as a result independent films win much of the glory and awards and studio films win most of the gold taking in well over 80 percent of the box office proceeds
5054258 at a time when audiences are ebbing piracy is threatening profits and at home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie going equation a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable dvd players or reserved seats it may also be as close to a no risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared and a master to be copied and unlike traditional or even online distribution deals the filmmakers retain all the rights
5054259 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges
5054260 the majority of revenue in search is still made in popular searches rather than the tail in fact over 70 of search revenue is made on just 30 of the searches this shows both the stiff competition that exists for popular keywords and the upside that still exists for paid search as that competition spreads to the tail
5054261 three weeks ago sheffields arctic monkeys entered the uk charts at number one with their second single i bet you look good on the dancefloor they had just played their second london gig before an audience of 3 000 even by the hyper speed standards of modern rock and pop this was a remarkable rise apparently made possible only because the band had posted their songs on their website and thus built up a vast virtual fanbase before even securing a record deal
5054262 in the latest sign that the rules of television are being turned on their head the two divisions of time warner inc
5054263 but within their niche they dominate a site that ranks as number 100 000 in the overall web universe would still be the fifth largest within its niche big enough to throw some weight around furthermore niches have their own niches focusing on a highly targeted subtopic can make even a tiny site with a few hundred thousand page views stand out
5054264 the business is made much more complex by windows and audiences that are fragmenting
5054265 the story for the next 10 years is how content is going to adapt you wont find your audience in any one place anymore
5054266 allow people to buy stuff the way they want to so that you can wring every last cent out of your content by earning 1 from someone who isnt willing to spend 10 for the entire book perhaps someone will shortly suggest a subscription model for online books sign up for a membership plan and get to read as many books as you want or a specified monthly quota on your computer but without being able to download or print the books probably too easily hackable but much more appealing to me because it means having a potentially huge number of books available for actual reading on your desktop without even having to trudge down to the library
5054267 the executives at dmg still seem to be in the process of choosing a business model last year the company said it planned to beef up hiring so it could sign promote and market undiscovered artists in may it abruptly shifted gears laying off seven of its 15 workers and decided to focus on buying the rights of golden oldies also in the second quarter the company took a 75 000 writedown for a non recoverable advance it made to an unnamed recording artist
5054268 in 1976 punk broke onto the music scene and changed the rules of music music was democratized you didnt even need to be able to sing or know how to play music you just needed a guitar now blogging is having the same impact on publishing of course a lot of rubbish gets produced but some great gems get created too that wouldnt have normally been produced under the old system this is the era of punk publishing look around the blogosphere can you spot the sex pistols or the clash can you see a great entrepreneur like the one we got from that era richard branson
5054269 the obscure articles edited by a few authors that know about the subject are honestly some of the best in wikipedia i think as long as they are not about anything controversial usually they arent though or they would have more editors
5054270 i am wallowing in composers and works that i had never heard of svendsen vieuxtemps pitfield grieg other than the great piano concerto
5054271 the xbox which focuses on highly mature genres catering to hardcore gamers has production costs of 1 82 million a title the gamecube costs half as much at 822 000 a title the real kicker is that the nintendo ds only costs 338 286 a title to develop for even less than the gameboy some of these costs have to do with the hardware and development kits but for the most part they are derived from the scope of the projects being able to develop successful titles at 1 5th the cost of your competitors is a major boost to your bottom line
5054272 a great analogy to describe the potential impact of the long tail in book search is to consider the rapid rise of consumer created content online including blogs message boards ratings sites and other forms of social media these platforms are becoming incredibly influential not just because of their sheer popularity and compelling content but because they represent a massively growing share of online content relative to all other such as corporate commercial editorial and government content these more niche social media tend to place very prominently in search engines and therefore can achieve otherwise disproportionate exposure anyone responsible for the reputation of a big corporate brand is often kept up at night by that fact the little guys voice is being heard like never before loud and clear
5054273 id like to suggest that theres a 4th ascendant force 4 increasing opportunities to reuse content product service in new and more convenient contexts
5054274 if your posts have contextual advertising just because they dont earn any ad revenue right away does not mean that they will not give you a healthy return over several years make regular but relevant references to your older posts to help the long tail phenomenon on its way

5054278 one notion in particular might help mainstream companies the meme about the perpetual beta were so used to not releasing a product a service an idea until its fully baked but with the web 2 0 you have permission to play around with things to work on them as people are watching with the help of people

5054280 why is there such a long tail of programming languages in the community and is there an efficient way to satisfy the obvious need for more niche languages and promote the language innovation that happens in the long tail the first question is pretty easy to answer there is a long tail because the more specialized a language is to a domain the better it fits to solve problems for that domain these niche languages trade off generality for efficiency in a domain and they are simply better and more efficient tools for that domain the second question is a bit harder
5054281 bridging the digital divide is all about serving the longest tail by driving down price and driving up access and interoperability what is happening in massachusetts is the beginning of a global realization that governments have a productive obligation to serve the longest tail their citizenry by deploying open accessible standards not the technology of a single company
5054282 just one of a search engine spammers spam sites could have 30 000 pages

5054284 im working on an r amp d project at at amp t labs that employs an in house sampling algorithm that has been proven optimal in its ability to reduce yet retain accuracy of data that follows a heavy long tailed distribution were currently using this algorithm in a product that measures ip internet protocol traffic volumes which happen to follow the lt distribution in enormous networks im very interested in applying this technology to other lt distributions that can potentially benefit i e environments that produce lt distribution data in large volumes

5054290 new communication technologies and the lowered cost of participation they created allowed the linux movement to effectively harness a large and diverse wealth of programming power that would otherwise have been unavailable to it
5054291 a true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches where there are just one or even zero customers you need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers so what businesses fit this model the obvious one is ebay omidyars model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you dont find a buyer ebay takes a small listing fee but works better if you do ebay takes a percentage another example is cafepress they dont even set a listing fee working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them they aggregate sales and pay monthly

5054293 the complexity of the threat posed by open source warfare in iraq has accelerated the us militarys use of outsourcing traditionally the long tail has been used to describe the number of support personnel the tail required to support combat troops the tooth tooth to tail ratios have grown over the years as the complexity and resource intensity of modern combat has increased in essence modern warfare requires a loooong tail of support troops the us militarys tooth to tail ratio is approximately 1 to 10 or more
5054294 as in other domains this move towards distributed creation and production is being driven by more affordable and accessible tools of production the backwoods meth producer is a direct descendant of the backwoods hootch producer during the prohibition we may not like what they are producing but history has shown they will be quite creative in finding ways to produce it themselves the mit fab lab participant the remix dj at the local hip nightclub the extreme sports enthusiast and the backwoods meth producer all share a common passion producing goods and experiences on their own terms
5054295 consider postal service fulfillment of transactions made on the internet about two million prescriptions a day roughly one fifth of the total are delivered by first class mail ebays vendors list five million new items daily and those that are sold ship mainly by mail one pitney bowes study found that online retailers were increasingly using paper catalogs sent through the mail to steer people to their sites

5054299 to me this shows another crack in the traditional producer distribution audience models it is obvious that scholars and professionals were not the audience the two beethoven enthusiasts were first doing what they wanted to enjoy and couldnt find and now they are hoping to reach the mainstream in a way academicians and virtuosos cant as doc searls points out this is the demand side supplying itself
5054300 urban theorist jane jacobs observed many years ago that paradoxically huge cities create environments where small niches can flourish a store selling nothing but buttons most likely wont be able to find a market in a town of 50 000 people but in new york city theres an entire button store district subcultures thrive in big cities for this reason as well if you have idiosyncratic tastes youre much more likely to find someone who shares those tastes in a city of 9 million people
5054301 netflix makes it harder and harder for a customer to consider leaving the system for a competitor the more the user sees benefit from participation the more they give the more they give the less likely they are to leave even if there was a way to take your data to another service the system builds loyalty to the brand and the user experience that theyve spent time and energy learning
5054302 knowing that it would be difficult to match wal mart and best buys prices on the sale of new dvds without wreaking havoc on its margins blockbuster has instead decided to concentrate on the sales of used videos next year the company plans to make selling and trading used dvds and its video game operation priorities
5054303 in a world in which consumers can increasingly access precisely what they want on the device and in the location they chose for the price they want to pay the ability to use repackage and market content to meet users higher customization personalization and functionality standards gets you a lucrative seat at the big table but playing that game means changing relationships at every level of the media and entertainment supply and demand food chain from content distributors providers and producers as well as advertisers and marketers
5054304 in this new world of choice and control at the edges its the niches and those who can pull them together who win besides a universal top n00 list is even a bad execution of big media think when ad age gives you lists of magazine revenue it separates womens and entertainment and business publications in big media those pass as niches and they are far more valuable comparisons when talking about newspapers you dont lump in metro papers with town papers with trade papers its a meaningless lump when somebody can tell me who the queen of the knitting bloggers is then ill listen and so will knitting advertisers

5054309 radio and tv are going to have to adjust to a new economy the economy in which the long tail plays a major role
5054310 now you have paid online radio and free online radio paid online video and free online video at first the paid stuff is good and the free stuff is less good but soon producers seeking an audience start to make their stuff free because when they do the audience goes up 100x and then in order to compete others do the same thing wouldnt you if you had a touring band wouldnt you if you had already exhausted your dvd sales and wanted a big enough audience for your sequel
5054311 what about implicit events like the opening hours of the local go kart race track
5054312 the long tail approach to keywords advocates the use of
5054313 the movie studios to their credit use a form of dynamic pricing they intelligently recognize that a content items value is highest when first released and then subsequently fades the music labels have mostly avoided this strategy but perhaps thats changing i just noticed this little tidbit on amazon a long list of interesting cds for sale on amazon for between 6 and 10
5054314 we can study a culture by studying the differences in the power law approximated by the tag clouds used by people of that culture we could even measure cultural eartquakes by measuring the difference between the tag cloud being generated before and after a certain event

5054317 at the heart of ceo marc benioffs strategy is the idea that companies with deep industry knowledge will have more success creating their own specialized programs than salesforce could
5054318 microsoft and intel seem to think it is in their interest to cooperate with this approach and limit the ability of users to find new opportunities the long tail gets truncated its like cisco helping china control the spread of bad ideas
5054319 get your head out of your ass this isnt about giving away music this is about breaking bands people have to be exposed to the music somehow if you dont seed the system how will they
5054320 but amazon has a two pronged strategy to monetize the emergence of third party sellers and producers first it has acquired two companies booksurge and custom flicks to facilitate the direct publishing of books and movies which it can then sell second amazon is pushing third party sales via its web site and providing e commerce tools for large etailers 975 000 venders now sell on amazons site and 28 of amazons sales came from third party sellers in q2 up from 24 a year earlier
5054321 they want to get people innovating around their products to see what they can themselves produce to see where the market can go to get the early developers the people at the edges doing stuff which could potentially be mainstream because the people at the edges are are usually those ahead of the crowd
5054322 als kijkers gewone mensen zich op straat zien uitspreken over een nieuwsonderwerp denken ze oh die meneer vond het belangrijk dan is het voor mij waarschijnlijk ook relevant
5054323 mensen bleken associaties te hebben die niet direct met de kernboodschap van het nieuws te maken hadden
5054324 ze leggen links naar priv omstandigheden die vaak niet relevant lijken denken bijvoorbeeld bij een bericht over lerarentekorten aan een vriendin die ook in het onderwijs zit en die ze nodig weer eens moeten bellen in hetzelfde item kwam ook een meneer duif aan het woord wat bij n proefpersoon aanleiding was voor een gedachtestroom over pluk van de petteflet
5054325 wat helpt is nieuws dichter bij de kijker brengen dat kan op verschillende manieren voor veel mensen is de oorlog in georgi een ver van mijn bedshow sommigen weten niet eens hoe je georgi fatsoenlijk uitspreekt je zou mensen kunnen wijzen op de consequenties van het conflict een hogere gasrekening
5054326 het is onze taak een zo breed mogelijk publiek van nieuws te voorzien
5054327 nieuws blijft het beste hangen wanneer je de kijker uitlegt waarom het voor hem of haar belangrijk is we hebben geen opvoedkundige taak we schieten ons doel voorbij als de kijker afhaakt

5054364 it was incredible the amount of armed law enforcement personnel that were there
5054365 again it shows how we as indigenous peoples are living in oppression in this case we are oppressed by their law their legal ideology which is used to enforce the exploitation and continued oppression of the indigenous peoples they have the guns and the men to enforce their law even though we were on dakota land

5054377 designed and constructed to ensure proper conveyance of floodwaters and to eliminate the potential to cause backwater flooding on either side of the u s mexico border
5054378 the callousness displayed by homeland security in ignoring warnings to damage a national treasure is mind boggling
5054379 the contrast between the report findings and the environmental assessment displays the bush administrations wholly meaningless approach to environmental analysis
5054380 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
5054381 its time for homeland security to lift its embargo on environmental laws the border fence does not stop humans now we have more proof if the walls destruction of our national treasures
5054382 used the footage of tskhinvali which was literally ruined as a result of georgias attacks to make reports about the situation in the town of gori which the russian aviation supposedly bombed
5054383 what became the picture that mike jeremy of itn pegged one of the key images of the war in the former yugoslavia qtd in deichmann p 170 was in fact presented as to the western world as something it was not a concentration camp the focus was on fikret alic whos protruding rib cage behind a fence conjured up images of nazi death camps this death camp was a crude sick lie and fikret alic who survived the war was disturbed about the use of his image
5054384 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
5054385 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
5054386 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation

5054388 president kennedy was pilloried by the super patriots as a no win chief the far right became a fount of proposals born of frustration and put forward in the name of anti communism active duty commanders played host to anti communist seminars on their bases and attended or addressed right wing meetings elsewhere
5054389 could think of manufacturing something that would be generally acceptable
5054390 should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the cuban government as rash and irresponsible and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the western hemisphere
5054391 by manufacturing various pieces of evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the cubans
5054392 a series of well coordinated incidents to take place in and around
5054393 start riots near the main gate of the base others would pretend to be saboteurs inside the base ammunition would be blown up fires started aircraft sabotaged mortars fired at the base with damage to installations
5054394 we could blow up a u s ship in guantanamo bay and blame cuba
5054395 casualty lists in u s newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation
5054396 we could develop a communist cuban terror campaign in the miami area in other florida cities and even in washington
5054397 the terror campaign could be pointed at cuban refugees seeking haven in the united states we could sink a boatload of cubans en route to florida real or simulated we could foster attempts on lives of cuban refugees in the united states even to the extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized
5054398 create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the united states to jamaica guatemala panama or venezuela the destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross cuba the passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non scheduled flight
5054399 make it appear that communist cuban migs have destroyed a usaf aircraft over international waters in an unprovoked attack
5054400 that this responsibility for both oven and covert military operations be assigned to the joint chiefs of staff
5054401 the joint chiefs of staff believe that the cuban problem must be solved in the near future
5054402 further they see no prospect of early success in overthrowing the present communist regime either as a result of internal uprising or external political economic or psychological pressures accordingly they believe that military intervention by the united states will be required to overthrow the present communist regime
5054403 the joint chiefs of staff believe that the united states can undertake military intervention in cuba without risk of general war
5054404 they also believe that the intervention can be accomplished rapidly enough to minimize communist opportunities for solicitation of un action
5054405 t he joint chiefs of staff recommend that a national policy of early military intervention in cuba be adopted by the united states they also recommend that such intervention be undertaken as soon as possible and preferably before the release of national guard and reserve forces presently on active duty
5054406 i am the senior military my job to state what i believe and its his mcnamaras job to approve or disapprove
5054407 he gave general lemnitzer very short shrift and treated him like a schoolboy the general almost stood at attention when he came into the room everything was yes sir and no sir
5054408 we need a shake up of the joint chiefs of staff
5054409 we direly need a new chairman as well as new members
5054410 a contrived cuban attack on an oas organization of americas member could be set up
5054411 and the attacked state could be urged to take measures of self defense and request ice from the u s and oas the u s could almost certainly obtain necessary two thirds support among oas members for collective action against cuba
5054412 any of the contrived situations de above are inherently extremely risky in our democratic system in which security can be maintained after the fact with very great difficulty if the decision should be made to set up a contrived situation it be one in which participation by u s personnel is limited only to the most highly trusted covert personnel this suggests the infeasibility of the use of military units for any aspect of the contrived situation
5054413 the only area remaining for ration then would be to bribe one of castros subordinate commanders to initiate an attack on the u s naval base at guantanamo
5054414 a possible scenario whereby an attack on a united states reconnaissance aircraft could be exploited toward the end of effecting the removal of the castro regime
5054415 t he u s could undertake various measures designed to stimulate the cubans to provoke a new incident
5054416 flaunting our freedom of action hoping to stir the cuban military to action
5054417 depending above all on whether the cubans were or could be made to be trigger happy the development of the initial downing of a reconnaissance plane could lead at best to the elimination of castro perhaps to the removal of soviet troops and the installation of ground inspection in cuba or at the least to our demonstration of firmness on reconnaissance
5054418 we could blow up a u s ship in guantanamo bay and blame cuba casualty lists in u s newspapers cause a helpful wave of indignation

5054437 after a long deep breath i said maybe not but he would have been the first to defend my doing it that way and there is the sweet kernel of truth there is no one way one absolute dead certain way to do it but there are tests of whether and how the job of community journalism must be done
5054438 is it true and factual have i asked the right questions have i given the truth every chance to tell itself have i listened
5054439 the hardest part of community journalism is also the most rewarding part we live within what we write about either we know what we report or we are called on the carpet within hours if not minutes to account for our mistakes we look our stories in the face every day we meet them eye to eye and if we deny their humanity if we feel no compassion then we have failed to grasp the storys essence and will fail the storys telling
5054440 it is more difficult to practice ethical hard nosed journalism in smaller communities than it is in big cities we all know the reasons personal connections organizational obligations business pressures and so on but if community journalism is to be more than the red headed stepchild of our craft if it is to fulfill the promise of the first amendment for its readers viewers and listeners courage is essential and one thing the institute tries to do is lift up and exalt those community journalists who show courage in order to inspire other community journalists and to remind the journalism community at large about the special challenges that face journalists who try to make the first amendment a living document at the local level

5054576 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5054577 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5054578 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5054579 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5054580 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5054581 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough said dr erin michos co investigator for the study
5054582 its easy to see why people are so enthusiastic about the potential power of vitamin d but we must recognize the limitations of any study and exercise caution when making any broad public health recommendations said mary picciano a senior nutrition scientist at the nih who co authored a report on the conference published this month in the
5054583 theres still a lot we dont know about how vitamin d levels affect health especially across different age groups and ethnic populations picciano said
5054584 i dont know if im good enough i dont know if i want this
5054585 see a big part of being a fan is feeling like youve given your all just like the players have whether its through singing your heart out taking your last two days of holiday from work or foregoing sleep food or drink and thats just the matchgoing fans dontthink that us armchair fans dont also put ourselves through the wringer even if were only making the journey to the off licence or the local public house well be donning our lucky togs mines a plain red shirt and black footie socks since you ask lining up the lucky mascots and in the case of my friend lindsay making sure we sit on the sofa without our feet touching the ground throughout the entire match if she touches the carpet while the ball is in play a bizarre butterfly flaps its wings in taiwan chain reaction will cause the reds to sink to certain defeat no really its all about feeling like youve done your bit and even if you cant be there on the frontline if youve knitted a balaclava for the war effort you still feel part of it i cant claim im doing all that much tonight im inviting some mates round and making a special red white and black pizza for the occasion tomato mozzarella anchovies black olives its art dont question it but now i come to think about it maybe the stress of cooking will put me off my pre match routine buying a four pack of ale turning the miniature cantona mascot to face the screen placing my united tea mug on my old trafford mat not crossing my arms when a set piece is taken not looking if the opposition takes the kick off blinking three times before ronnie takes a free kick its a daunting task just remembering it all but if we win itll all be worth it and if we lose well ill feel like i did all i could actually come to think of it maybe chartering a last minute flight to moscow would have been the easier option all round

5054592 i hate my hands i hate you i hate the piano
5054593 he sat in the corner very quietly and at no point interfered there were a few nice occasions when id make suggestions and you could see the father smiling
5054594 the problem wasnt his attitude but the tone he set for other parents it became more competitive
5054595 weve made it clear weve posted signs that parents are welcome in our building but not upstairs in the studios or in rehearsals unless specifically invited by a faculty member they want to protect their own children but they also spy on others to compare talents
5054596 its something we have to deal with and hope that students understand that its very difficult to change the parents
5054597 we can only intervene when there is some action taken within the building
5054598 we checked in at the ticket counter and the woman said in a stern voice who is john anderson
5054599 god he must have gone through hell in his personal life to have dropped such a long way
5054600 he was quiet soft spoken and well respected he was not a bum
5054601 it was one of varians great successes wayne was a great mentor very helpful to me and he was doing really great stuff

5054609 we had a lot of fun this weekend celebrating our faith and praising the lord
5054610 people are different people have different chemistry they have different lives i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
5054611 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5054612 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment
5054613 we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin
5054614 ive often heard that science is capable of proving anything
5054615 its presenting a false picture of where public education is today
5054616 it is not acceptable no but it doesnt convey the right message about what is going on at that school either
5054617 go and found out how many 5a schools out there can call themselves recognized
5054618 the accountability system itself is based on your lowest performing group instead of on growth
5054619 to turn this on us as individuals how many of us honestly seek to know and learn what the different interpretations of god say in context and look at how that applies to our world and lives
5054620 its going to be pretty tough to top this feeling
5054621 this is all ive ever wanted in my life in the sport of fencing
5054622 you just have to stay close until the end and then send out keeth

5054628 dat waren de legendarische woorden die pim fortuin sprak over de toenmalige opdringerige verslaggeefster wouke van scherrenburg
5054629 if something like this is allowed to happen then there will be a worrying situation where many
5054630 we watched as russians blew up georgian coast guard ships today
5054631 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5054632 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5054633 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5054634 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5054635 technically being that we havent exactly seen two consecutive quarters of negative growth those half a million workers who have lost their jobs are whiners
5054636 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5054637 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states

5054648 if the ordinance is passed in its present form the people shall never know the criminal investigation report until the organisations publish it for the knowledge of people
5054649 as the government will fix remuneration for the officials of information commission the commission will become dependent on the government
5054650 nowhere in the world it had been mentioned that the reporter cannot write anything which will deteriorate the relationship between the country and the international organisation
5054651 we did not imagine that such an ordinance would be approved
5054652 there is no scope for playing hide and seek with it
5054653 it seems to the people that the anti graft drive is being conducted not against the real corrupt but against politicians
5054654 from the law and order point of view we have crushed the religious extremist groups though they often tried to regroup in sporadic manner
5054655 but for effective elimination of the group we still need to work to wage a social campaign engaging all stakeholders like religious and civil society leaders teachers and students
5054656 we have taken special precautions and put security agencies on high alert to keep the militants at bay
5054657 the security has been further tightened ahead of the muslim shab e barat night of fortune on saturday
5054658 the charge sheet will be presented in parliament by tuesday
5054659 whether he quits or counters the impeachment move will be decided after he sees the charges
5054660 the emissaries of musharraf are still in contact with the government and as far as we know musharrafs aides are advising him either to resign seeking an assurance for indemnity or try the supreme court
5054661 there is a long list of charges against himt we will file them by the latest by tuesday
5054662 there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5054663 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible
5054664 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5054665 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had
5054666 i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5054667 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5054668 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5054669 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
5054670 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honour to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it
5054671 the caretaker government should immediately free begum khaleda zia and start effective dialogue with her to overcome the present crisis
5054672 it is not possible for the caretaker government to unilaterally resolve the deepening crisis in the political arena
5054673 it is not possible for political parties to amend their party constitutions in such a short period of time under the emergency
5054674 we created the political intelligence operation pio to gather reports of what they political parties plan to do in advance
5054675 the pio will not only keep track of the activities by political parties and allied organisations but also have an overall responsibility to help ensure a peaceful public life
5054676 the main task of the police is to track down and punish criminals not to put a trail on political parties and their activities
5054677 such a move is possible only where politics is banned thats why we want political activities to be fully restored
5054678 we have exported vegetables to saudi arabia qatar abu dubai bahrain oman and some other middle eastern countries besides we also exported to united kingdom italy germany france greece and some other european countries
5054679 the freight fare charge for export of per kilogram of vegetable to the european market is tk 160 and tk 80 per kilogram to the middle east

5054685 im just so happy to eat this with you guys
5054686 an isaf unit on a mission to deny an insurgent safehaven has accidentally killed four civilians and wounded three others who were located inside a compound
5054687 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5054688 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time
5054689 she played such a big role in my life and was such an inspiration to me
5054690 she raised me as a young man for 13 years of my life i loved being around her i would go to school and rush home just to be around my mom
5054691 im very happy no 20 was available in houston i was going to have to go to my college number 5
5054692 hes got a lot to learn hes a kid getting into a grown mans game
5054693 they compared him and he accepted that but hes his own player
5054694 i guess its hard to hide from those comparisons when youre 6 foot 9
5054695 knowing him and his situation his background and the things hes been through im just happy to see him reach a lifetime goal
5054696 men det er sm penge vi har stadig ikke fundet de mange millioner

5054698 the last straw for the police was when a really good song came on a boom box that this guy was holding on his shoulder a few feet away from me the cops must have known that something sinister was taking place because there were at least 10 people dancing to the music then a cop grabbed the guy with the boom box by the back of his arm and yanked him into the street pushing him to the ground and making him loose grip of the stereo now i know that dancing is illegal and also a sin but i think there was excessive force used in this situation the stereo fell batteries flying everywhere and when a few of his friends picked it up a woman cop angrily lunged for the boom box and tried to further dismantle it
5054699 its just one game more but we did have this one circled
5054700 they are the world champs id be lying if i said we didnt have it circled
5054701 we want to make it hard on the other team
5054702 we can get a good shot any time down the floor
5054703 i said after the first couple of games that those shots were going to fall
5054704 when we create the tempo of the game defensively like that and then shoot this way we have a good chance to win
5054705 he might be the best transition player in the tournament
5054706 im a much better player now i was too young then i had never been in the playoffs and i had never really been in any big nba games
5054707 ooh i should probably finally bring the bag and other assorted items to the thrift store its only been sitting there for 4 weeks
5054708 clutter accumulates when energy stagnates and likewise energy stagnates when clutter accumulates so the clutter begins as a symptom of what is happening with you in your life and then becomes part of the problem itself because of the more of it you have the more stagnant energy it attracts to itself
5054709 if you somehow get your life moving again you will instinctively want to clear the clutter out of your home and make a fresh start
5054710 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5054711 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5054712 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5054713 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5054714 mobile tv services have taken off in where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5054715 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off

5054718 along comes mccain who not only has he doesnt like to talk about his religion very much and then he talks about it openly but he has a very powerful story thats emotionally connected to the audience
5054719 its the candidate who can connect emotionally to middle america who will have the big advantage going down the stretch
5054720 it was far less about religion and a lot more about values
5054721 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
5054722 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5054723 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
5054724 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
5054725 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5054726 john mccains going to be a much tougher opponent for barack obama in the debates than anybody ever might have imagined just a few weeks ago
5054727 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
5054728 hes a man of few words but when he tells stories he connects
5054729 i thought barack obamas answer tonight was helpful to him and addressed a couple of things because theres been a lot of doubt about his christian faith
5054730 i think he also helped to dispel the myth that hes such an elitist and hes arrogant he was quite humble in that answer and many others
5054731 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
5054732 those are the judges that the evangelicals that social conservative voters want to hear from john mccains own lips that he opposes and that he would not support because the issue of judges is perhaps one of the most if not the most important issue for many social conservatives
5054733 the voters out there who went out in large numbers for george w bush that is one of the things that they want to hear from john mccain because that is something that gives them a lot more faith in john mccain
5054734 that hes not going to make the same mistake another republican president made
5054735 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5054736 you can make these up to one week in advance
5054737 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5054738 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5054739 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving

5054742 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5054743 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5054744 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services
5054745 a year from today well still be talking about financial problems its not going away
5054746 in many areas with large concentrations of foreclosure sales homes are being purchased below replacement cost values
5054747 many buyers with long term expectations are getting exceptional value in the current market once the inventory is drawn down price pressure will return because the costs of construction are rising todays buyers are very well positioned to build wealth over time
5054748 the biggest home sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
5054749 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
5054750 each of these areas has seen a strong buyer response in recent months to the big cuts in home prices
5054751 areas with affordable housing and healthy local economies continue to see price growth
5054752 prices having fallen sharply and quickly in very distressed markets but most or all of the price declines may have already occurred in these areas since buyers have now returned to those markets
5054753 furthermore the momentum of buying is likely to continue in light of the housing stimulus package that was recently enacted about 2 5 million first time buyers are expected to take advantage of the 7 500 tax credit between now and the middle of next year

5054757 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5054758 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5054759 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5054760 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5054761 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5054762 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5054763 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5054764 if it is a stonewall penalty which everybody says it is then i feel really harshly treated
5054765 its a big laugh the wages these guys get its not even on the radar for us
5054766 i just want to see how he plays how he adapts to our defense and if he has problems with certain things im just curious to see how he plays really
5054767 you got to take care of this to move on
5054768 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5054769 they hit a lot of 3s and love to drive and kickout for the open shot
5054770 i just happen to be in the right place at the right time
5054771 i actually thought that i missed a lot of shots early that i usually hit
5054772 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5054773 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5054774 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5054775 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5054776 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5054777 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5054778 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5054779 its slightly absurd and playful to conceive of this kind of space in old street
5054780 it is an optimistic project not a manifesto but lighthearted and fun
5054781 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right

5054784 i believe in equality and that the world has too much hate
5054785 dont criticize them we would be exactly as they are if we had lived in similar circumstances
5054786 hi but shes not at mg already p shes on her way back i think
5054787 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5054788 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5054789 sometimes guys just have off years i think that happens its a part of the game hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5054790 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5054791 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5054792 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5054793 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important
5054794 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5054795 we attempted to do so by the trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5054796 i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5054797 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5054798 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5054799 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5054800 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5054801 obviously ive been the no 1 european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5054802 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week
5054803 its such a high in my career it very easily could be the last high and many players have failed at this point in the past
5054804 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5054805 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5054806 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5054807 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5054808 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5054809 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5054810 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5054811 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5054812 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5054813 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5054814 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5054815 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5054816 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5054817 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5054818 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5054819 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5054820 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5054821 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5054822 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5054823 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5054824 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5054825 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5054826 i shot a great match its just a crazy thing that happens
5054827 just worrying about calming myself down and just breaking a good shot and so i didnt even look at the number
5054828 the way i come into a target is i start above the target and come down from 12 oclock and get into the
5054829 and as i get down into the is when i start to get on the trigger
5054830 as i was starting to get on the trigger the gun just went off
5054831 i was like uh thats not going to be good
5054832 hes definitely the best standing shooter out there if he can still end up fourth with a 4 4 on the last shot thats a hell of a shooter
5054833 hearing the spectators cheering i felt maybe i got the silver but my coach told me i got the gold
5054834 but the name is hard to remember to me he looks like a big strong horse
5054835 i start work early every day and i dont watch television
5054836 i think phelps is becoming a big name here quickly and a famous name is easier to remember even if its foreign
5054837 i watched the race and saw him with his mother they look like a good family
5054838 when he won his first or second medal he looked so confident
5054839 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
5054840 everything had to go perfect everything had to fall perfectly into place and i was able to have probably the best week of my life
5054841 i looked up and i saw kobe and lebron the best basketball players in the world and i love basketball
5054842 i thought theres no way i was going to let those guys down
5054843 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5054844 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
5054845 just look like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
5054846 yall know me know how i earn a livin ill catch this bird for you but it aint gonna be easy bad fish not like going down to the pond and chasing bluegills and tommycocks this shark swallow you whole no shakin no tenderizin down you go and we gotta do it quick thatll bring back your tourists put all your businesses on a payin basis but its not gonna be pleasant i value my neck a lot more than three thousand bucks chief ill find him for three but ill catch him and kill him for ten but youve gotta make up your minds if you want to stay alive then ante up if you want to play it cheap be on welfare the whole winter i dont want no volunteers i dont want no mates theres too many captains on this island ten thousand dollars for me by myself for that you get the head the tail the whole damn thing
5054847 what wouuuuld you doooo if i saaaaang out of tuuuune
5054848 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5054849 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5054850 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services
5054851 a year from today well still be talking about financial problems its not going away
5054852 ich machs wie der liebe gott der l sst sich auch nicht so oft blicken hat aber trotzdem ein gutes image
5054853 ich glaube dass der so genannte faith factor also die rolle der religion eine erhebliche rolle in dem wahlkampf eh und je gespielt hat was nicht weiter verwundert wenn man bedenkt dass ja die vereinigten staaten sich stets als auserw hlte nation als gottes eigenes land definiert haben und das hat sich dann nat rlich auch in den wahlk mpfen niedergeschlagen
5054854 auf der einen seite haben wir mccain den republikaner der bei den religi sen rechten nicht gut gelitten ist aufgrund der tatsache dass er in den social issues relativ liberale positionen eingenommen hat auf der anderen seite haben wir obama dessen geistiger ziehvater der pastor wright als evangelischer sektenprediger einige ungeschicklichkeiten begangen hat die auf obama zur ckgeschlagen haben von daher sind glaube ich beide kandidaten mit gewissen makeln behaftet in sachen religiosit t
5054855 ich habe mich seit 25 jahren im kongress im senat und als pr sidentschaftskandidat der usa entschieden f r das leben und gegen abtreibung eingesetzt ich werde ein pr sident f r den lebensschutz ungeborener sein und meine pr sidentschaft wird durch eine politik gegen abtreibung gepr gt sein das ist mein bekenntnis
5054856 f r mich ist jetzt die herausforderung wie verringern wir die zahl der abtreibungen denn tatsache ist dass die zahl nicht zur ckgeht wie stellen wir hilfen zur verf gung die den frauen erm glichen ein kind auszutragen

5054863 so far the knee is good and well make a decision tomorrow
5054864 im very happy definitely happy and the only thing left is do whatever i can to help the team
5054865 ill just have to try and see what happens but im sure ill be able to help the team
5054866 i had some doubts as far as the surgery but as far as making the decision to try and make it back i had no doubts
5054867 the short summer break after the race in budapest has benefited everyone now we are embarking on the remaining three european races and four overseas gps with renewed vigour
5054868 our aim is to continue on from the good results of the first half of the season we still have a few arrows in our quiver and we aim to land one or other hit
5054869 the european grand prix around the port area of valencia is new to the programme this year we are very much looking forward to the race and the city particularly as bmw has some close associations with valencia
5054870 the formula bmw racing centre there serves as the training site for our up and coming young talent in the formula bmw series around the world valencia is by tradition the venue for rolling out our new f1 cars too and beyond that city races always make for a unique atmosphere we await the new circuit with keen anticipation
5054871 we wanted to enjoy ourselves while also raising money and awareness about what we do
5054872 one of my favourite fun categories in the dog show was the best six legs which included both the dogs and its owners
5054873 it was the first time that we have ever organised a dog show in the city and it was a great success with more than 150 people attending over the afternoon
5054874 the show also enabled us to raise much needed funds for the dogs home while also letting people know about some of the services we offer such as microchipping and neutering
5054875 it has been a fantastic event which has given dog owners the chance to meet and enjoy themselves
5054876 and i also believe that it is a great idea for members of the gay and lesbian community to forge a link with the dogs home in this way
5054877 my sincere hope is that this will now become an annual part of the manchester pride celebrations

5054882 the advertising campaign concept was based on the fact that the actor has russian roots
5054883 looking for the face he had before the world was made
5054884 the big western debate is whether this is about georgia or russia
5054885 those who want to contain the damage say that georgia is a little country partly to blame and not worth the confrontation with moscow then there are those who say this is really about russia and the rules of the game for europe writ large for the caspian energy corridor and the right of small countries to choose their own path
5054886 how do they square their increasing energy dependence on russia with their increasing political discomfort with putin its a very hard circle to square
5054887 will only be reinforced in its view that georgia and ukraine are not ready for nato
5054888 there is little disagreement now in europe about the nature of the new russia
5054889 europe is torn between old and new europe but i dont see europe prepared to go to war with itself over georgia the european foreign ministers sense this is too big for them and they will in the end align themselves with the united states while trying to affect policy

5054891 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5054892 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
5054893 from filigree to hammered pieces this designer knows how to add delicacy to
5054894 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5054895 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5054896 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5054897 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5054898 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5054899 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5054900 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5054901 a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5054902 we are thrilled that the judge did not require us to continue to engage in the folly of purchasing a 4 2 million condo at a time when we should be considering other matters
5054903 we believe the court injected a dose of reality into a contested litigation and feel that we have started down the road to resolution
5054904 you know yall were like let me get four tickets to the funeral hes still the hottest ticket in town
5054905 it was a pretty amazing scene jen was sitting at a table inside and then suddenly courteney cox walked in

5054912 government has been the voice of big business not small business
5054913 voters dont like bad behavior on the part of ceos but economic populism really doesnt work
5054914 and both guys have to show leadership on the economy
5054915 they have to be seen as thoughtful responsible stewards of economic policy who can get along with business and talk to business
5054916 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5054917 a womans ability to decide how many children to have and when without interference from the government is one of the most fundamental rights we possess it is not just an issue of choice but equality and opportunity for all women
5054918 i have consistently advocated for reproductive choice and will make preserving womens rights under roe v wade a priority as president i oppose any constitutional amendment to overturn the supreme courts ruling in this case
5054919 acho que ficou uma mensagem de que quando existe uma na o n o importa se ana paula larissa ou shelda
5054920 cheguei para jogar com uma pessoa que eu n o conhecia e saio daqui com uma amiga ela j tem uma torcedora para os jogos de 2012 foram muitas coisas boas nestes dias que eu estive aqui foi um turbilh o de emo es tentamos nos conhecer a tapas e descobri uma pessoa que eu nem imaginava
5054921 amadureci muito com a ana paula aprendi o que disputar uma olimp ada conseguimos formar um bom time em uma semana e apresentar um bom n vel de jogo ela se mostrou companheira at o final
5054922 no pr ximo ano eu te espero juliana e a n s vamos formar uma dupla bem mais consistente
5054923 completely consistent with his record of supporting our allies in a very tough region of the world
5054924 hes been a leader on this issue for a very long time
5054925 this little country was prospering its a democracy its a freely elected government
5054926 what were seeing now is a gross violation of everything we stand for and believe in

5054929 i had a little bit of hope inside of me
5054930 but seeing how beautifully she executed her routine i knew
5054931 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
5054932 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5054933 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5054934 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
5054935 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
5054936 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days
5054937 im sure someday ill appreciate what i did i still have to get to that step
5054938 it is amazing to go to three olympics and get three medals
5054939 i was nervous when i was watching the other gymnasts competing after me
5054940 this is a competition so two or three mistakes are pretty common i was struggling during those 10 minutes i was worried that i wouldnt get the gold medal

5054945 the last straw for the police was when a really good song came on a boom box that this guy was holding on his shoulder a few feet away from me the cops must have known that something sinister was taking place because there were at least 10 people dancing to the music then a cop grabbed the guy with the boom box by the back of his arm and yanked him into the street pushing him to the ground and making him loose grip of the stereo now i know that dancing is illegal and also a sin but i think there was excessive force used in this situation the stereo fell batteries flying everywhere and when a few of his friends picked it up a woman cop angrily lunged for the boom box and tried to further dismantle it
5054946 what is it about evolution theory that albertans dont get
5054947 a shockingly low 37 per cent of albertans supported the position that humans beings evolved from less advanced life forms over millions of years
5054948 an even greater number of albertans 40 percent agreed that humans were created by god within the last 10 000 years

5054957 we sought to amalgamate with another club to secure the viability of our clubs future and the board unanimously voted in favour of going in this direction
5054958 we were not generating enough revenue to keep the club viable and our accountant advised us to look at our options
5054959 we want to improve the club the course and facilities for our members and that is the only reason we are amalgamating
5054960 after a feasibility study it was revealed the golf club is a sound investment for us
5054961 while the golf club has traded at a loss in previous years the cash flow position is positive and we believe that with good planning it can continue to be a great asset for the community to enjoy
5054962 it doesnt make any sense to me that they would kill off their greatest tourist asset to do this redevelopment if they intended to keep it as a tourist caravan park
5054963 it is very stressful to all residents in the park
5054964 there is no shared project happening concerning the reserve at this point in time and there is no commitment either from the council
5054965 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5054966 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion

5054970 a review of this matter by councils recently appointed solicitors and with the benefit of additional information provided by the applicant it is now considered that characterisation of the supermarket as a general store would be appropriate
5054971 i have now formed a view that council should not continue to argue against the proposal and that it proceed to the development assessment panel
5054972 the crux of the matter was whether or not the supermarket was properly categorised or characterised as a general store
5054973 further legal advice has been received and some additional information from the applicant that it is best categorised as a general store
5054974 this has happened a number of times this season and it really affects the players ability on the field
5054975 especially with games like cricket the rivets can cause a player to get a ball in the face if it bounces the wrong way
5054976 cable one customers opted in to our monitoring of their internet usage and content consistent with this third party test when they agreed to our aup
5054977 because doing so would stifle our ability to test new technologies that have the potential to offer significant benefits to our customers
5054978 a comprehensive federal privacy law that would accomplish several goals such as building consumer trust and protections

5054980 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
5054981 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
5054982 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
5054983 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
5054984 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
5054985 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
5054986 and by moral values i mean that a mans duty to make love requires him to think not about what his own body wants but the responsibility he has to care about his wife and her feelings its an act of love
5054987 not just the search for someone you take a liking to this is the search for the person you can pair up with and then go out and take on the world the partner who really fits you
5054988 for secular israelis this has become a day to celebrate with parties music dancing this has upset many of the rabbis who believe that to celebrate in this way is a misreading of the texts
5054989 i think this is a day when people are proud to say they are jewish whether they are secular or not
5054990 jewish attitudes towards sex are very different to christianitys we believe that we should enjoy all of the fruits that god gives us the christian view of sex leans more towards repressing those feelings i think we encourage a more open view of sex within marriage than christians
5054991 the christian view seems to be that sex is an unfortunate fact of life but for jews this is an opportunity that god gives every couple
5054992 for us it is a fact of life and we have to be able to prove that we are worthy of expressing those moral values

5055001 when some people said its not possible and it cant be done i think thats when my imagination came into play
5055002 and i thought i had a chance to do it coach bob bowman and i talked about it and we were able to get here through a lot of hard work its been fun
5055003 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
5055004 hes not from another planet he from the future his father made him and made a time machine sixty years from now hes just an average swimmer but he has come back to this time to mop up
5055005 he is the greatest sportsman ever to walk the planet
5055006 just a normal person but he is maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
5055007 he doesnt want to just beat you he wants to destroy you
5055008 well never really know the answer to questions like that
5055009 but however you rank them michael cant be far down the list
5055010 there is no historical precedent for what he has accomplished how he is accomplishing it his body of work you have at once a supremely gifted athlete with a willingness to endure unmatched levels of preparation plus hes a fantastic competitor mentally tough and someone who appears to get even better in the face of a tough challenge
5055011 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
5055012 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
5055013 i hate to compare swimmers to players in the nba or nfl
5055014 but i will say that theres nobody in any sport that can win like he wins hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the field
5055015 we are breaking records that are 20 30 and nearly 50 years old
5055016 islam maldives are promoted via a false glossy outside while actually putrid on the inside

5055018 sci fi is our umbrella brand for casual and online gaming in the uk and other countries outside the usa science fiction and fantasy fans have a huge affinity with gaming and our relationship with bigpoint will allow us to take advantage of growing popularity of multiple players
5055019 were pleased that were working with sci fi uk on our first collaboration following our agreement with nbc universal in june there is a perfect fit between our audiences and we look forward to extending this relationship with both sci fi and nbc universal in the future
5055020 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5055021 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about

5055025 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party

5055027 howard deans comments on race and gender today are disappointing and wrong
5055028 his efforts to divide americans are an insult to all our nations citizens and have absolutely no place in the national dialogue
5055029 a pretty monolithic party they all behave the same they all look the same its pretty much a white christian party
5055030 it is an honour to know that our game is enjoyed by so many people from different backgrounds
5055031 from top professional players to football enthusiasts and kids who just want a kickabout in the streets its appeal is widening all the time the new become a legend and legends modes are designed to convey the pressure and pace a real pro experiences with players working as part of a strong side and working to prove their merit as a player i feel great and motivated when people enjoy our games and feel the new modes will open up new ways to enjoy pes
5055032 we have pulled out all the stops to make pes 2009 a landmark in footballing games
5055033 from the most basic controls through to the wide ranging additions to game modes such as become a legend all new visuals sound and the edit mode seabass and his team have strived to cram as much as they can into the new game and with more online announcements to follow there is every reason to believe that pes 2009 is the football game everyone has been waiting for

5055037 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5055038 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5055039 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5055040 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5055041 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5055042 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5055043 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5055044 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5055045 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5055046 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5055047 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5055048 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine

5055051 well you guys did it so we get to do it
5055052 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs
5055053 as i learned when i tried for an ncaa championship in 1974 sports are not worth anything with bush nazis in the works

5055059 be sure hes wearing his gold medals you could say you won them champion sh t eater champion ss picker champion sh thead etc
5055060 on the other hand dumb boy could just bomb beijing and claim all the gold medals he would be the ultimate olympian he would even win the medals for team sports for they would have to forfeit the games these bush nazis can do anything that they put their sh t eaten brains to
5055061 he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears or sees and he will tell you what is yet to come

5055064 oh that that was dreamed up by someone munching turds on the toilet
5055065 i wrote in 98 that david wolf was the one to take over and get davids house of jacob built
5055066 let god hurry and do his work so we can see it
5055067 nothings going to happen no body is going to do nothing about it

5055069 look you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless hear o earth i am bringing disaster on this people the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words
5055070 its just a little bit its not going to kill you
5055071 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house
5055072 these are the sh theads you want listen to them they talk like idiots
5055073 let god hurry and do his work so we can see it
5055074 let me take you down cause im going to strawberry fields

5055080 to the legislature or to the ballot box not to the judiciary
5055081 the old fights of state against nation were largely smoke screens to hide an attempt by some private interest to invoke the aid of the court in combating public regulation in large measure this is the case today
5055082 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
5055083 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

5055085 rank with overfishing habitat loss and harmful algal blooms as global environmental problems
5055086 shows that there is a lot of lost production of seafloor animals those living in the sediments that could be food
5055087 in the recent years of increased acreage of corn and biofuels the amount of fertilizer used and the amount of nitrogen per volume of mississippi river water has increased dramatically
5055088 what we have is this pulse of nutrients that are coming down our rivers every year
5055089 somehow we have to find a way to stop that
5055090 the loss of fertilizer is an economic drain on the industry it is not something the farming community wants to happen and controlling it is the key to controlling the spread of dead zones
5055091 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
5055092 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
5055093 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
5055094 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
5055095 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
5055096 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
5055097 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
5055098 although its more like a one two three four punch
5055099 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
5055100 other studies mostly just look at one aspect the carbon capture
5055101 this is a first step in trying to quantify the environmental trade offs
5055102 the decision to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions is going to be intertwined with decisions about how to deal with these other emissions
5055103 people are turning their attention to this which is great
5055104 everyone was thinking what are the environmental benefits of carbon capture not so much the environmental costs
5055105 how do the few control the many and what might be done about it

5055113 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice
5055114 he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5055115 mengutamakan perpaduan dan perpaduan dan lebih banyak isu isu lebih utama yang perlu ditangani
5055116 all this puts microsoft in the awkward position of having its brand image defined by a rival despite its own vast advertising budget which towers above apples
5055117 seeing 8 8 08 and the opening ceremonies starting at 8 i guess it was maybe meant to be
5055118 its one of the greatest things sport in general has ever seen
5055119 is that other athletes are not going to realize how hard what he did is
5055120 the world is fast at swimming now the world was not fast when mark spitz did his seven
5055121 its endurance its strength its pressure he made the pressure putt in the u s open he won the tour de france and he knocked out the best fighter in the world in the 16th round with an uppercut
5055122 he did absolutely everything sport is supposed to be and he did it with a smile on his face and hes a good kid
5055123 the only thing that i would have wanted to change
5055124 was the 200 fly i think i can go faster in that event it was a wardrobe malfunction but it was something we took care of and we were able to fix
5055125 other than that i think this was a perfect week
5055126 hes beginning to set a whole new standard for his sport and for america
5055127 the united states olympic committee is very proud of him as is usa swimming and basically every citizen in our country and in many other countries
5055128 hes a true athlete and represents whats best about the olympic movement

5055130 weve been living in florida now for 10 years so we need to get some stuff together but were not going to rush out of here
5055131 weve got to get back and buckle up our own house
5055132 russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody
5055133 im not quite sure why this deputy chief of staff felt compelled to make those kinds of threats
5055134 we just want those in russia who seem to be willing to look to the future people perhaps like president dmitry medvedev to perhaps begin to exercise more influence here and get some of these peoples rhetoric under control
5055135 we have agreed along with our partners in poland and the czech republic to give the russians access both physical and technical access so they know whats going on every step of the way
5055136 weve agreed not to even make the interceptors operational until the iranians have test launched a missile that has the range to hit much of western europe not to mention russia so this is really an old song that theyre singing and it really just doesnt play
5055137 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority

5055164 why is cbc paying attention to michael phelps well hes possibly the greatest amateur athlete of all time and the biggest story of the olympics
5055165 phelps is amazing this guy is dominating his sport like no other like wayne gretzky and michael jordan in their day
5055166 michael phelps is the worlds best swimmer right now and he is on the verge of fulfilling a great achievement

5055171 the fate of south ossetia must be decided by the people of south ossetia they live in very difficult conditions and the context of what has happened is quite complex
5055172 should south ossetia preserve its present status of a de facto independent state
5055173 what does separatism mean anyway it means you want to separate and who do we want to separate from from murderers
5055174 a court will allow her to leave him people say we are abkhazian separatists but this means what are we supposed to be georgians we have nothing in common with them
5055175 this is a very hard situation for which we were absolutely unprepared

5055255 seit laguna seca habe ich etwas ruhe bekommen und wieder mit dem training begonnen um eine bestm gliche verfassung zu erreichen obwohl ich noch nicht wieder bei 100 prozent bin konnte ich das ganze wochenende ber angreifen
5055256 ich bin immer fr hlich wenn wir ein gutes ergebnis einfahren und heute bin ich so richtig gl cklich
5055257 das podium ist eine tolle belohnung f r seinen einsatz und f r seine crew die so hart daran gearbeitet hat uns nach vorne zu bringen
5055258 anfangs sah es so aus als h tte chris die chance auf das podium zu gelangen doch es sollte nicht sein
5055259 die bedingungen unterschieden sich vom freitagnachmittag und leider haben beide darunter gelitten chris etwas mehr das hat es f r ihn schwierig gemacht im rennen eine konstante pace zu gehen nichtsdestotrotz hat er sich gut darauf eingestellt und er kam wieder in die top 6 seine leistung an diesem wochenende war erneut sehr stark und konstant
5055260 ich hatte einen guten start legte mich mit den kawasakis an und wurde etwas aufgehalten ich konnte west berholen und habe angefangen hopkins anzugreifen dabei bekam ich allerdings probleme mit dem grip an der front und musste den fahrstil ndern als ich an hopkins vorbei war hatte ich das gef hl als sei nichts mehr brig und die situation verschlimmerte sich noch das war eine ble geschichte denn zu diesem zeitpunkt war das rennen sieben runden alt
5055261 ich habe den kopf eingezogen und habe versucht die bestm gliche haltung zu finden um den reifen zu schonen einmal habe ich dar ber nachgedacht in die box zu fahren ich habe aber durchgehalten und das motorrad auf dem sechsten rang ins ziel gebracht ein paar punkte gemacht

5055264 its a huge blow to valeri and to the team just prior to kick off the likelihood is that he is going to be out for six months as he has ruptured his right achilles tendon its a terrible blow for him after the injury worries he has had over the last 12 months he did really well to come back and he deserved his place in the team today
5055265 i thought we were well in the game and when we got back on level terms i felt that we were in the ascendancy and that we were going to go on from that
5055266 unfortunately we invited pressure on ourselves made poor decisions in key areas and were not able to recover all the hard work evaporated in those eight minutes and the game went away from us
5055267 i think people saw an improvement from thursdays uefa cup defeat you have to sustain a performance from the first minute to the last we didnt so for an eight minute spell and it has cost us the game thats the level we play at you are up against good strikers and a lapse will cost you
5055268 i dont think the scoreline is a reflection on how we played it hurts at the moment but we will pick ourselves up for a big game next weekend

5055300 call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures
5055301 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
5055302 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
5055303 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
5055304 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
5055305 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
5055306 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
5055307 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
5055308 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
5055309 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
5055310 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
5055311 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
5055312 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
5055313 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
5055314 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
5055315 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
5055316 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
5055317 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
5055318 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
5055319 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
5055320 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
5055321 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
5055322 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
5055323 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
5055324 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
5055325 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
5055326 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
5055327 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
5055328 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
5055329 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
5055330 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
5055331 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
5055332 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
5055333 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack
5055334 escalating tensions that would peak with an iranian inspired insurgency strike against us

5055348 the paradox is that while african american and hispanic women have a lower coverall venture for boob cancer they have a higher mortality which is belike due to the higher incidence of triple negative disease
5055349 so in constituent to the usual surgery that every women undergo these triple negative women are not eligible to obtain some hormonal therapy
5055350 this leaves them with exclusive chemotherapy to treat a very battleful form of boob cancer and though triple negative patients move well to chemotherapy they recidivate and their survival is shortened
5055351 whats important to state is that boob cancer is not a azygos disease and even teen women crapper get it
5055352 why african american and hispanic women get this very battleful form more ofttimes we rattling dont know it may be due to genetics socioeconomic status or in conception due to barriers to treatment its belike an interaction of every of them its understandably an atlantic for further research
5055353 studies like this are worthwhile and help us understand venture factors more clearly but its also an issue of debate whether estrogen and progestogen receptors and her2 are fundamental unchanging characteristics of a tumor or whether their status actually changes and they lose their ability to move over time
5055354 if you feature some tumors are only destined to be perverse from the start then you have to saucer to some genetic susceptibleness to explain it
5055355 but if you think tumors crapper modify with time then it could be that destined socioeconomic groups get diagnosed with a more battleful type of cancer only because of diagnosis delays due to health care barriers whether or not this is so is not still rattling understood

5055397 these are the last few months ill ever have to indulge my youthful passions
5055398 if you are not in computer science and not a first class graduate there is nothing we need to talk about
5055399 which other profession requires you to shuttle from hotel room to hotel room
5055400 i think youd be perfect to help work on our port project out in saudi arabia
5055401 we spend all our youth chasing money and when we attain it we spend all our money chasing youth
5055402 in some parts the water had reached waist level and we wanted to ensure that nobody was stranded in their homes
5055403 ni waters major incident response team has been convened and more than fifty teams have been dispatched throughout northern ireland to respond to problems
5055404 he always told me that he thought school was a waste of time
5055405 were feeling really happy and were really at peace now because youre always a little bit nervous before it all takes place
5055406 were really proud of the boys for having worked so hard and having achieved their goal
5055407 when we saw that they started out in that first 500 metres they had a good start i think one of their best speeds we were feeling i think pretty confident that they would be able to do it
5055408 our speaker got up and just praised brian we were all excited about it
5055409 she was almost running on the spot she was so excited
5055410 weve been very much praying for him and his team
5055411 she was yelling and they were all screaming in the background and they were having a great time and totally celebrating and taking it all in
5055412 they were a much much stronger boat this year theyre such a solid group and theyre determined thats all it takes
5055413 we know its a lot of stress and anything can happen for him to hang on and have a little bit of kick left in there is just incredible it was just an amazing outcome we couldnt be happier for him
5055414 keeping the extremely fragile spare bulb near the front of the bathroom cabinet and the lysol just behind it is a bad idea
5055415 die debatte wurde jetzt losgetreten damit die leute csu w hlen
5055416 das ding mit der pauschale l uft richtig gut f r uns
5055417 genau in dem moment als die energiepreise explodierten habe ich im interview am ostersonntag die alte pauschale gefordert
5055418 konnte ja keiner ahnen dass das thema so einschl gt aber manchmal hat man eben gl ck und schlau wie wir sind haben wir genau aufs richtige pferd gesetzt
5055419 ich liebe das dorfleben wo man wohnt ist doch jedermanns freie entscheidung
5055420 wenn sie die alte pauschale wieder einf hren werden sie es sich an anderer stelle wiederholen da mache ich mir nichts vor
5055421 i think part of the problem in terms of canadians perception of stephane dion has been these attack ads by the conservative government perhaps they have had somewhat of an impact
5055422 the polls seem to indicate a neck and neck race and i think the campaign is going to make a difference i dont think for a second that people have given up on stephane dion
5055423 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
5055424 i dont think voters appreciate bairds abrasive style his caustic approach to politics i think they see him as almost a hyper partisan someone who puts partisanship ahead of good government
5055425 many mothers resign themselves to the fact that they cannot have it all being home with your children when they need you while maintaining a position in the working world
5055426 why not why must we be either a stay at home mom or a working mom why cant we have and be both
5055427 the moon has your name memorised the curl of your back your face an open book
5055428 if i hear the word mommy one more time im going to lose it
5055429 wow you should get a lot of hits with that one
5055430 were disappointed that union leadership forced us to this point
5055431 by failing to negotiate a new contract cwa leadership has denied its membership key union protections and benefits including arbitration its ability to automatically collect dues and bring new hires in as dues fees paying members of the union
5055432 our goal remains gaining a fair contract and we are prepared to continue to bargain in good faith to reach the agreement our members deserve
5055433 russia right now were stretch out across the globe and were kinda too busy to protect our interest plus the olympic games are in motion which make you exempt from bombing but as soon as were done winning we will get back with you on the subject and trust me if it werent for that wed be on your ass like white on rice
5055434 failed to generate a user instance of sql server due to failure in starting the process for the user instance the connection will be closed
5055435 lug the things around with me after youre gone mom
5055436 cant you just put all my photos on a thumb drive and hand it to me
5055437 in choosing templates for workaday graphical productions it is worthwhile to look for excellent conventional templates conventional templates immediately solve a lot of graphical reading problems for the viewer of the display but the classics are often classics because they are off the wall unconventional idiosyncratic one off brilliant historically original performances tinkering with minards napoleons march is no better than an artist tinkering with picassos guernica
5055438 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital
5055439 he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5055440 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya
5055441 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5055442 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5055443 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
5055444 i dont think were out of the woods yet on financials because i dont think were out of the woods on housing
5055445 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf are they inspired by the falling
5055446 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory
5055447 any geopolitical developments whether it be the iranian situation or further developments with russia and georgia those will influence oil markets
5055448 the price increase is necessary to cover the cost of doing business
5055449 the marketplace changes and you have to change your offerings
5055450 there is no indication of any change in the near future regarding the current state of competition
5055451 market forces have not yet met the challenge of controlling price increases
5055452 the obama camp doesnt want to seem as if theyre trying to shove the clintons out of the way that theyre trying to do like the old soviet union and destroy all the statues
5055453 there was no expectation that this guy was going to be a tv guy
5055454 others who are in the space tend to draw more attention to themselves than chuck does
5055455 im really trying to make sure i never go on the air when i have nothing to talk about
5055456 i want to make sure that the people who do pay attention to what i say they feel like they learn something every time
5055457 this campaign coverage has really bounced from controversy to controversy gaffe pingpong
5055458 and that is very much how cable tends to operate
5055459 cable really has replaced broadcast for convention coverage and real political debate and discussion
5055460 televisions first regularly scheduled programming destination dedicated entirely to the environment
5055461 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5055462 i just know that the russian president said several days ago russian military operations would stop
5055463 now he has said that tomorrow midday russian forces will withdraw and withdraw to their pre aug 6 7 lines this time i hope he means it
5055464 georgia if it wants to become a member of nato will become one
5055465 this must happen not in several weeks but in the coming days
5055466 they said they have two options move toward tbilisi or withdraw
5055467 been in charge of kitchens for less than five years
5055468 in pennsylvania we dont have the longest growing season so it makes you creative
5055469 weve found that plastic corks and the vino seal allow in too much air and cause the wines to age too rapidly
5055470 conversely under standard airtight screw caps the wines hardly age at all whereas with cork the wines develop the complexity with time that were looking for were not sure how but it seems some air penetrates the cork or is released from within the cork making the wine more complex we havent found a closure that will do that better than cork
5055471 you can almost always do better than standard gas station fare
5055472 makes some of the most flavorful chips weve ever tasted
5055473 steeps shelled hard boiled eggs in a piquant blend of vinegar and crushed red pepper flakes
5055474 gently fizzy with a soft lemon lime finish and has sparked the interest of soda aficionados nationwide
5055475 puffy porous ones made by carolina country snacks a family owned company in henderson north carolina
5055476 smoked over hickory and maple fueled fire the jerky is tender pleasantly chewy and flavored with worcestershire sauce and tamarind
5055477 pork liver rice onions black pepper and cayenne pepper and crawfish boudin are some of the finest weve had
5055478 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5055479 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5055480 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaida in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5055481 estoy totalmente en contra de cualquier manifestaci n violenta por parte de absolutamente nadie
5055482 para su recuperaci n la v ctima precis una primera asistencia facultativa y tratamiento m dico y quir rgico consistente en 12 puntos de sutura con ocho d as de curaci n e incapacidad para realizar sus funciones habituales adem s de quedarle como secuela una cicatriz de seis cent metros de longitud en la regi n frontal derecha
5055483 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5055484 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5055485 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5055486 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5055487 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5055488 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5055489 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5055490 one of americas oldest and most respected civil rights organizations
5055491 honours celebrates and rewards creativity and diversity in canadian recorded music by recognizing then marketing the albums of the highest artistic integrity without regard to musical genre professional affiliation or sales history as judged by a panel of selected critics and experts
5055492 press a single button at any time and youll see the other side of reality a green and violent dimension thats filled with strange creatures and whirling tornadoes of energy just being in the shroud gives you options floating above the ground are collectors fleshy heavy metal album cover worms that are scavenging electrical energy pop them with a single rifle round and theyll blast apart damaging enemies in the real world they are essentially exploding hidden organic barrels in shroud mode too occult symbols etched into the masonry are transformed into holes in walls that bj can simply step shoot or lob a grenade through
5055493 we prefer not to sign exclusive deals with artists because while it seems like the competitive business thing to do in the long run its really not good for anyone we think we should be working to get more music out to more people
5055494 i knew i should have gotten a zune they cant kill me or do anything else
5055495 youre able to hire an npc character thats your level or below and they come in cleric fighter rogue kind of a variety sorceror as well so they take a place on your hud you can heal them they can heal you you can help them theyll break boxes theyll kill monsters without any instructions from you but they wont zerg through the dungeon they wont open gates you can ask them yeah go ahead and open that gate dude but youre able to control all their behavior so theyre working for you and of course they cost money right so they actually are working for you in the fiction of the game
5055496 we asked around about how the room came together and couldnt get a straight answer some had said our old legal department had run the archive and given it up to someone else to manage others said that the legal archive still exists in another room in the office and this was pulled together over time from producers and product managers we dont know the exact how or why but we love that it exists and immediately accessible
5055497 its not the result i would have wanted but in the context of the season i cannot be too disappointed
5055498 our attacking play was good in the first half but in the second half we struggled at times
5055499 especulaci n de precios que no es algo que se circunscriba al caso boliviano tambi n se da a nivel mundial
5055500 son ajustes son fluctuaciones que se dan en precios internacionales que hay que saber leer con mucha claridad y con frialdad para no dar falsas expectativas
5055501 its too early to be overly confident about the economy
5055502 i still think inflation is the greatest risk to the economy
5055503 inflation is starting to spill over into other goods and services
5055504 a year from today well still be talking about financial problems its not going away
5055505 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5055506 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5055507 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5055508 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5055509 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5055510 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5055511 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5055512 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5055513 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5055514 every now and again the united states has to pick up a crappy little country and throw it against a wall just to prove we are serious
5055515 but tbilisi still has electricity the hospitals are intact the tv stations are broadcasting and its international telecommunications lines are still working shock and awe or ledeenizing would have eliminated those comforts but that did not happen to georgia
5055516 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv
5055517 mobile tv services have taken off in japan and south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5055518 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off
5055519 when they decided they were going to go to bankruptcy i said thats it i dont want to stick around to find out what bankruptcy is like
5055520 whats going to happen to my family if i take a pay cut or i get laid off how long would i be able to make it
5055521 i definitely wanted to stay but as the head of a household i cant just think about my future i have to consider my familys as well
5055522 i was concerned it was no longer going to be feasible to work there that i couldnt stay solvent as a person with a family
5055523 we just dont have the resources the bad guys are smart enough to know it makes it far more fertile ground for them
5055524 trying to create chaos in the community to frighten people
5055525 right now our pay and benefits are too high and we simply cant afford them
5055526 the vallejo police department will be able to offer very good benefits and salary in the future will it be at the lexus level no but it will still be very competitive
5055527 they didnt do anything for me nothing not even a follow up if this would have happened in the past they would have done all that
5055528 people dont call the police anymore unless it has to do with violence or somebodys injured because theres nothing they can do
5055529 they were very confident they could get away with it
5055530 if more officers leave more people are going to get encouraged to do more of these kinds of things
5055531 we are continuously monitoring the storms track and are mobilizing resources based on current projections
5055532 based on the current storm forecast we expect fay to begin affecting the southern areas of our territory beginning tuesday morning and exit our northern areas by midnight wednesday
5055533 we are strategically staging crews throughout our territory based on this forecast
5055534 when i was a lad we used to get our bad cars from wartburg polski fiat british leyland and other leftwing dictatorships
5055535 oh no peace demonstrants they are always the most violent ones
5055536 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5055537 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5055538 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5055539 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5055540 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5055541 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5055542 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5055543 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5055544 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5055545 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5055546 they clearly drew a bright line separating themselves on some issues
5055547 but what was distinct here was they did it without smashing each other
5055548 if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent on that belief then i cant argue with you on that but there are ways that we can work together to reduce unwanted pregnancies
5055549 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade not because i am pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5055550 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5055551 you do everything you can to get that decision right
5055552 all those questions surrounding the war have been very difficult for me
5055553 the warrens give away 90 percent of their income through three charities acts of mercy which serves people with aids equipping leaders which trains leaders in developing countries and the global p e a c e fund which fights poverty disease corruption and illiteracy using local congregations
5055554 americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5055555 i think that americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
5055556 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5055557 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5055558 if you are making 150 000 or less as a family youre middle class i would argue if youre making more than 250 000 then youre in the top 3 or 4 percent in this country youre doing well under the approach im taking if youre making 150 000 or less you will see a tax cut
5055559 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth i dont want to raise anybodys taxes
5055560 no s por qu esto se magnifica tanto ya lo he dicho si el ministro est tan interesado con el tema de la inseguridad en bogot nosotros hacemos todos los martes en la ma ana consejos de seguridad donde participan todas las instancias y adem s los consejos en cada localidad

5055568 henry limpet your name will live forever america owes everything to you
5055569 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5055570 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5055571 all opened around those levels and went on to become 100 million hits
5055572 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5055573 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5055574 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5055575 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5055576 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5055577 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5055578 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists
5055579 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5055580 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength

5055608 africa is fast becoming an important player in cleaner energy sources if only 0 3 of sunlight falling on the sahara and middle eastern deserts can potentially provide all of europes energy needs because of its intensity how about everything else
5055609 how much wind blows from nouakchott to natal and how much of this is ever utilized as an alternative energy source how much water flowing in the zambezi is used to power villages in zambia and zimbabwe and how much more of the great nile waters that flow into the mediterranean can sustainably be harnessed to run corn mills in nakuru and cotton ginneries in jinja and khartoum or fisheries in cairo
5055610 african countries are not using alternative power supplies since international combines do not encourage the switch indeed the use of such technologies may damage their business
5055611 except for companies such as alembic which posted actual losses the losses for companies such as ranbaxy and orchid are only notional the health of leading pharmaceutical companies are good and the fundamentals are strong
5055612 during the last quarter the rupee had fallen by 6 9 per cent and this was the main reason for higher net sales of most of these companies which also posted good profits however when they accounted for the receivables from overseas subsidiaries profits were affected on forex transactions

5055616 when people who think the english language is going to hell in a handcart cite phenomena like this use of like as their evidence things are going a bit too far like functions in younger speakers english as something perfectly ordinary a way to signal hedging about vocabulary choice a momentary uncertainty about whether the adjacent expression is exactly the right form of words or not if the english language didnt implode when if you will took on this kind of role among the baby boomers it will survive having like take on an extremely similar role for their kids the people who grouse about like are myopic old whiners who havent looked at their own like linguistic foibles if you will

5055632 i knew a guy who had converted as an adult to fairly traditional judaism and had been circumcised in his late 20s i gather that is not nearly as easily recovered from as having it done to one as an infant
5055633 if penis cutting is such a powerful symbol of religious dedication men should elect to undergo the tradition not force it on an infant
5055634 jewish american vitality and continuity will be advanced only by education in our european jewish and jewish american heritage not by removal of infant foreskins circumcision is anachronistic sexist and inconsistent with modern jewish american belief and values i support brit shalom ceremonies welcoming newborn boys and girls without damage to genitals
5055635 there are so many elements of tradition which we choose to live without stoning gender oppression etc in light of modern evidence about the value of the whole anatomy and in recognition of basic human rights perhaps our moral sense can let us adopt a tradition which lets a mature male choose the fate of his own body parts

5055644 weve seen just a skyrocketing autism rate some people are suspicious that its connected to the vaccines this person included the science right now is inconclusive but we have to research it

5055646 negative if one is heterosexual and in a low risk group
5055647 this test is not intended to be used as a screening test for hiv or as a diagnostic to confirm hiv infection
5055648 of course the candidates are screwed either way if the look at the data and give an educated response they would be branded as elitist and out of touch with the common folk great now im angry again
5055649 i wish just once a scientist would be elected instead of a lawyer or politician
5055650 no link between vaccination and autism has been proven but the link has not been disproven either
5055651 the question we need to ask is which candidate is most likely to act on real evidence when making a decision

5055653 liver failure in people on haart can be liver failure bc of haart or liver failure bc of some thing other or both togehter hm like hepatitis alcoholism drug use all known proven causing of liver failure
5055654 elevations in these enzymes signal injury to liver cells and in some cases to other cells in the body
5055655 the fact that the findings were similar in two very different cohorts suggests that these results apply to all hiv patients
5055656 furthermore the fact that the most common current cause of death among people with hiv is liver failure suggests that liver injury may be a major limiting factor in the effectiveness of current hiv treatment
5055657 up to one third of hiv patients have mild to moderate elevations in alt and ast yet physicians largely disregard the readings unless they are two to four times above the normal range
5055658 our study shows that even patients whose elevations are mild to moderate have a death rate that is nearly twice that of patients with mid range normal levels this association with increased mortality suggests that any elevation in alt and ast should be addressed
5055659 how nice of both you and amy to confirm peter duesbergs work and admit that hiv positives are not dying of anything having to do with hiv taking out their immune systems
5055660 dying of anything having to do with hiv taking out their immune systems
5055661 stuff like drugs and stress and nutrients and arvs toxicities
5055662 your presented studies never take anything into consideration except the hiv hype pothesis and are without controls or good common sense and are completely meaningless
5055663 duesberg thinks that up to 75 percent of aids cases in the west can be attributed to drug toxicity
5055664 well johnny i know we have been telling you for years that your virus is gonna mutate out of control if you dont take every single dose of your meds on time but now we are gonna try to give you a break from the drug side affects even though we are sure your gonna get sick and may even become drug resistant by doing this but here is 750 bucks to go get loaded on so you can forget your worries
5055665 perhaps you are unaware that these groups are paid an average of 10 000 and up to trial the drugs for the pharma companies
5055666 and which of these other investigators were in on it
5055667 dr wafaa el sadr an aids expert at columbia university received just over 2 million from nihs infectious disease division last year nih said

5055675 yeah you say amy justice looked on sic 5700 aids deaths you say sic a lot of stuff sic and it is all lies all talk why there is so many denialists like that you know and a dissident that cant sic 3 and 4 this post i had to count them sit still on camera hafta sic 5 film him self sic 6 on you tube sic 7 cant they find some body sic 8 like one person to help out may be sic 9 ask p diddy when your dropping him all the lab stuff off sics 10 12 sheesh i was waiting on a you tube sic 10 of those april 23 demos where is it sic 13 you got sic 14 so many friends like that so sic sic sick prove it
5055676 so much the more impressive when they arent able to spin every sentence into
5055677 so are you arguing that the people you think make the study
5055678 you can never really finish remodeling you can only make it stop
5055679 we fully realize that even if the deaths due to ods in this study were 1 8th of 1 percent you would still claim that this proved hiv was the cause and you would still claim this 1 8th of 1 percent was sufficient to keep all on arvs

5055731 showed up in a neighborhood where he wasnt welcome around 11 15 p m near willow pass road and alves lane said sheriffs sgt gwen brady

5055734 que sabe que comete algunas ilegalidades pero que eso no le preocupa porque en su partido existen abogados que las tienen que legalizar pues para eso son profesionales de la ciencia jur dica
5055735 ser un partido duro ellos guaros vienen en busca de un resultado nosotros dejaremos todo en la cancha y saldremos a buscar los tres puntos

5055737 in china we set up an accident research centre in 2005 we go to an accident site to find out exactly what happened there the real cause and then use the findings as design inputs we are considering a similar sort of centre for india every country has a different culture and this can require different safety features
5055738 als we precies weten hoe deze antilichaampjes te werk gaan kunnen we ook een vaccin ontwikkelen tegen allerlei andere virussen
5055739 in saying that as a person of faith obama believes that things will work out and that we will get the president we need he may be picking up on the sovereignty of god whose ways are perfect but one hopes he understands that god in his sovereignty can visit catastrophe on a wayward people if we are spiritually unwise in our choice of leaders we may well get a spanking we need
5055740 mccain answers questions by telling stories obama answers like an academic i think people like storytellers better than professors they will like mccains simple yes and no responses obama tries to show he would be a good leader by recognizing nuance and complexity mccain tries to show he would be a good leader by being decisive
5055741 to grant that abortion is a moral issue but to duck when human life begins is at best inconsistent one would think it is vital no pun intended to think though exactly that question obamas unguarded line about not punishing a daughter of his with a child really hurt him in the pro life movement
5055742 obama has correctly refocused the abortion question on how women experience pregnancy and abortion for far too long the discussion has focused solely on fetuses as if they exist somehow independent of the women in whose bodies they reside
5055743 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5055744 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5055745 obama will be hammered by the religious right for that pay grade answer
5055746 specious obama has made that very determination in opening the law wide to the killing of the unborn
5055747 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5055748 absolute certainty that the woman herself does have moral status then the conservative thing to do is to protect the womans interests first
5055749 still does not answer the question of what to do when there is a conflict with the rights of the woman
5055750 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf and even the so called rhythm method
5055751 which has the effect of timing intercourse not only to prevent conception but also to allow conception at a time when the fertilized egg will drop into a uterus that is not at the right time of month for implantation
5055752 evaded the question of whether he will or will not continue to support embryonic stem cell research as long as the scientists say it is necessary
5055753 odd not to ask it after all if you are going to talk to someone about religion youd be interested to know their thoughts about the central figure in their religion
5055754 is why there were not representatives from other faith communities who are also voting this is a multi religious nation
5055755 personal testimony and scripture citation are both treasured by evangelicals
5055756 mccains knowledge and strong stance for what is just and right he also expressed a sense of humor that i have not seen before

5055794 our members are finding at home that what we re doing here in washington is appreciated
5055795 at least somebody is willing to fight for the no 1 issue for their families today and thats gas prices soon to be followed by energy prices as we get to the fall
5055796 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices

5055837 well you really didnt have to do that man i wasnt that pissed at her
5055838 if that is what is kicked up in you when you have to think about going home just wait so you wont have to go back thru that alone and if you stay your dream might come true
5055839 fine god if you want me to stay for a bit longer make a way
5055840 keep writing and im serious about posting all the chilren
5055841 but that was when we were two separate beings we have evolved the rules have changed
5055842 i thought it was you its me jacob esteves god its been ages
5055843 wrong sanity is a comparison to normality and normality is just majority rules im not crazy i just think out side the box
5055844 ah i can see your curiosity my friend that is a container of a rather sinister concoction calcium carbide and good old h20 see the calcium carbide reacted with the water to create the gas acetylene carbonate and as you well know acetylene is very flammable when the timer goes off it will create an arch strong enough to ignite the gas the result of which being a very large very hot fireball im telling you all this because im giving you a chance to live albeit a small one if you can crawl away before the inferno ill never bother you again and youll be a free ma
5055845 ah shhh shhhh shh shh times a wastin buddy boy hahahahahah
5055846 we havent been called by that mortal name in ages tanya
5055847 well it seems you already know what im to ask of you ten so where
5055848 before you ask anything i have something to question is it true you killed the muse
5055849 its a cruel world theres a point where you get so wrongfully accustomed to being alone that you dont know what to do when your not so you see ive lost everything to have this now tell me where
5055850 thats right i painted the walls red with my resolve and unless you want the same treatment i suggest you start flappin them lips
5055851 w w what have you become how can you do such things
5055852 im a marionette without a puppeteer a savage dog without a chain a bullet thru a crowd i have no purpose no master to serve i just am and thusly i am unfettered by the rules of your society maybe your right maybe the world doesnt deserve what i do to it but i dont see anyone stopping me either
5055853 now your gonna tell me where she is or im gonna show you what happens at the end of the rabbit hole
5055854 sigh is your world really so black and white do you not see the baffling irony in human decay of life how they are given the gift of reason yet the only see two outcomes
5055855 fine tell you what im gonna let you decide the truth
5055856 now if you sit here and finish your food i will have ample time to attend to my business and you will never see me again or
5055857 you can live in your comic book world and be a hero think about it give up a friends life to save your own or prove to the world that there is only two sides to life and go after the villain
5055858 i gave you the chance to live and you flushed it all away
5055859 hmmm how about i give you just one more chance what do ya say
5055860 this should look like a familiar number all thats left is to push send what to do what to do
5055861 so its true then engel you have had your play in recent tragedies
5055862 as sad and misfortunate that might have been this isnt about something so simple see when i was resurrected i had no choice but to go back to my old routine i killed maimed slaughtered spared no child or woman took all lives before me
5055863 but that is your nature you know this you destroy
5055864 yes but something happened there came a day when i stood in regret for everything i had done not because i felt it was wrong or out of remorse but because all that i have done meant nothing all the splitting shrieks eating me away are a burden towards no goal i had no reason i was never told to kill i just did and it was that lack of purpose that changed me havent you felt it the deep misery you cant get rid of even when you have all you desire you still feel the pressure of sorrow feel a missing piece
5055865 so its existence itself you seek to destroy and what do you plan to do dunkler
5055866 im going to remove it its clear to me that you cannot erase the virus by treating the disease the circle will complete and the end will just reach a new beginning so that the past will be replayed in the events of the future as long as there is a beginning the past will never be forgotten even we as gods among the weak cannot escape this so ill cut a hole in the fabric of time and ill take everything back to nothing for if things are as they were before the beginning there wont be a beginning to end at
5055867 what makes you think you will be able to change the world
5055868 i dont want to change it i just wanna stop it
5055869 no this is before the beginning this is zero ive battled the warrior angels as well as the minions of hell to get here what i am to do must be the remedy and against their wishes but try as they might here i stand and eden will burn back to the ground
5055870 ich liebe dich blut rabe und ich bin sehr traurig fur dich
5055871 it was tough to lose a 50 meter race by a hundredth of a second and i realize maybe i should not have filed my nails last night
5055872 but what are you going to do it was my best time ever and as competitive as i am and i want to win i am very happy that i got the silver
5055873 yes women can have children and still compete at a high level she has gotten rid of a lot of the mythology in swimming that has been there for so so long
5055874 if it helps anyone else out there who is in their middle aged years who maybe put off something they thought they could not do because they were too old or maybe thought because they have children that they can not balance what they want to do and being a parent
5055875 if that can help anyone out there to show what i have done and that you can do it then i am absolutely thrilled
5055876 going in i would have been happy with 250 million
5055877 titanic is king of the box office and will remain that way forever

5055907 not only to prove biblical christianity but to make sense of any fact in the world van til holds that one must presuppose the reality of the self contained triune god and the self attesting revelation of the scriptures
5055908 the presuppositionalist endeavors to convince the unregenerate first by demonstrating that on unregenerate presuppositions of chance occurrence in an impersonal universe one cannot account for any sort of order and rationality
5055909 van til vigorously criticized the traditional apologetic approach of both catholics and protestants as failing to challenge the non christian view of knowledge as allowing sinners to be judges of ultimate reality and of arguing merely for the probability of christianity
5055910 a growing number of liberal christians and scholars do not believe that jesus rose bodily from the dead but what could be the ultimate cause of such a slide into unbelief in an area that is so vital and central to the gospel as the resurrection of christ
5055911 you tell me what the standards of truth and certainty are and ill meet those standards and then youll see christianity is true
5055912 even though youve proven the resurrection to me i dont need christianity because my standards are sufficient as far as they go
5055913 there can be no certainty regarding anything without first assuming the truthfulness of christianity

5055929 la concertaci n plural como fue pensada en sus or genes ya no existe el desplazamiento del cobismo del gobierno a partir del voto de cobos en el senado desconfigur el acuerdo inicial que fue lo que la gente vot en octubre
5055930 sigue siendo el pol tico con mayor imagen positiva de alrededor del 70 por ciento y est descubriendo un nuevo espacio que todav a tiene l mites difusos ni el piso ni el techo son claros y tampoco est claro si el fen meno es permanente o provisorio
5055931 est en condiciones de aprovechar el lugar de la oposici n moderada para llegar al electorado enojado del kirchnerismo que no acepta la confrontaci n o situaciones como las de guillermo moreno y del indec y que ve en l lo que vot en octubre de todas maneras no puede ni le conviene quedar muy expuesto mientras siga siendo vicepresidente
5055932 el kirchnerismo va a tener que pensar como reconstruir el apoyo electoral que le permiti ganar a cristina el voto de la clase media rural claramente afectada por el conflicto con el campo dif cilmente retorne al kirchnerismo
5055933 el gobierno sabe que no puede descansar s lo en el peronismo tradicional por algo se ali con cobos y parte del radicalismo en su momento van a tener que idear un estrategia para reconquistar al electorado perdido en estas condiciones es imposible pensar en un 45 por ciento como el que el oficialismo logr en octubre
5055934 la concertaci n plural como fue lanzada el 25 de mayo de 2007 perdi sentido no sobrevivi a la crisis con el campo el enfrentamiento entre la presidenta y el vice le quita el n cleo fundamental que fue la f rmula conjunta
5055935 la decisi n de cobos de seguir manteniendo una l nea pol tica independiente est clara y la decisi n de cristina kirchner de no buscar una reconciliaci n tambi n
5055936 la concertaci n fue una construcci n de n stor kirchner y de alberto fern ndez que nunca funcion muy bien que el ex presidente se abroquelara en el pj m s puro y los hombres m s alejados de la concertaci n como los caudillos bonaerenses y los sindicalistas es una clara se al de que la crisis en la coalici n es irreversible
5055937 hay un paralelo evidente el presidente y el vicepresidente pertenecen a fuerzas distintas y hay un acuerdo roto pero se trata de dos pa ses muy distintos y las causas de la ruptura tambi n lo son las similitudes son de forma pero no de fondo

5056288 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5056289 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5056290 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5056291 it is also called the olympic games not the olympic sports performed by athletes

5056298 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5056299 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5056300 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5056301 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5056302 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5056303 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5056304 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5056307 me gusta correr este marat n y me gust la ruta pero tuve muchos problemas por tanta vuelta

5056312 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5056313 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5056314 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5056315 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5056316 i think part of the problem in terms of canadians perception of stephane dion has been these attack ads by the conservative government perhaps they have had somewhat of an impact
5056317 the polls seem to indicate a neck and neck race and i think the campaign is going to make a difference i dont think for a second that people have given up on stephane dion
5056318 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
5056319 i dont think voters appreciate bairds abrasive style his caustic approach to politics i think they see him as almost a hyper partisan someone who puts partisanship ahead of good government

5056330 those on whom he has passed the decree of death he keeps back from returning to life but the rest he sends to their bodies for a term appointed verily in this are signs for those who reflect
5056331 sleep being twin brother to death our souls are for the time being released from the bondage of the flesh allah takes them for the time being if as some do we are to die peacefully in sleep our soul does not come back to the physical body and the latter decays and dies if we still have some period of life to fulfill according to allahs decree our soul comes back to the body and we resume our function in this life
5056332 ik weet hoe het is om individueel olympisch kampioene te worden maar niet hoe dat is met de estafetteploeg ik ben trots op jullie
5056333 voor jullie maak ik een uitzondering ik kom nooit op het podium
5056334 en deze finale is sowieso de bevestiging van het feit dat het enkelspel in de laatste weken goed verloopt
5056335 de resultaten bleven de laatste maanden uit kwestie van steeds n t niet

5056338 not only to prove biblical christianity but to make sense of any fact in the world van til holds that one must presuppose the reality of the self contained triune god and the self attesting revelation of the scriptures
5056339 the presuppositionalist endeavors to convince the unregenerate first by demonstrating that on unregenerate presuppositions of chance occurrence in an impersonal universe one cannot account for any sort of order and rationality
5056340 van til vigorously criticized the traditional apologetic approach of both catholics and protestants as failing to challenge the non christian view of knowledge as allowing sinners to be judges of ultimate reality and of arguing merely for the probability of christianity
5056341 a growing number of liberal christians and scholars do not believe that jesus rose bodily from the dead
5056342 you tell me what the standards of truth and certainty are and ill meet those standards and then youll see christianity is true
5056343 even though youve proven the resurrection to me i dont need christianity because my standards are sufficient as far as they go
5056344 there can be no certainty regarding anything without first assuming the truthfulness of christianity
5056345 we can take anything in the world that anybody claims to know i
5056346 unbelievers can count but they cant account for their accounting
5056347 where is the wise man where is the scribe where is the debater of this age has not god made foolish the wisdom of the world
5056348 you cant know anything for sure unless christianity is true
5056349 we win the gold medal im speechless i cant very well say its the happiest day of my life because ive got married between athens and now this is a close second
5056350 hopefully there are more to come with canoeing starting and trampoline obviously were hoping there is a good momentum for more medals
5056351 i was proud of what i was able to achieve today
5056352 im ending my career doing my personal best at the olympic games and you couldnt ask for much more than that
5056353 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
5056354 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
5056355 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point
5056356 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
5056357 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and iain said go for it we committed everything we had and went
5056358 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
5056359 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
5056360 it was a hard race i think the first half took a lot out of me for the second half i just couldnt be happier
5056361 i was emotional scared and nervous it was absolutely unbelievable
5056362 i thought it would feel like competing in a commonwealth games or world championship but it was a completely different level
5056363 i hope this medal is a stepping stone for british gymnastics i hope it will inspire youngsters to come into our sport

5056365 i guess china is obsessed with winning olympics gold medals and we should take inspiration from it in india there is no dearth of talent but a lot needs to be done to utilise it in a proper manner
5056366 the national olympic committee of south africa must declare formally that it understands and submits to the spirit of the olympic charter it must also obtain from its government before december 31 1963 modification of its policy of racial discrimination in sport and competitions on its territory failing which the south african national olympic committee will be forced to withdraw from the olympic games
5056367 we have no relations with west indies india and pakistan we had no such ties in the past nor did i regard it as necessary that we should have them in future
5056368 to suspend cultural educational sporting and other exchanges with the racist regime and with organisations or institutions in south africa which practise apartheid
5056369 australians should never let an afternoons entertainment blind them to a lifetimes repression for another nation
5056370 every practical step to discourage contact or competition of their nationals with sporting organisations teams or sportsmen from south africa
5056371 there can be no normal sport in an abnormal society
5056372 there is no doubt we are behind schedule right now
5056373 there is no clear planning and things are moving at snails pace
5056374 the sheer magnitude of planning involved in the olympics is mind boggling and we would draw inspiration from the best practices followed here
5056375 the old records seemed as fragile as glass bottles in the water cube
5056376 i wasnt that keen on swimming but now i switch to the sports channel every morning at 10 a m to see phelps swim
5056377 it is difficult since we dont even have a track in afghanistan
5056378 if we have a track like this i can also win an olympic medal its my dream to compete with asafa powell and tyson gay
5056379 my parents were born in the mainland and went to taiwan in 1949 it was their lifetime dream to come back to their ancestral home
5056380 we often play basketball together and yao has always been our idol
5056381 i returned to the 10 000 because i cant run the marathon here but i didnt want to miss beijing
5056382 ive got plenty of time for world records in the future
5056383 im ready to kiss it goodbye if he keeps on doing what hes doing
5056384 i felt myself pulling away from the rest and i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line
5056385 it was only a matter of time before he began producing times like hes producing now
5056386 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5056387 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5056388 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
5056389 at the world half marathon championships in canada everybody said i couldnt run but i showed today what i can do
5056390 if you want to commit suicide it is up to you but you do not have the right to kill your country
5056391 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport

5056399 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5056400 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5056401 he told us im just one of you guys tonight
5056402 i really do have to suspect adobes motivation for keeping flash on linux in such a deplorable state
5056403 never ascribe to malice what can be explained by incompetence
5056404 a day game and a right handed pitcher jeff karstens
5056405 im trying to get murphy acclimated to the big leagues
5056406 he hadnt said anything but that is an indication of why he was dropping his arm a little bit
5056407 the first time i heard about the discomfort was after the game on friday night we had been talking about what kind of adjustments we need to make him better and once we heard that he had the discomfort that changed our thoughts on what to do with him
5056408 well let him relax for a few days clear his head kick back a little bit and then go back to work
5056409 by the end of this period on the disabled list hopefully he will feel better about himself and get back to pitching the way hes capable of pitching
5056410 i have seen a lot of sink in his between start workouts but we were right there to remind him to stay on top stay on top
5056411 in the course of a game and in the heat of battle he tries to throw hard and that straightens out the ball and he has been dropping his arm
5056412 so instead of the ball sinking it has been going sideways i asked him about it and he said he was aware of it i thought maybe he was doing it by design
5056413 jag k nner f rakt f r dessa d rar
5056414 i wasnt babying it i was actually seeing the ball and trying to put a good swing on it i know the last four or five games i played i definitely wasnt myself i was rolling over everything trying to not to hurt myself
5056415 i couldnt push off my back side and that forced me to jump at the ball and i was swinging at stuff over my head i was just seeing it and going after it instead of recognizing it out of the pitchers hand and staying back on it thats what i feel like i can do now
5056416 its a little sore today after playing all 13 innings but its feeling all right
5056417 i was like hey rusty get that demon out of me
5056418 mo e na sali wida kto kogo trafi w telewizji za choler pozna mo na tylko po wiate ku
5056419 ill tell you what when youre a young player and you know the manager is smart hes probably pretty smart
5056420 when youre 21 or 22 everyone thinks they know everything and they know more than the manager we all knew he was ahead of the game hed tell you two innings ahead of time who was pinch hitting and why it was a treat
5056421 hes got the temperament for managing in the major leagues right now
5056422 i had lunch with my son the last two days
5056423 i said these days i wouldnt last a week managing he said dad you wouldnt last a day thats how much different it is than it was 20 years ago
5056424 if a guys making 140 million you have to keep him on the field
5056425 its different life is different i think dick admitted openly that he doesnt want to do it i dont think you sacrifice your principles but its different
5056426 i didnt know i had to talk to a player every time he walked by me
5056427 if i had something to say itd probably be constructive i never had to say anything constructive to terry francona he knew how to play

5056429 i was going good before i got sick so it was a little frustrating to have that happen
5056430 but im looking forward to finishing as strong as i can
5056431 hes got some history on his side but its also just the way he goes about his business
5056432 hes not a guy that just walks out there grabs a bat and expects to hit hes a student of hitting pays attention feels accountable for his spot in the lineup youre always going to pull for those kinds of guys weve got a number of them

5056463 la prueba ha sido muy divertida desde el principio hemos estado muy juntos y la verdad es que sab a donde pod a superar a mis rivales esta vez ha salido todo bien y ahora nos vamos con muchas ganas a san marino
5056464 penso che la vittoria a laguna non ha scardinato certezze in stoner ma stata molto importante per me ha detto stata importante per il mio morale e quello della squadra per tre gare stoner ci ha fatto davvero paura stato difficile per noi reagire ma a laguna abbiamo dimostrato che possiamo batterlo oggi stato pi facile che a laguna perch eravamo pi vicini alla ducati come passo e 50 punti di vantaggio in campionato sono importanti

5056544 the ideology of the left believes big government and social reform will solve social ills while the right believes big business and economic growth will do it the left expects a citizen to be held legally accountable for the use of his wealth but totally autonomous in other areas such as sexual morality the right expects a citizen to be held legally accountable in areas of personal morality but totally autonomous in the use of wealth the north american idol radical individualism lies beneath both ideologies a christian sees either solution as fundamentally humanistic and simplistic

5056561 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do

5056626 we had sought opinions of various consultants who had advised us that small and medium players could form consortia to bid for such highway projects but now it seems the current guidelines could lead to cartelization among a few big players
5056627 my personal view however is that there should be some kind of restriction on the number of players for instance from five it can be raised to 10 or 15 again i feel if the two stage qualification norms are removed then minimum standards criterion be raised

5056670 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5056671 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5056672 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5056673 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5056674 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5056675 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5056676 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5056677 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5056678 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5056679 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5056680 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5056681 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5056682 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5056683 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5056684 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5056685 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5056686 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5056687 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5056688 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5056689 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5056690 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5056691 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5056692 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5056693 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5056694 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5056695 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5056696 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5056697 when we display our bodies without shame because what we expose is prostitution in other feelings towards us those who are not eligible unless they wish to be publicly owned that is we are being prostitutes even mentally
5056698 if you want to avoid a sexual assault do not use provocative clothing care for your eyes and your gestures do not stay alone with a man albeit one known to you brook no talks or spicy jokes
5056699 we have set up a trust shriram employees welfare trust that owns shriram capital ltd the holding company for financial services that owns 24 stake in shriram transport finance co ltd
5056700 this is one way of making executives own their group
5056701 we have a committee of outsiders that select employees once in few years to become a member of the trust these employees who own shares in the trust can either take their wealth at the time of their retirement with full benefits or will have to take a cut if they resign before they retire
5056702 we dont think in terms of one person as a successor it is like a partnership people will have to work to earn their share a single person cannot own everything
5056703 even more free to read articles not located on this blog from me to you for which i receive millions of zillions of dollars for you reading

5056706 for a dream to happen you gotta let it go
5056707 it will take four six months for the identification and acquisition of land then we will involve private sector participation
5056708 admission criteria would be fixed by the school managements the draft document for the model schools will reach the cabinet in a months time
5056709 at the moment the business case for an academic medical centre is not very bright though there is hope that a more realistic and practical approach shall be adopted by the powers that have the authority
5056710 there is a huge shortage of medical personnel in the country and there is a clear need for private sector participation
5056711 the medical council of india mci guidelines have some barriers that have stopped private sector participation in this sector
5056712 the private companies will have to form not for profit societies to enter the sector
5056713 the other question is of the state governments expectations and the fee structure if the private companies play by the mci guidelines to the book it will be very difficult to make money
5056714 this is being done to discourage non serious private players from entering into this kind of an arrangement
5056715 i am not sure how this will work for an example who decides that how the teachers are selected and rewarded creation of capital assets alone will not help but it is the provision of teaching services which is more important

5056717 let my prayer arise in your sight as incense the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice
5056718 whenever two or three are gathered together in my name i am in their midst
5056719 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
5056720 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5056721 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5056722 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5056723 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5056724 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5056725 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5056726 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5056727 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5056728 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5056729 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5056730 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5056731 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5056732 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5056733 the way i look at it if you get something from a doctor you dont like you find a doctor that gives you better options i found another doctor who said id live seven to 20 years so i like that doctor better
5056734 ive missed two of the three games with richmond senior since andrew has been on the varsity
5056735 he tries to be involved as much as he can without being intrusive
5056736 i aspire to be as strong as him and tough in all areas of life
5056737 i knew it drove him crazy to be as uninvolved as he was just going to the games i was happy for him that hes found a way to get a little more satisfaction feeling a part of the team
5056738 he could play linebacker for us but hes sacrificed for the team to play offensive line
5056739 hes a little undersized to be a lineman 6 1 220 but hes tough as nails
5056740 i dont know what level of football he can play but he would be a valuable member of any team because hes that kind of kid
5056741 its important for our family as much as it is for the team
5056742 its a last chance to get a ring im just ready to get going
5056743 im just a dad whos kind of sick whos looking forward to watching his son play

5056745 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5056746 we believe the light aircraft was also hoping to land at coventry
5056747 it was a very very routine piece of work and the plane was about to land in a normal routine fashion
5056748 we are liaising with the met office in relation to possible heavy rainfall in coming days and we are taking all reasonable precautions to protect continuity of our service
5056749 in some parts the water had reached waist level and we wanted to ensure that nobody was stranded in their homes

5056756 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5056757 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5056758 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5056759 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5056760 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5056761 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5056762 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5056763 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5056764 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5056765 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5056766 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5056767 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5056768 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5056769 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5056770 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5056771 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5056772 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5056773 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5056774 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5056775 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5056776 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5056777 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5056778 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5056779 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

5056782 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5056783 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5056795 weve been extremely close on a number occasions in recent times that ive been involved in the team
5056796 the springboks get tremendous support at home and its been frustrating to come here so many times and not to come away with a win
5056797 thats the challenge that awaits us on this tour to close out a game on a winning note
5056798 i think there were a few times especially in the first half that the springboks were extremely unlucky not to score
5056799 if they had grabbed their scoring chances then probably the whole game would have changed
5056800 i think that the all blacks were really committed to their game plan
5056801 theres a lot of positives that the springboks will take out of their match against the all blacks theyll be on the rebound and the loss will spur them on for a spirited performance in durban
5056802 weve done our analysis on the newlands test and as the week goes well get more details
5056803 we must be ready for a massive test in durban and not worry about the second test in joburg it would be premature to do that
5056804 over the years our super rugby sides have done well in cape town and given their record we decided it would be good for us to prepare here after a long flight its very convenient here and players feel very comfortable
5056805 in cape town its like business as usual for us its a good place to acclimatise and were hoping to transfer our success at provincial super rugby franchise to test level
5056806 this team have aspired to do well in africa and this is a good place to start our preparations
5056807 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
5056808 our excessive dependence on opec has already taken a tremendous toll on our economy and our people this is the direct cause of the long lines which have made millions of you spend aggravating hours waiting for gasoline its a cause of the increased inflation and unemployment that we now face this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very security of our nation

5056866 the ankle swelled up right away and we couldnt give him any time to recover
5056867 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5056868 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5056869 in the context of the season we can come from behind theres no question about that
5056870 there are 37 games left and its not a disaster we lacked real width and penetration to make a make a difference to that game and that was a real problem
5056871 they call me blockhead in the changing room so sometimes it comes in handy
5056872 its a huge result for us and by going to the champions we knew it was going to be tough well take a lot of positives
5056873 whatever side manchester united put out theyre a great side
5056874 you cant carry anybody here but if you put in a good performance and have a good attitude you just might get a result

5056879 i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5056880 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5056881 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5056882 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5056883 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5056884 obviously ive been the no 1 european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5056885 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week

5056892 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5056893 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5056894 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5056895 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5056896 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5056897 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5056899 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website

5056901 statements from both the bush administration and republican presidential candidate sen john mccain regarding the continuing conflict between russia and georgia indicate once again their shared predisposition to involve americas armed forces in foreign conflicts with no clear link to our countrys vital national security interests
5056902 president george w bush is now sending u s soldiers to georgia under the banner of providing humanitarian assistance placing american forces in an unsettled war zone that clearly risks involving the u s in a confrontation with russia
5056903 the rationale for sen mccains refusal to rule out u s military action in behalf of georgian president saakashvili remains unclear
5056904 whether sen mccains position favoring u s involvement is based on his personal friendship with the georgian leader on a view that u s national interests are somehow immediately and seriously threatened by the conflict between russia and georgia or on some other assessment is unclear but
5056905 it threatens to involve us in a dispute challenging a heavily armed nuclear power in its backyard
5056906 the dispute between russia and georgia has roots going back many centuries and in the current conflict neither side has clean hands
5056907 a similar apparent failure to understand the deep long standing and historic animosities between ethnic and religious groups in iraq led to serious miscalculations in that country we ought to be much more careful about threatening u s military involvement in such situations than current leaders in washington including president bush and sen mccain appear to comprehend
5056908 u s foreign policy should be based on a hard headed assessment of u s interests not warm and fuzzy feelings about a particular foreign leader
5056909 moreover the most important american interest is defending america sen mccain appears to have forgotten that essential principle since intervening on behalf of georgia has nothing to do with defending america

5056916 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5056917 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5056918 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5056919 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
5056920 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

5056923 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5056924 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5056925 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5056926 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5056927 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5056928 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5056929 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5056930 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5056931 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5056932 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
5056933 repentance must always begin in the house of god doubtless the best place for it to start is with those who preach let us examine some errors of preaching that stand in the way of revival all of us by our very own natures are lovers of self more than lovers of righteousness true gospel preaching exposes the wickedness of this self orientation and calls its hearers to radical conversion it is only through a genuine christian conversion that a complete change of heart and life occurs enabling one to keep the great commandments of christ loving god with all ones heart soul mind and strength and ones neighbor as oneself mark 12 29 31 man centered preaching cannot result in radical conversion tragically the preaching which characterizes much of todays pulpit activity wallows in the weakness of pandering to perceived needs needs which are ordinarily dramatically different from true needs for instance many of those who are clamoring for acceptance really need repentance and multitudes who come to church for comfort need to be severly discomforted and awakened out of their lethal slumbering in a day when multitudes have overloaded on self love man centered preaching only fortifies man in his lostness it may be add a modicum of religion to his life even a proof text assurance of faith to which he vainly clings but it does not bring those who hear into a saving relationship with jesus christ every preacher is in danger of telling his people what they want to hear the motives for doing so are numerous including larger paychecks greater applause easier circumstances if the preacher is called by men he may sensibly give those who called him what they want but what if the preacher is called by god how can he dare speak less than all the truth of god every genuine revival constitutes a return of the people of god thus any preaching that is not god centered that does not life up and exalt the god of the bible above all else calling all to return to him will prove to be a distinct hindrance to revival may god deliver each of us from this hindrance

5057089 ill never be able to get that out of my head i guess you learn to move on and its something you have to live with
5057090 i remember him getting into the car and saying god wants me to go to michigan
5057091 after that i started sleeping a lot better because i knew what kind of men were going to be taking care of my son
5057092 he doesnt let his pain affect him at all were trying to help him along any way we can but he wants to be just like any other guy
5057093 his fathers dream was to watch him play college football and so the first time he comes out of the michigan stadium tunnel and the first hit he takes its going to have a different meaning than it would have
5057094 i dont think its so much that hes putting up a brave front i think hes a brave person i think hes a courageous person and i think hes a faith filled person
5057095 i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5057096 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5057097 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5057098 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5057099 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5057100 obviously ive been the no 1 european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5057101 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week
5057102 its such a high in my career it very easily could be the last high and many players have failed at this point in the past
5057103 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
5057104 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
5057105 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness

5057114 kalau sesorang mencintaimu dia takkan merusak kamu kalau sesorang mengedepankan nafsunya dari gegabah mencium mengambil perawanmu itu bajingan aku bukan bajingan aku menyayangimu siapa pun takkan kubiarkan merusakmu lahriah dan bathiniah

5057118 i think part of the problem in terms of canadians perception of stephane dion has been these attack ads by the conservative government perhaps they have had somewhat of an impact
5057119 the polls seem to indicate a neck and neck race and i think the campaign is going to make a difference i dont think for a second that people have given up on stephane dion
5057120 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
5057121 i dont think voters appreciate bairds abrasive style his caustic approach to politics i think they see him as almost a hyper partisan someone who puts partisanship ahead of good government

5057140 ive always put my country first and one of the times i had that test was years ago and far way in a north vietnamese prison camp when our north vietnamese captors came to me and said you can go home early well my friends
5057141 we were appalled two weeks ago when john mccain was the only senator who chose to skip a crucial vote on the future of clean energy in america dooming the measure to fail by just a single vote
5057142 mccain missed votes to save his constituents 499 million dollars at the pump and at least 550 million on their energy bills while creating more than 10 000 new clean energy jobs in his home state
5057143 out of 535 members of congress john mccain is the only one who chose to miss every single key environmental vote scored by the league of conservation voters last year when it came time to stand up and vote for the environment john mccain was nowhere to be found
5057144 every other member who received a zero from lcv last year at least had the temerity to show up and vote against the environment and clean energy time after time and unlike john mccain i doubt any of them would claim to be environmental leaders or champions on global warming
5057145 the votes chosen by lcv represent the most important votes on the most pressing environmental matters facing us today energy global warming clean water stewardship of our public lands and other crucial issues
5057146 john mccains lcv score exposes the real record behind the rhetoric a lifetime pattern of voting with polluters and special interests instead of consumers and the planet when it comes time to stand up and be counted or perhaps worse yet a consistent refusal to stand up and be counted at all we encourage people to contact john mccain and tell him its time to start showing up to vote when the environment is on the line
5057147 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead
5057148 a place for america to hear the candidates hearts by going beyond moral issues and their virtues to also share their values and vision for leadership
5057149 though appearing separately the candidates will field similar questions about their faith abortion same sex marriage and humanitarian efforts abroad

5057511 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
5057512 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
5057513 i am amazed at how my views have changed since i started reading lrc
5057514 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5057515 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5057516 the advertising campaign concept was based on the fact that the actor has roots
5057517 if there is anything i am lacking in it is taste in music and art and other great things in life
5057518 several key problems that lie beneath the emirates glittering facade
5057519 dubai is still an autocracy where real evidence of an opening for true democracy proves hard to find and where far less political reform has occurred than in neighboring gulf states including even saudi arabia
5057520 an extreme nanny state in which every aspect of their financial lives has been taken care of
5057521 a weekday visit to any of dubais major shopping malls reveals legions of able bodied young men drinking coffee and playing video games
5057522 nee het is echt uit de tijd en ze komen alleen even van hun zwembad om wat geld op te halen meer is het echt niet

5057525 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
5057526 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
5057527 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
5057528 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
5057529 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5057530 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5057531 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway

5057535 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
5057536 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
5057537 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
5057538 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
5057539 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
5057540 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5057541 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
5057542 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
5057543 besides the terrible killings inflicted by the fanatics on those who refuse to pledge allegiance to them has lost credibility for enforcing a series of rules imposing their way of thought on the most mundane aspects of everyday life
5057544 most people have a notion that elderly people have very weak immunity or they have lost immunity
5057545 this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5057546 its important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus that has implications for new pandemic viruses
5057547 the elderly might be a very good donor source for finding antibodies against viruses
5057548 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5057549 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along
5057550 the implication of this study is the 1918 virus was so powerful that the immunity you had to have in order to survive was so prominent that it lasted for the rest of your life
5057551 so those in certain age groups who had seen a related virus had the strongest responses
5057552 either they died or they developed a profound immune response
5057553 president medvedev agreed but we cannot postpone and we cannot delay with these tasks
5057554 assured that georgians will not continue to use military force
5057555 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5057556 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5057557 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5057558 i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not
5057559 however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5057560 will convene again just to deal with the situation of zimbabwe
5057561 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5057562 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5057563 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5057564 i hate my hands i hate you i hate the piano
5057565 he sat in the corner very quietly and at no point interfered there were a few nice occasions when id make suggestions and you could see the father smiling
5057566 the problem wasnt his attitude but the tone he set for other parents it became more competitive
5057567 weve made it clear weve posted signs that parents are welcome in our building but not upstairs in the studios or in rehearsals unless specifically invited by a faculty member they want to protect their own children but they also spy on others to compare talents
5057568 its something we have to deal with and hope that students understand that its very difficult to change the parents
5057569 we can only intervene when there is some action taken within the building
5057570 none of the appeals from brazil india south africa and venezuela received the support for further processing of two thirds of the members of the iso technical management board and iec standardization management board as required by iso iec rules governing the work of their joint technical committee iso iec jtc 1
5057571 its the first thing that everyone mentions the thing that everyone wants to know about him isnt that peculiar they say but i dont know that it is that peculiar
5057572 a lot of it makes an awful lot of sense and a lot of movie directors that ive worked with work in a similar way
5057573 for instance i never sat down and had a big conversation about my character with christopher nolan
5057574 im not trivializing it woody is certainly an eccentric individual but i think theres an awful lot of nonsense thats cooked up around the cult of woody allen
5057575 we got there and we didnt really know what we were going to do with it
5057576 the good thing is that woody shoots all of the exploratory stuff
5057577 because theres nothing worse than doing that thing where you rehearse something and something good happens and then you all sit around and go and that was great wasnt it that thing that happened
5057578 it never works so i appreciate the fact that he shoots all that working out stuff
5057579 and we did it for a long time that scene and we worked it in lots of different ways and we shot it in lots of different ways and i think whats finally there is a mishmash of things that we tried out but it was written so brilliantly that scene that it would have worked anyway
5057580 ive lived in england my whole life but my mothers from detroit
5057581 i essentially can be american as much as i can be english
5057582 its not a light decision at all to go into something that all of your family does for obvious reasons
5057583 and there was definitely a stage where i didnt tell anyone that i wanted to act even though i might have wanted to somewhere deep down my rebellion didnt really amount to much apart from wandering around at family parties and telling everyone i was going to be a painter
5057584 thats the thing if i was going to rebel properly i would have had to have been a banker or a rocket scientist but that side of my brain was not functioning at all
5057585 without wanting to come over all sort of feminist about it its just brilliant to watch a female director because there arent many of them around unfortunately she has a knack of just commanding everyones respect whilst being very witty and brilliant
5057586 its about two neighboring apartments in a building in downtown new york
5057587 catherine keener and her husband oliver platt and their 15 year old daughter live in one and the other one is home to a woman in her 90s who has two grandchildren who are me and amanda peet were sort of caring for her
5057588 when youre a 14 year old and youre fantasizing about where your lifes going to go i sat around fantasizing about playing a particular type of woody allen american heroine in a particular type of romantic bittersweet funny woody allen film
5057589 and suddenly i was sitting there with it in my lap is this really happening its very peculiar
5057590 but then youre set with a whole other set of problems
5057591 you know be careful what you wish for youve got to live up to your own expectations of yourself which is always a nightmare
5057592 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging
5057593 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5057594 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5057595 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5057596 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5057597 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5057598 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5057599 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5057600 i find it no different than selling a picture that say my brother drew
5057601 hopefully romance im an extremely sensitive man falsely accused and serving a life sentence behind these prison walls
5057602 its a good way to attract families so that they can learn about you know small steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint
5057603 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors
5057604 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5057605 a lot of them used to just leave them running all night because it looks nice
5057606 the rides that come in when youre talking about the types and sizes of exhibit buildings that we have it is a massive undertaking
5057607 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool
5057608 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5057609 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins
5057610 the most important element is if theyre really taking it seriously or if theyre just paying lip service
5057611 jag k nner f rakt f r dessa d rar
5057612 i had no idea about many of the people in the film
5057613 you have everybody in this from chris rock to serena williams you have the complete spectrum from colin powell to
5057614 i sent him a note saying i always thought you were born in uniform defending republicans until i saw this
5057615 we threw around thoughts about working together on something and we werent sure if it was a book or maybe it was a film and maybe it was a show of my portraits
5057616 and here we are 21 2 years later and its all of those things its a book thats coming out next month from simon amp schuster and it is a traveling show of portraits thats in houstons museum of fine arts now going to the brooklyn museum
5057617 i dont know a single black person who likes hearing that stuff like the blacklist or black hearted
5057618 so why dont we just get together a really cool interesting group of black people and call it the black list so much about the black culture has been about reclaiming the negative anyway
5057619 thats the only way i thought i was ever going to be involved in the movies
5057620 its funny ive worked at comcast and ive done some things before but collectively this is all sort of our first experience
5057621 so everything that we said we were going to do people would say oh no that wont happen
5057622 wed say well were going to take it to sundance
5057623 you cant get into sundance you guys have never done anything
5057624 and then we got the call guess what were in sundance
5057625 then we say you know weve been talking to hbo
5057626 hbo come on do you know how hard it is to get hbo to even look at your documentary
5057627 at the end of the film it says to blacks to whites to latinos asians everybody that watches that all right this is what inspired me this is what i saw this is what i observed along the way but none of us had any excuses
5057628 we ended up where we are because we would not settle for anything other than that

5057630 the pennhurst story was and continues to be about failing to recognize the worth of people and places that whether we like or it not defines us
5057631 and all of a sudden one day we told them you cant do that anymore
5057632 people really believed that people with mental retardation had no feelings so they werent bothered by being naked in a room with 100 other naked people
5057633 its really odd what we are able to justify once we divorce ourselves from people
5057634 when we dehumanize and write off a segment of our society and render them non people we can get away with a lot of horrible things
5057635 it is a problem if we dont recall the mistakes we made as a society
5057636 in my judgment the state was derelict in letting this go on for decades
5057637 it might be far easier for a developer to retrofit and not tear them down
5057638 a restored pennhurst campus holds tremendous promise economically and environmentally that far outweighs those to be gained by tearing everything down and throwing up houses or a big box store
5057639 its part of our job to make sure people know what they have and what they stand to lose
5057640 small intimate ceremony with only a few close friends and family
5057641 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
5057642 jen was sitting at a table inside and then suddenly courteney cox walked in
5057643 they were pretty surprised and excited to run into each other jen looked incredible
5057644 i was like this is madonnas underwear of course it didnt fit me
5057645 every time bill macy walks into the room my heart still jumps that is true to this day
5057646 hey dj doofus what are you going out as this year for halloween

5057657 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5057658 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5057659 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5057660 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5057661 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5057662 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5057663 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5057664 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5057665 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5057666 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5057667 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5057668 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5057669 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
5057670 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
5057671 what do you want your look to say to people
5057672 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5057673 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5057674 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5057675 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5057676 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5057677 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
5057678 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5057679 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5057680 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5057681 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5057682 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5057683 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5057684 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5057685 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5057686 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5057687 on the 22nd i had my biopsy and on the 23rd the next morning they confirmed it
5057688 they took all the muscle away the rest is actually being held in by scar tissue i dont have a shoulder joint so i wont get rotation back they took the rotator cuff away as well
5057689 he said its spread to your lungs theres nothing we can do youre going to die
5057690 overall survival for cancer in children around the western world was around 20 thats risen steadily now 80 of children diagnosed with cancer in 2008 will be cured of their disease
5057691 in comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment centres have better outcomes than those who are treated not on a clinical trial and not in a treatment centre
5057692 so in fact what we can say in new zealand is that a child diagnosed today with say acute lymphoid leukaemia is going to get the same treatment they would get if they were in new york san francisco the mayo clinic toronto sydney or christchurch its the same treatment paradigm so that gives us a gold standard of therapy
5057693 help our guys get more access to clinical trials its wrong and its really unfair that they dont and so were trying to say whats the barrier here
5057694 id have two weeks of the first two and then a week of the other the most i would get off between treatments would be two weeks

5057699 pharmaceutical companies invest an average of more than 500 million over more than a decade to bring new medicines to patients
5057700 what nice fails to mention is that the medicines in question are in common use elsewhere in europe where prices are typically higher than they are here in the uk
5057701 nice has an important job to do but they need to adapt their approach for cancer medicines rather than lay the blame on the process and economics of pharmaceutical innovation
5057702 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5057703 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price

5057707 he made us laugh and laugh hard bernie mac will be sorely missed
5057708 i believe i need to move to a level where i can use confidence as a way to play better
5057709 i struggle to play my best golf when theres no pressure
5057710 the next level for me is about accepting im a three time major winner taking the confidence from that and that will help me earlier in tournaments so i dont have to put myself through the mill
5057711 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5057712 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5057713 obviously ive been the no 1 european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5057714 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week
5057715 its such a high in my career it very easily could be the last high and many players have failed at this point in the past
5057716 my body has been making people laugh since i was a teenager
5057717 i hated the music but looking back on it rock and roll was fun back then
5057718 yeah i gained even less respect for them than i had previously
5057719 the musicians are in the front making music the drummer sits behind them and bangs on things like a baboon
5057720 when youve been drumming all night long and its 8 30 in the morning and youve been shooting since 4 30 p m the day before
5057721 its very sticky on the throne as they call it
5057722 they call it a modesty pouch it has a little drawstring its remarkably similar to the pouch i used to carry my multisided dungeons and dragons dice
5057723 and one geek that i think gets short shrift is the comedy geek i was the kind of kid who would sit with a tape recorder in front of the tv for the monty pythons that would play at midnight on sundays on pbs recording on a cassette id listen to it over and over again memorizing all the songs and sketches
5057724 my parents were bohemian hippie types who lived on a houseboat in seattle in the 60s
5057725 my mom wanted to name me thucydides after the greek historian my dad wanted to name me rainer after the poet rainer maria rilke my middle name is dietrich after dietrich fischer dieskau the opera singer somehow or other it ended up being rainn with two ns go figure
5057726 it sucked when i was in junior high school and getting made fun of and slapped around a little bit
5057727 but its worked out pretty well in my professional life its a name people remember
5057728 basically what happens with every comedy script in hollywood is its shipped off to will ferrell and jack black and ben stiller
5057729 if they all pass the studio goes ok now what the expletive do we do with this
5057730 my name was on a list of five people the studio would consider to do the movie with
5057731 i met with the producers and really responded to it i love the physical comedy and the silliness of it and the rock and roll
5057732 but i also love the fact that in this time of very dark r rated comedies its a sweet movie with an almost john hughes feel a curiously old fashioned feel good comedy
5057733 rainn brings an intensity to whatever he does that makes dwight ring like a smartly tapped bell
5057734 and for dwight he combines a number of traits from classic nerds to rural types into something that is pretty unique
5057735 you wouldnt believe the number of times i get the phrase you dont understand
5057736 people in hollywood always talk about likability i kind of feel thats bull
5057737 i think if you make a character specific really make him live and breathe people will get on board likability or not
5057738 if you can see the characters heart in some way even as warped as dwight schrutes is they will get on the train and millions have gotten on the dwight train
5057739 the community had been raising red flags for months and sometimes years
5057740 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5057741 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved
5057742 this wasnt any building this was a public spectacle this was a high rise toxic vacant building that was under deconstruction

5057745 courtenay met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5057746 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5057747 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5057748 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5057749 at the start samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship she once said samanthas the father i never had
5057750 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5057751 by the summer lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5057752 she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5057753 lindsay brought men back to their house courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5057754 but the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5057755 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
5057756 if it is you will have to go otherwise well be wearing matching jumpsuits
5057757 and fight for those that hate me forget it ill choose my own death thank you
5057758 if you didnt join a gang you wouldnt be here you wouldnt be in this mess
5057759 well the streets are a rough place to live on your own and i did what i had to survive what about you the dark poet i think they call you
5057760 you could have been pink but you chose green why
5057761 theres no guarantee that they will leave you alone if you surive the war but if you were to survive what would you do then
5057762 hey dont sweat it the seventeenth is my lucky number they stick me with a needle and its nighty night
5057763 im sorry that i did kill those people it was stupid but what do i know im just a kid
5057764 yeah you chose not to fit in wear all black and write those damn poems during your days in high school and how did the authorities treat you they watched your every move tried to put you on medication and kept insisting to your parents that you should be reformed reformed what a bunch of crap its a lobotomy if anything
5057765 im a fighter a survivor and nobody was going to label me i made it on my own out there and then i got stupid i got lost and this is where i wound up my last destination
5057766 i hope not its not that im scared its just war i dont think i could ever kill someone and if they put a gun in my hand i dont think i could use it
5057767 i made my choice and you better hurry over there otherwise for those that refuse to go youll get a black jumpsuit
5057768 its a small group of people who do it and we tend to run into each other a lot at different spots around the world
5057769 a great big fat guy with a giant pistol in his hand
5057770 there are a lot of irregular forces in the field now
5057771 and you cant expect any help from the russian army the russians arent going to do anything to save a journalist especially a western one
5057772 whenever ive made predictions in a war before in afghanistan and other places ive been wrong
5057773 theres a real fear in russia these days a real distaste for things that have happened since the cold war
5057774 they believe theres an attempt by the west to surround them through the expansion of nato i dont think theyre withdrawing from georgia anytime soon theres a real chance that they country of georgia is going to get a little bit smaller and its not clear that anyone can do anything about it
5057775 i need regular sex and someone to listen to my problems at all hours of the night and occasionally bail me out of jail so youll do until someone better comes along
5057776 my dog ate it doesnt work any better this millennium than the last
5057777 romanos 8 26 39 o homem precisa de livramento que vem somente em jesus cristo que diremos pois a estas coisas se deus por n s quem ser contra n s romanos 8 31
5057778 e ouvi uma grande voz no c u que dizia agora chegada a salva o e a for a e o reino do nosso deus e o poder do seu cristo porque j o acusador de nossos irm os derrubado o qual diante do nosso deus os acusava de dia e de noite
5057779 quem nos separar do amor de cristo a tribula o ou a ang stia ou a persegui o ou a fome ou a nudez ou o perigo ou a espada
5057780 mas em todas estas coisas somos mais do que vencedores por aquele que nos amou porque estou certo de que nem a morte nem a vida nem os anjos nem os principados nem as potestades nem o presente nem o porvir nem a altura nem a profundidade nem alguma outra criatura nos poder separar do amor de deus que est em cristo jesus nosso senhor
5057781 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5057782 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5057783 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5057784 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5057785 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5057786 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5057787 as long as his family is there with him hes fine and we cope because theres no choice for us
5057788 at the time we thought she was coping well but now we see how hard it was for her
5057789 were a happy family but we live until the next check up
5057790 we realise how important it is to enjoy life when you can now we treat time with great respect
5057791 there are lots of success stories at starship and lots of sad ones too
5057792 faktilisi t endeid sellest ei ole nii et ma loodan et kui gruusia kriis nnestub lahendada siis teravad avaldused ja hvardused taanduvad ka muudest piirkondadest
5057793 we saw the tumbleweeds rolling through and decided it was time
5057794 help round out our picture of the cultural revolution for it was at its heart
5057795 i was conscious of a whole series of books and a whole publishing phenomenon of harrowing tales along the lines of jung changs wild swans
5057796 and i was concerned that that is not the complete picture for the 10 year period of the cultural revolution if we are to believe those kinds of author and their picture then it was rather like cambodia in year zero and it wasnt though sure there was great dysfunction in the country
5057797 i think the popularity of these harrowing memoirs stems from two things
5057798 the other is from an internal chinese urge which is to right the wrongs the perceived wrongs of the cultural revolution many of the people writing these memoirs have a vast sense of entitlement they are often intellectuals people whove had a good education and are possibly unconscious of this assumption that if you are educated you rule a lot of the people writing these memoirs were in positions of extraordinary privilege privilege that was possibly underlined or supported by the communist party then the red guards and others had the temerity to attack them to physically parade them in the streets and humiliate them and of course in some cases kill them destroy them there has been an urge since the end of the cultural revolution to put the world right and put the people who were the top dogs back as leaders of the pack through these harrowing memoirs a reassertion of the entitlement to rule
5057799 i was using the word ironically think of lady bracknells handbag with privileged rulers in the bracknell position
5057800 some of those attacked could hardly claim to be blameless in their own use of power and status before their worlds were turned upside down by the red guards
5057801 i would not want to play down the destruction visited upon people there was true horror but the worst excesses were over by 1969 rather than filling a whole 10 years of unending chaos the book tries to show the changing and evolving shape and atmosphere of the 10 year period most accounts chinese and foreign treat the decade as a single episode which is misleading
5057802 its always weird to see how someone from another country sees your book
5057803 two were tough and two were positive i like kinder ones better
5057804 its about the novelty of being there and the incomprehensibility factor for me i didnt know what was going on a lot of the time and it must have been like that for the first europeans its a posture of humility im trying to say that this is what happened to me
5057805 i didnt know anybody outside that community later in the book i talk about dysfunctional urban maori communities but i didnt know about them then
5057806 but i didnt set out to communicate a picture of maori new zealand today its changed in the past 20 years and i havent been there in 10 im not pretending to be an authority its funny the sense that i have a responsibility to depict the whole truth when im just trying to tell two peoples story my exposure to maori new zealand is very limited
5057807 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
5057808 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5057809 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5057810 when a man and woman are married and are living together as husband and wife and the man is neither sterile nor impotent if a child is born then the man is presumed to be the legal father of the child
5057811 there was still a twinkle in his blue eyes yeah major
5057812 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5057813 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5057814 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody
5057815 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5057816 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up
5057817 you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5057818 but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5057819 people are different they have different chemistry they have different lives
5057820 its not about years its about going out with somebody being truthful on the way in being truthful in the middle and being truthful on the way out
5057821 why are you asking me that question im being as honest as i can possibly can be
5057822 i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time
5057823 i guarantee you that 20 percent of the people on this street right now who are in a relationship wish they could get out but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships
5057824 i just feel like spending a million dollars right now to put a mirror in every
5057825 and im not the first im the second one and thats it theres no lying theres no b llshit i just dont want to be followed around new york city like an animal
5057826 if she said she wants kids and hes not ready thats not being needy its being honest
5057827 it will be a landmark by election it will be a deciding factor for anwar
5057828 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
5057829 it is a historic moment for malaysians especially the silent majority to convey how they want the nation to move ahead
5057830 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5057831 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5057832 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5057833 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5057834 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5057835 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5057836 clinton approved iranian arms transfers help turn bosnia into militant islamic base
5057837 most a my heroes exist as myths so i cheer for my friends instead
5057838 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5057839 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5057840 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5057841 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5057842 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5057843 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5057844 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5057845 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5057846 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5057847 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5057848 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5057849 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5057850 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5057851 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5057852 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5057853 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5057854 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5057855 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5057856 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5057857 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5057858 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5057859 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5057860 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5057861 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5057862 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5057863 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5057864 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5057865 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5057866 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5057867 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5057868 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5057869 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5057870 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5057871 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5057872 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5057873 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5057874 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5057875 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5057876 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5057877 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5057878 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5057879 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5057880 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5057881 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
5057882 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
5057883 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
5057884 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
5057885 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
5057886 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
5057887 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
5057888 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
5057889 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
5057890 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
5057891 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
5057892 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5057893 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5057894 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5057895 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5057896 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5057897 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5057898 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5057899 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5057900 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5057901 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5057902 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5057903 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
5057904 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
5057905 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
5057906 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
5057907 unless they bring some comprehensive changes in the security this deployment will not affect peoples confidence
5057908 people are afraid to leave their house after 7 p m
5057909 i am still a student but this was an order from the commander of the academy that we should come out and search the vehicles
5057910 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5057911 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5057912 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5057913 frankly we dont trust the iraqi police one hundred percent
5057914 when the aug 8 bomb went off in tal afar the police joined with the civilians to attack sunnis when we didnt join the fight they called us terrorists

5057944 when i came back i thought id add my own touch

5057947 there are repercussions if a single person can perform a great action and set a good example im sure there will a great deal of enthusiasm in my country for my victory

5057957 now he has said that tomorrow midday russian forces will withdraw and withdraw to their pre aug 6 7 lines this time i hope he means it
5057958 georgia if it wants to become a member of nato will become one
5057959 this must happen not in several weeks but in the coming days
5057960 they said they have two options move toward tbilisi or withdraw
5057961 why would they roam around western georgia and scare people cut off supply lines and make sure until the civil administration erodes and gradually collapses if this was not the objective
5057962 i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part
5057963 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution

5058054 december 4 1959 federal elections day in nigeria from north and south we all struggled to win most struggles ended in

5058056 we cannot build a nation in which a handful of people exclusively own and control the means of production and distribution to the detriment of the majority
5058057 for too long we have ben kicked around for too long we have been treated like adolescents who cannot discern their interest and act accordingly
5058058 and so my friends the lesson to be learned from our tragic struggle is the lesson of unity
5058059 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5058060 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5058061 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
5058062 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5058063 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
5058064 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
5058065 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5058066 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
5058067 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5058068 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5058069 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5058070 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
5058071 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
5058072 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
5058073 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5058074 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
5058075 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
5058076 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
5058077 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5058078 the whole point of calculating the portfolio twr is to remove the effect of cash flows on performance thereby making a comparison to a benchmark relevent the benchmark returns do not have any cash flows associated with them and neither does the portfolios twr so its an apples to apples comparison
5058079 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5058080 say you had 10 000 at the beginning of the year and your investments did great in the first 3 months your 10 000 turned into 12 000 without you adding a penny now on april 1 you put in 20 000 more but your investments stalled in the rest of the year and you end the year with 32 000 so you made 20 on 10 000 in the first 3 months and you made 0 on 32 000 in the next 9 months if you plug in these values in a spreadsheet and use the xirr function you get 8 this makes sense because 10000 1 8 1 4 10194 10194 20000 1 8 3 4 31988 pretty close except for rounding if you didnt put in additional 20 000 on april 1 your return wouldve been 20 thats how your investment choices did and thats how fidelity or schwab will report to you theres a big difference between the 8 dollar weighted rate of return and the 20 time weighted rate of return because the cash flow in this example is unusually large if we change the additional contribution on april 1 from 20 000 to 1 000 and have the end of year value at 13 000 instead of 32 000 the two returns would be much closer the dollar weighted rate of return would be 18 6 and the time weighted rate of return would still be 20

5058083 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5058084 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5058094 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5058095 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
5058096 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem

5058147 las luces eran bien brillantes m s fuertes que el sol aunque de aspecto met lico
5058148 el objeto era un tipo de plato como un trompo de esos que los ni os hacen girar que al medio ten a como un vidrio que parec a vidrioso donde estaba la luminosidad la luz de distintos colores
5058149 entonces me acerqu a unos 10 metros aproximadamente sobre el play n que est a rriba del cerro

5058159 i talked to stew and last year we got after those guys and blitzed them a lot
5058160 he said that he got some e mail from some offensive coordinators saying this must be youre first time being an defensive coordinator because you broke the etiquette of just playing vanilla we did a lot of base stuff i would have loved to really get after them but we played what was called

5058175 aired the tapes as evidence of a secret national party agenda when there is no such evidence
5058176 in the real world forensics are corroborative they dont solve crimes
5058177 get back to the old fashioned notion of cops sitting there and slowly working things out
5058178 we make it credible but are not hidebound by bureaucratic accuracy
5058179 der name des herrn ist ein festes schloss der gerechte l uft dahin und wird beschirmt

5058181 on a long term view and on a fundamentals view i am very comfortable with the outlook a year from now for the likes of potash corp and other companies like it we think they will be generating significant earnings
5058182 we dont look at this sector as a bear market we look at it as a correction and we expected the correction
5058183 the chinese are not in the drivers seat here to negotiate from a point of strength they need the volumes and they have no second choice
5058184 i think next year we are going to see a bigger bump in volumes than in prices any price gains next year will be more marginal and more opportunistic rather than fundamental
5058185 the thing to remember is that farmers both here and abroad have not been confronted with these extremely high potash prices the demand destruction will be substantial but it has not occurred yet
5058186 oh its because were using nature identical tomatoes its a synthetic flavour and i said
5058187 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5058188 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5058189 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5058190 is the constitutional grant of authority to ban mere possession of cocaine today
5058191 the impropriety of nullification emanates from the notion that ours is a government of laws and not of men
5058192 it is not only the jurors right but his duty to find the verdict according to his own best understanding judgment and conscience though in direct opposition to the direction of the court
5058193 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
5058194 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
5058195 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5058196 i think its unlikely but i told senator obama im going to help him in whatever way he thinks im helpful
5058197 im a little confused as to the medias portrayal of glenn spagnuolo and the members of re create 68 as violent extremists
5058198 the controversy seems to stem from re create 68s refusal to disallow the right to self defense to its members re create 68s explanation of this refusal is clear there will be people protesting with re create 68 arm in arm with their children and elders in large part these will be representatives of communities which have most suffered from the never ending betrayal of the democrats to attempt to deny them the right to defend themselves is to deny a fundamental human right
5058199 cynthia mckinney green party candidate for president and rosa clemente green party candidate for vice president are not participating in any recreate 68 activities both candidates and the green party of colorado are refuting this announcement and are stating that neither candidate nor the green party of colorado are in any way associated with recreate 68 nor will any of their candidates be speaking at or attending any event nor are they in any way associated with the group recreate 68
5058200 the usa is busy with its own missile defense system it does not intend to defend poland at this point poland lays itself open to attack giving the usa a permission to deploy the system the country may become an object of russias reaction such targets are destroyed in the first instance
5058201 it clearly states that we can use nuclear weapons against the countries possessing nuclear weapons against allies of such countries if they somehow support them and against those countries which deploy other countries nuclear weapons on their territories poland is aware of it
5058202 i think im going to go hiking next saturday fortunately deborah wanted to come along with me

5058204 our study should encourage further research to identify potentially remediable factors related to delivery of care to reduce morbidity and mortality in more elderly patients with stroke
5058205 the recognition of this growing problem may help to implement strategies aimed at involving more elderly subjects in clinical trials and other research
5058206 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5058207 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5058208 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5058209 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5058210 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5058211 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5058212 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5058213 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5058214 and i would say i hope it is sensational when we work a story well probably take the most sensational angle and put it in the headline and blast it to catch your attention
5058215 a big news event with accompanying photograph a major celebrity doing something that they said they werent doing
5058216 because she went on a diet talked about the diet recently and these pics indicate it was not too successful
5058217 his face looks sunken now where it did not before
5058218 the first time we named rielle hunter as lover and revealed she was 6 months pregnant and got the exclusive photo of her
5058219 ok so its 2 40 in the morning and theres a basement lobby i approached him and i said mr edwards alexander hitchen from the national enquirer would you like to explain why you were with your mistress rielle hunter and your love child tonight
5058220 at that point he went white and ran into a restroom i tried to open the door and hes pushing and pulling
5058221 that is the sixty four thousand million dollar question isnt it
5058222 the national enquirer gives the story cooties for all the times and boston globes the washington posts of the world that is partly because thirty years forty fifty years ago the national enquirer was very different than today it is this low brow celebrity scandal mongering thing
5058223 but you know we do pretty well thats not to say we get everything right we dont but you show the newspaper that does ill start subscribing to it right now
5058224 it left the bloody footprints at the murder scene he said he never owned those ugly ass shoes that was his famous quote and nobody could find a photograph of him wearing them we found the photograph
5058225 i think this john edwards case will be a moment well look back in three five ten years hence and say that was one of the moments when the main street media realized that they cant make assumptions about the truth of a story based on where it popped up
5058226 i think well send a reporter or two over there and nose around and see what we find out
5058227 stop stop i dont want to go there i do not like it
5058228 and theres some places i dont want to go and in this case we really have tried to stay away from that aspect of the story
5058229 i want to hit the news element of the story i want to hit the fact that a man running for president had an affair and then lied about it to the american public and you know darn near blew up his own political party while doing it
5058230 contento de volver a repetir una medalla para mi pa s eso me tiene muy emocionado quer a ganar lo de atenas sucedi hace cuatro a os y eso en la carrera de un tenista es mucho tiempo y me deja feliz el haberme mantenido en un gran nivel

5058233 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

5058240 i think they had some good moments and not so good moments
5058241 i think they both showed they can move the football in this league
5058242 generic answers to any football question you can think of
5058243 the gains made in adhering to the rule of law may outweigh the painful losses of ancestral homes
5058244 a commitment to the international community and we have a responsibility to keep it
5058245 we are going straight to the place and were going to be happy
5058246 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5058247 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5058248 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5058249 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5058250 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5058251 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5058252 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5058253 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5058254 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5058255 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5058256 this is a planning took where all things are going
5058257 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5058258 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5058259 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5058260 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5058261 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5058262 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5058263 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5058264 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5058265 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5058266 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5058267 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5058268 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5058269 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5058270 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5058271 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5058272 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5058273 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5058274 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5058275 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5058276 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5058277 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5058278 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5058279 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5058280 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5058281 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5058282 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5058283 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5058284 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5058285 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5058286 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5058287 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5058288 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5058289 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5058290 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5058291 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5058292 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5058293 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5058294 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5058295 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5058296 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5058297 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5058298 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5058299 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5058300 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5058301 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5058302 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5058303 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5058304 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5058305 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5058306 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5058307 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5058308 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5058309 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5058310 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5058311 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5058312 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5058313 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5058314 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5058315 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5058316 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5058317 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5058318 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5058319 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5058320 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5058321 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5058322 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5058323 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5058324 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5058325 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5058326 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5058327 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5058328 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5058329 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5058330 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5058331 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5058332 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5058333 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5058334 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5058335 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5058336 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5058337 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5058338 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5058339 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5058340 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5058341 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5058342 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5058343 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5058344 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5058345 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5058346 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5058347 apr s avoir battu notre adversaire sur son terrain il n tait pas question de conna tre la d faite ici
5058348 on a bien attaqu les deux premiers jours on a bataill le vendredi avec mikko hirvonen et on a r ussi faire un petit cart puis le samedi on a continu attaquer pour creuser le trou globalement c tait une course bien g r e

5058353 on monday its richard dawkinss turn yet again to take up the cudgels against religious faith in a two part channel 4 programme the root of all evil
5058354 behind unsubstantiated assertions sweeping generalisations and random anecdotal evidence theres the unmistakable whiff of panic they fear religion is on the march again
5058355 theres an aggrieved frustration that theyve been short changed by history we were supposed to be all atheist rationalists by now
5058356 theres an underlying anxiety that atheist humanism has failed over the 20th century atheist political regimes racked up an appalling and unmatched record for violence
5058357 this is the only context that can explain dawkinss programme
5058358 sadly there is no evolution of thought in dawkinss position he has been saying much the same thing about religion for a long time
5058359 first dawkins is featured in jerusalem the point is that religion causes violence
5058360 how dare you make fun of a vietnam veteran and get a hair cut young man
5058361 the brrs bruces rave and rant of the world are the cause of the poor education our children receive in maths and the numerical sciences at least
5058362 meaningless sites like bwuces rave and five pubes is a waste of time
5058363 i was worried we would not have a minyan its nearly 8 00 oclock now and ive yahrzeit for maariv
5058364 reb talisman perhaps for your wife or your parents you have yahrzeit

5058366 abba its 8 05 time for mincha we have a minyan
5058367 if only shed be home when i pull into the driveway
5058368 how nice it would have been to tell her about reb talisman maybe tomorrow
5058369 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5058370 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5058371 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5058372 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5058373 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5058374 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5058375 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5058376 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5058377 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5058378 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5058379 did you know richard nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist
5058380 not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
5058381 people werent creating and posting videos online there was jibjab a website but that was done by a production crew what youre seeing now are individuals participating in the process and thats really exciting
5058382 so often with these its not the huge production values that make them work
5058383 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
5058384 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged
5058385 then of course theres just so much to rip on
5058386 the guy who sits on the sidelines teaching the white guy valuable lessons like bagger vance the big magical brother from the green mile or when shaq played kazaam
5058387 i want to bomb iran using solar powered nuclear weapons
5058388 apple butter will no longer be a second class condiment dinner shouldnt be so spicy sen mccain promises never to negotiate with prussia and yes if elected sen mccain will vote yes on cats being soft
5058389 whenever i get on a plane i know who the air marshal is its always the guy holding the people magazine upside down looking right at me
5058390 looks like the guy at the hardware store who makes the keys
5058391 i have the oldness it takes to protect america honor her love her and tell her what cute things the cat did
5058392 act now and dont delay we know he doesnt have much experience and isnt ready to lead but that doesnt mean he isnt dreamy
5058393 we can start up that rumor about you having a black baby with a prostitute
5058394 but sir it would be healthier for the two if they were separated
5058395 mccain supports universal health care for all current and former pows
5058396 john edwards presidential aspirant and author of the famed claim that there are two americas was apparently only faithful to his wife in one of them apparently he didnt realize that the national enquirer had reporters stationed in the other america where he was in fact having an affair with his videographer
5058397 obamas camp initially agreed that the cartoon was quote tasteless and offensive really you know what your response should have been its very easy here let me put the statement out for you barack obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons muslim extremists
5058398 barack obama heading to hawaii for a vacation with his family
5058399 republicans say that john mccain will be good for business they didnt say what business but im guessing probably the scooter store doans pills craftmatic adjustable bed and the miracle ear
5058400 people are now talking about the ticket barack obama and hillary clinton would that be a good ticket and i think this would be the first if you think about it first combination of an african american man and a white woman since well michael jackson
5058401 barack obama gave a speech in germany and 200 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
5058402 barack obama said today that he is going to fight for votes in all 50 states yeah thats what he said meanwhile john mccain said hes going to fight for votes in all 13 colonies
5058403 ralph nader in the news this week ralph nader announced that he is certified to be on the presidential ballot in 12 states however doctors say that nader is certifiable in all 50 states
5058404 barack obama still continuing to dominate media coverage the new york times just did a big piece they say that barack obama has been successful in politics because hes a black man who doesnt make white people feel threatened yeah yeah which explains obamas secret service code name al roker

5058408 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5058409 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue its immoral to keep kicking the can down the road for younger generations to grapple
5058410 designed and constructed to ensure proper conveyance of floodwaters and to eliminate the potential to cause backwater flooding on either side of the u s mexico border
5058411 remove debris from the fence within washes arroyos immediately after rain events to ensure that no backwater flooding occurs
5058412 the callousness displayed by homeland security in ignoring warnings to damage a national treasure is mind boggling
5058413 the border wall does not stop humans but it will stop jaguars and other wildlife it is already wreaking havoc on the southern part of organ pipe national monument
5058414 the contrast between the report findings and the environmental assessment displays the bush administrations wholly meaningless approach to environmental analysis
5058415 ive taken the action because someone had to this government is trying to force this on the people and someone had to stand up and say that there is no evidence to support it
5058416 on the face of it this applicant would seem to face some insurmountable obstacles in bringing this action
5058417 i want to win if i lose what a tragedy to think about that 2 billion plus that our country will give for no return each year im not going to let that happen without attempting to stop it
5058418 people try to put us down just because we get around

5058463 we are now engaged in a great civil war testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure
5058464 thats enough chuck it may be your opinion but its not language authorized for public consumption
5058465 blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every area of human endeavor
5058466 underneath the nation is roiling americans know something without a name is undermining the nation turning the mind mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right from wrong and they dont like it
5058467 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
5058468 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
5058469 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
5058470 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
5058471 es reicht nicht wenn man nur 90 prozent an akkuratesse gibt
5058472 die pferde waren in schuss alle haben sich gut verstanden vielleicht hatten wir etwas zu viel harmonie manchmal muss man auch einen reizpunkt setzen
5058473 unsere taktik dass wir locker in die erste qualifikation gegangen sind war richtig das haben wir immer so gemacht nur dieses mal ging unser plan nicht auf

5058488 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

5058490 unless they bring some comprehensive changes in the security this deployment will not affect peoples confidence

5058495 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5058496 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long

5058499 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5058500 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5058501 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5058502 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5058503 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5058504 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5058505 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5058506 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5058507 low informati may 21 22 study by princeton survey research assoc
5058508 i just realized from my own knowledge that some o get a job any job
5058509 low informati may 21 22 study by princeton survey research assoc

5058511 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
5058512 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
5058513 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5058514 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5058515 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5058516 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5058517 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5058518 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5058519 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5058520 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5058521 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5058522 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5058523 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5058524 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5058525 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5058526 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5058527 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5058528 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5058529 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost

5058534 weve been successful in rec leagues but we really got a taste of what winning can be like in baseball
5058535 i think i really learned in the spring that all the hard work you put in really pays off
5058536 we worked hard the whole season to get where we were capable of going and now we all believe we can go as far as we can push ourselves
5058537 i know i feel im going to be more successful because i was given the opportunity last year
5058538 the game has slowed down for me and i believe the experience from last year will pay off
5058539 weve been successful in rec leagues but we really got a taste of what winning can be like in baseball
5058540 i think i really learned in the spring that all the hard work you put in really pays off

5058542 i know i feel im going to be more successful because i was given the opportunity last year
5058543 the game has slowed down for me and i believe the experience from last year will pay off
5058544 a problem last year was that we thought ahead way too early
5058545 the way we ended last season was a nice step but these kids believed all along theyd be successful a year later
5058546 the players on this years team have had high expectations since they entered the program where this team is right now though were still building an identity were still a work in progress
5058547 believe me our guys know how important our first three games are
5058548 that message has been sent all summer it is being sent now and that will continue to be the case if you lose your first game and you lose the second playing wayne hills in game no 3 has a different feel to it
5058549 we dusted ourselves off and got up played even harder the rest of the season and thats what youve got to do
5058550 wayne hills is a great team and 40 straight wins is an unbelievable streak that they have
5058551 sometimes if you start winning and you start believing in it it becomes a habit and that goes for losing too
5058552 a problem last year was that we thought ahead way too early
5058553 the way we ended last season was a nice step but these kids believed all along theyd be successful a year later
5058554 the players on this years team have had high expectations since they entered the program where this team is right now though were still building an identity were still a work in progress
5058555 believe me our guys know how important our first three games are
5058556 that message has been sent all summer it is being sent now and that will continue to be the case if you lose your first game and you lose the second playing wayne hills in game no 3 has a different feel to it
5058557 we dusted ourselves off and got up played even harder the rest of the season and thats what youve got to do
5058558 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5058559 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5058560 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5058561 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5058562 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills

5058567 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5058568 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5058569 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5058570 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5058571 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror

5058831 i realize that means taking up a good portion of your time so ill pay double your firms going land rate and tip you the same templars tower south entrance
5058832 paulo you really must have your cousin give me the name of her aesthetician gaining five or six inches of height is quite the feat
5058833 before we get to what your silence will cost maree might i ask how long youve known
5058834 for more than three years a little after your aunt started calling you almost every day with updates about ginas pregnancy
5058835 please paulo ive always thought you were a selfish classist prick but even i always admired you for not cutting all your family loose when you took your vows youre an honorable man who does his job as best and humanely as he can unlike good old kevan who could probably tell a joke while putting a man down no one thought twice about your interest in your widowed cousins pregnancy including me hell i remember that party your aunt threw for you when you got that commendation almost five years ago you and original formula gina were tight like twins
5058836 aside from then i havent had any of you anywhere near my family the pregnancy was more than a year later the only new pics of family ive ever had in the office were of my niece
5058837 i had a really maternal day shortly after we all realized your so called cousin was expecting started regretting that i would never give birth actually took a slipcar to your aunts new house to give your cousin a gift for the baby i saw a pregnant woman gardening with your aunt i realized right away it wasnt gina when she stood up even with the cosmetic changes and i had the driver move on
5058838 youve held onto this for a long time maree you never struck me as the extortionist type what is it you need or want
5058839 paulo you are going to expose me for a traitor and terrorist
5058840 maree that is even less you than the role of blackmailer is are you off on some cloak and blade escapade
5058841 i have played everyone in the vatican for fools my entire career paulo and ive been played a fool myself by well youll know who i work for soon enough the less real information you know the better for the lies you need to tell it ends today paulo with us getting back in that car and heading to the slipgate station while we are en route you are going to begin making calls starting with my own linkpad code i will not answer your call you will try again using the emergency mode i still will not answer then you will call the tower you will tell security to lock down my slipchair and to secure everything in the suite that is mine
5058842 and tell her what you have done you will tell her i seemed to be acting strangely yesterday especially when we all left the tower you will tell her it didnt seem like much at the time but it suddenly hit you this morning that the holo emitter in my slipchair has been misfiring an awful lot lately and you sense there is a connection if you think you need to tell her you saw me fiddling with my chairs servpanel a lot too whenever you and i were alone in the suite you will tell her i am avoiding your calls this morning which is awfully strange with the mysterious death of a pope and all the chaos of the upcoming millennial you will tell her you remember that i have some family in astoria and that all of them men women and children should be detained by local authorities immediately until you all can sort out whats up with me
5058843 paulo that part of my family has nothing to do with anything but if they are not detained they will be murdered for the love of god do all this and do it without question they may already be dead or worse because of what im doing now this slipcars detour and the body in the trunk that hasnt reported in yet will not go unnoticed

5058863 im pleased with that we do want to keep in perspective that it was a preseason game although preseason games are important naturally in the development of the offense defense and special teams and the cohesiveness of the group
5058864 just to recap the game i think the defense started strong we gave ourselves a defensible position
5058865 in the first half efficiency was not very good and that lasted the whole game so i think we have a long road to go we have a lot of work to do before we get there
5058866 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5058867 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5058868 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5058869 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

5058874 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5058875 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5058952 the change in sentiment is consequent to the softening in commodity prices including crude oil globally marginal decline in domestic bond yields and hopes of acceleration in banking reforms and moderation in inflation
5058953 inflation is likely to remain high for some time and we dont expect any softening in interest rates till then we may possibly see some more tightening by rbi
5058954 there is some more pain left before things improve for banks
5058955 in any downturn the asset quality tends to deteriorate but unlike in the past the recovery systems for banks including debt recovery tribunal implementation of sarfesi act etc are much stronger
5058956 in a slowdown npas can increase which is a cyclical risk but are there signs of any secular deterioration certainly not
5058957 due to various reasons including the fall in stock markets the corporate finance activities have improved this is on account of critical projects including infrastructure and capex where demand for credit is unlike to wane
5058958 if you look at the last 15 years the nims of banks have averaged around 3 per cent which is across interest rate cycles this is because banks are a classic pass through mechanism if you look at the recent hikes banks have passed on the cost increase through plr hikes so any pressure on margins will be temporary and over a period margins will remain stable and possibly inch up
5058959 margins should not correct from current levels and are likely to be maintained as banks are also increasing lending rates
5058960 some of the real estate players are land bank rich but cash poor
5058961 due to rising cost of funding and high real estate cost there is a significant pressure on margins alternatives such as private equity or mezzanine funding are becoming popular public markets are not an easy option considering the unfavourable market conditions and due to the prevalent guidelines external debt is not possible
5058962 high interest rates may force realty players to scale down the size of their projects and offer sops to attract investors
5058963 cars are a discretionary spend and the increase in interest rates will force the buyer to rethink on the decision
5058964 normally the federal election commission tries to root out infractions and loopholes fining campaigns for incomplete reporting or for taking shortcuts around spending limits in the early months of a campaign season

5058984 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5058985 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5058986 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5058987 georgia will if it wants and it does want to become a member of nato
5058988 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear
5058989 people used to be taught sequentially that notion has shifted because of things like the internet where you really dont need to know prerequisite information to search out whats useful for you that makes it difficult for some museums that rely on things like chronology the challenge for institutions is to find ways to have different points of contact for the visitor
5058990 the shift was that it was not so much about understanding the airplane but the human achievement of lindbergh sitting in that cramped cockpit for 23 hours
5058991 you have to read a lot on the boards and the kids get bored this is an excellent way to keep them occupied and then they will want to come back
5058992 the february break was one of the best weeks weve ever had
5058993 in talking to many of the families that were here many said they normally go away they go skiing or to florida but not this year so they came to the museum the flip side is that were very concerned about our endowment and the rising costs of fuel and electricity is impacting our budget tremendously
5058994 museums do well in a slow economy because they are a form of family entertainment that is relatively affordable
5058995 the average admission cost at a museum is six dollars and many museums are free
5058996 we expect to see less giving this year because of tighter budgets
5058997 we cut budgets that we had raised at the end of last year after everything started to fall apart
5058998 its difficult to find stuff that will both serve your mission and be alluring to people
5058999 kids today are so steeped in things that are interactive and electronic so museums are looking a lot more at how they can be more hands on

5059001 partisan haggling at the monroe county legislature tuesday night was yet another classic example of why so little gets done to move this community forward

5059073 as a parent of two children i can proudly admit i am an avid member 4 years of sittercity every babysitter ive had in the past 4 years has come from this fantastic website it provides every piece of information a parent would request in a babysitter age proximity to your home transportation language options certifications experience references etc i tried searching for babysitters in my area via recommendations of friends but those leads never seemed to pan out when we moved to a new neighborhood we found few parents were willing to recommend their own babysitters out of fear they may lose them to us of the few neighborhood kids left available the high school kids seemed to be too involved in after school or weekend activities in addition they were unable to drive themselves which put me feeling uneasy driving them home after a long night out the college students often returned home for the holidays or long weekends which is when we wanted to go out so where else were we to turn my computer savy husband linked onto the sittercity website and we have been hooked ever since we now get sitters who are eager to babysit have their own transportation and can even babysit overnight our social lives have changed completely our marriage is better than ever due to the amount of social time we are able to spend with one another our friends now call us more often because they now know there is a great chance we can meet them out by going out with our old friends we have been introduced to many new friends as well i havent experienced such fun since college i have recommended this website to over a dozen friends and family members my brother shared his frustrations with babysitters when he recently moved he finally took my advice and he too has stated it changed his life he and his wife now have date nights once a week and have become closer than ever as a parent it is essential to maintain your relationship with your spouse in order to provide a stable and fulfilling environment for your children if you are unhappy your children are likely unhappy having a slew of babysitters available prevents parents from making excuses to not go out instead they can get out on the social scene and unwind i know for me when i return to my children after a night to myself i am more tolerant and a much happier mom thanks for providing this life altering website an oak brook il family

5059089 you might be surprised to find out that your neighbour next door has a lower interest rate on his mortgage than you do even though you bought your properties at about the same time this has happened to thousands of americans countrywide but well tell you why that is the case being so competitive the mortgage market always has a tradeoff between loan closing costs amp interest rates charged your neighbour who got the lower interest rate may have paid a lot more in closing costs than you did and thats why he has a lower interest rate whats more a large portion of those closing costs may have been added to the loan balance making it seem like he got a really good deal because he did not have to pay cash for closing costs so how can you balance the tradeoff between closing costs amp interest rates making sure to pay the least in closing costs and getting the lowest interest rate possible we will show you how to shop for mortgages and compare their real costs of borrowing

5059112 no news publication has dared to barely scratch the surface like this before
5059113 this profile sets a benchmark for mindless filler by which all other features about sen obama will now be judged just impressive puff journalism all around
5059114 the sheer breadth of fluff in this story is something to be marveled at
5059115 its all here favorite books movies meals and seasons of the year ranked one through four sure we asked obama what his favorite ice cream was but
5059116 when the american people cast their vote this november this is the piece of fluff theyre going to remember
5059117 not the ones by newsweek harpers the new yorker the atlantic the new republic the economist nightline the wall street journal or even that story about lessons obama learned from his first grade teacher we ran a month ago
5059118 my editors told me that if i wanted to uncover the most frivolous trivial information on obama i had to be prepared to follow the puff
5059119 that meant that not only did i have to stay and watch sen obama play endless games of basketball with city firemen to show readers how athletic and youthful he is but i also had to go to nba shooting experts to learn what aspects of his jump shot are good and what parts are great
5059120 if we were going to get the story we wanted it was my responsibility as a journalist to ask the really tough questions to his two young daughters
5059121 i also had to capitalize on every opportunity to compare the story of obamas upbringing and rise to power to that of martin luther king jr s and john f kennedys no matter how suspect those parallels really are
5059122 situations like these are when you have to get on the phone and talk not only to his mother but to his aunt his uncle a boy scout leader or maybe even one of his camp counselors growing up
5059123 and if they dont return your call you turn to sunday school teachers and former babysitters anyone who is willing to go on record and say that barack obama was a really good kid who was destined for great things
5059124 im not quite sure how he intends to turn around the economy or get us out of iraq
5059125 what an idiot this completely ruins any chance he had of becoming president

5059141 they were a much much stronger boat this year theyre such a solid group and theyre determined thats all it takes
5059142 we know its a lot of stress and anything can happen for him to hang on and have a little bit of kick left in there is just incredible it was just an amazing outcome we couldnt be happier for him
5059143 na het verhaaltje krijg ik nog een kus en dan gaat papa of mama weg fijn dan kan ik beginnen eerst moeten mijn voeten boven de dekens anders kom ik nergens het is even wroeten maar daar zijn ze mijn tenen daar kan ik even lekker op knabbelen als ik uitgeknabbeld ben gebruik ik de spijlen van mijn bedje als ladder zo kan ik 180 graden draaien en kom ik met mijn hoofd aan het voeteneind terecht vervolgens is het tijd om mijn speen uit bed te gooien het is van groot belang dat ik dit doe aan de kant van de muur anders vindt mama hem te snel vervolgens ga ik op mijn buik liggen en maak ik vreemde geluiden dan weet mama dat het avond ritueel kan beginnen ja hoor daar is mama al verbaasd kijkt mama me aan en ze vraagt me waarom ik ondersteboven en achterstevoren in bed lig en waar mijn speen is dat vertel ik uiteraard niet dan zou dit hele ritueel niet leuk meer zijn mama zoekt mijn speen in bed onder mijn buik naast het bed en onder het bed ze zucht en gaat plat op haar buik liggen wurmt haar arm onder mijn bedje en zoekt de speen ze komt altijd een beetje klem te zitten hahaha vanuit deze positie heb ik uitstekend uitzicht op het rode hoofd van mijn mama door de spijlen van mijn bed kijkt mama me aan en moet lachen mama vindt dit net zo leuk als ik ik krijg mijn speen terug en mama legt me opnieuw recht in bed en onder de dekens h h kan ik eindelijk slapen

5059157 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5059158 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5059159 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5059160 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5059161 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5059162 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5059163 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5059164 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5059165 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5059166 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5059167 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5059168 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5059169 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5059170 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5059171 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5059172 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5059173 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5059174 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5059175 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5059176 there is no doubt that the us wants to change the command structure as things have deteriorated in afghanistan
5059177 he deserves every ounce of respect and admiration and attention that he gets because what hes doing is incredibly phenomenal
5059178 being his teammate for so many years you get desensitized to how amazing he is i think many years down the road me and the other members of the team will realize what an incredible performance he put on for everybody here
5059179 i mean its something im incredibly proud of but it was never a goal of mine to be the most decorated female swimmer or anything like that im very happy with the six medals i have hopefully ill get some more in london
5059180 to enjoy all these places that ive been to for swim meets and never seen anything but the pool and hotel
5059181 i think i forced myself to get back in too early after athens
5059182 i had a real lack of motivation the first practice i want to be excited about by staying physically in good shape and staying away from competition i think ill shoot back fast
5059183 ive got my wedding coming up so i want to be in good shape
5059184 it took a lot of pressure off me for the rest of the meet
5059185 i remember leaving athens i was like wow i dont remember that
5059186 i was just overwhelmed with the entire experience i think that gave me a bit of an advantage this time i did make a conscious effort to stay present in the moment

5059199 a friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words
5059200 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5059201 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5059202 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5059203 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5059204 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5059205 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5059206 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5059207 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5059208 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5059209 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5059210 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5059211 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5059212 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5059213 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
5059214 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5059215 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5059216 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5059217 it cant be described well never ever see it again
5059218 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
5059219 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5059220 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5059221 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
5059222 oooooooooh my names perry all my blogs concern people perhaps being racist and songs about the eec if i cant be arse doing that ill stick the cast of last of the summer wines faces onto people having sex all with some fagin esque estuary english to make it seem funny than it is guvnor i wish i could be more like dave who tackles todays issue in a stark sobering and common sense manner only writtern about in legend i couldnt do it
5059223 you know yall were like let me get four tickets to the funeral hes still the hottest ticket in town
5059224 michelle and i were so deeply sad to hear about your loss
5059225 he made us laugh and laugh hard bernie mac will be sorely missed
5059226 he represented chicago in a way that he knew the street he knew the people and thats why hes the king of comedy
5059227 he wanted to do something personally to get children away from the life of violence he had a heart and passion thats why as the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
5059228 the only remaining questions now are how long will president musharraf stay in power and how soon he will go the question of his making a comeback simply doesnt arise
5059229 the military is neutral but would they remain neutral when they see a former army chief being insulted
5059230 ive had second thoughts believe me ive been really nervous all the jokes from friends involve death
5059231 youre going to actually sit on my lap is that ok
5059232 are you going to ask me what i want for christmas
5059233 thanks for the lesson in wafer thin comic book morality there oh did i say comic book yes yes i did throwaway rubbish read by kids somehow the director and his screenwriting brother confused a childrens magazine with citzen kane where was the fucking fun its a comic book why does a comic book need to be two and a half hours long and contain bullshit themes and underlying crap that get in the way of a bloke in a suit with his underpants on the outside fighting a monster what the hell is this shakespeare
5059234 well i may not have a wife back home slaving over a hot stove but i did teabag some drunk bitch with an l plate over her neck last fortnight yes gran i teabagged her
5059235 wir haben mit dem bike heute einen weiteren schritt nach vorne gemacht es war aber gewiss nicht einfach dieses ergebnis einzufahren
5059236 wir sind ohne testdaten nach br nn gekommen doch das team hat mit dem setup tolle arbeit geleistet ich muss honda und gresini daf r danken dass ich dieses motorrad fahren durfte f r mich ist das eine gro artige m glichkeit meine bisherigen resultate zu toppen
5059237 ich bin entt uscht dar ber am start positionen eingeb t zu haben denn ich bin mit einem anderen fahrer kollidiert auf der anderen seite bin ich auch sehr froh mich davon erholt und den vierten platz eingefahren zu haben damit kann ich wirklich zufrieden sein
5059238 auch wenn ich das rennen als bester satellitenfahrer beendet habe so richtig zufrieden stellend ist das ergebnis nicht
5059239 wir hatten eigentlich erwartet in den top 6 zu landen so weit waren wir nicht von diesem ziel entfernt aber so hatten wir uns das rennen gewiss nicht vorgestellt
5059240 leider habe ich nach der ersten runde einige r nge verloren
5059241 leider habe ich nach der ersten runde einige r nge verloren ich habe zwar flei ig berholt habe aber die positionen wieder an andere piloten abgeben m ssen weil diese auf der gerade einfach schneller waren
5059242 morgen werden wir aus dem test das beste machen und uns vor meinem heim grand prix in misano weiter verbessern das rennen dort ist mir besonders wichtig
5059243 unsere beiden fahrer haben ein gutes rennen gezeigt shinya hat deutlich gemacht dass er auf dem neuen bike einen schritt nach vorne machen kann ich bin mir sicher dass ihm der vierte platz einen willkommenen schub geben wird jetzt bekommen wir noch mehr zeit um dieses motorrad noch besser kennen zu lernen wir haben vor weitere verbesserungen vorzunehmen obwohl das schon ein viel versprechendes deb t war
5059244 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5059245 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5059246 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5059247 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5059248 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5059249 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5059250 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5059251 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5059252 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5059253 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5059254 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5059255 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5059256 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5059257 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5059258 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5059259 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5059260 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5059261 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5059262 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5059263 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5059264 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5059265 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5059266 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5059267 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5059268 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5059269 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5059270 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5059271 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5059272 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5059273 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5059274 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5059275 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5059276 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5059277 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5059278 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5059279 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5059280 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5059281 who are open to doing something on the production side
5059282 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5059283 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5059284 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5059285 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5059286 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5059287 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5059288 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5059289 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5059290 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5059291 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5059292 im going to have liposuction because after four kids i need it
5059293 im also going to have a boob reduction im a gg at the moment and when i take my bra off my nipples are by my feet i want to be a dd instead
5059294 kerry doesnt care about the cost she just wants to look like her old sexy little self more than anything shed love to feel wow about herself
5059295 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5059296 i carried ten wounded people to the hospital in my car
5059297 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5059298 im at that age where biologically it calls me a lot
5059299 i dont want to wait until im in my mid 40s
5059300 a baby is the most important thing in the world to christina right now
5059301 of the invisible god presenting him as a jovial black woman named papa
5059302 i wanted my kids to enjoy a story and through the story to understand their own father better and the god that their father is so in love with
5059303 let me say that once we the trinity knew creation was broken true fathering would be much more lacking than mothering the emphasis on fathering was necessary due to the enormity of its absence
5059304 the olympic games is not a race i ever want to watch on television and think what i could have done in there
5059305 i woke up around and sat around and watched some tv then i had lunch i had some mcdonalds chicken nuggets and then i pretty much went back to my room slept again for like two more hours and went back and got some nuggets
5059306 um it is probably my downfall but i mean i have been doing it so long eating like whatever tastes good so yeah i have been eating mcdonalds almost every meal here i think it has helped out
5059307 i was keeping the pizza for this afternoon but yesterday i was so happy that i had a piece after all
5059308 and it does not seem to have damaged my performance
5059309 worried that the mechanism which hisses as it sprays might ruin the mood
5059310 if you should climb a tree the lion can easily get help from the elephant because the elephant and the lion are friendly t he lion tells the elephant that it wants you down from the tree and the elephant shakes the tree or pulls it up by the roots and down you come
5059311 i wanted it more than anyone else because of athens the french talked a lot before the heat but we showed our worth in the pool
5059312 maybe we can set a new world record at the next maccabiah games
5059313 i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon
5059314 baby i dont know where the fuck the hospital is
5059315 dobson past pecos weve crossed the building hundreds of times
5059316 okay just sit back hold onto the ice pack and stay calm if you panic the venom will probably spread faster
5059317 scorpion sting to the back of my neck what do you think
5059318 i dont know i dont go see anyone i said i was at my peak
5059319 yeah you did alright about how long ago were you stung
5059320 heh funny how fifteen minutes feels like five minutes when youre in a hurry
5059321 yeah hilarious i was a little panicked i have to admit but i feel oh so much better filling out paperwork
5059322 uh huh well its just one page could i see your finger real quick
5059323 yeah what about anti biotics or anti venom its on the back of my neck the spinal column cortex brain those words mean anything to you
5059324 take a seat in there the doctor should be in momentarily just try to stay calm
5059325 watching television sitting on a very uncomfotable chair watching t
5059326 i dont know like two nights ago i woke up and my back area was killing me
5059327 so you went into a private practice urgent care clinic correct
5059328 yeah i took two tonight a vicodin and a demerol at eight and another vicodin and demerol at midnight thats just a few hours ago the pain is coming on strong it just hurts so bad
5059329 that was four pills maam not two ok were going to get you to take some x rays well see whats bothering you keep you for a few hours and if the pain gets worse well see what we can do
5059330 be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth
5059331 there can be no greater issue than that of conservation in this country
5059332 kito memperlakukan boneka lemur tadi seperti teman baiknya ia senang sekali merawatnya memandikan dan kadang berusaha memberi buah untuk dimakan kalo ada ornag baru datang ke rumah ia akan meletakkan si lemur di luar kerangkeng seperti penjaga dan kalau nggak ada orang yang ingin menyakitinya ia akhirnya tenang dan baik2 saja saya sangat terkejut karena kedekatan mereka kito tampak yakin kalo boneka lemur itu asli
5059333 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5059334 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5059335 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5059336 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5059337 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5059338 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5059339 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5059340 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5059341 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5059342 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5059343 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5059344 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5059345 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5059346 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5059347 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5059348 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric
5059349 the truth of the matter is russia is not going to launch nuclear missiles at anybody the poles know that we know it
5059350 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5059351 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5059352 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5059353 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5059354 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5059355 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here

5059367 the triad appears to have prevailed because of old fashion capitalism that values its more centralized location its moving up in stature as a cargo center as the fedex hub nears completion logistics today magazine in its rating of the 50 top logistics friendly cities and metropolitan areas ranked greensboro high point tops in the state and 20th in the southeast last year up from 31st in 2005 it passed charlotte gastonia concord which slipped from 18th in the southeast in 2005 to 22nd raleigh cary came in 28th in the southeast in the latest ranking
5059368 theres so many blokes around these days that look like garry bushell
5059369 so we can look at it now and say there are x number of veterans who are coming back on a regular basis from afghanistan we can look at the figures and say well there arent that many at the moment that are presenting with problems
5059370 but what we can say with some confidence is that over the coming five to 10 years a lot more of those people will have problems
5059371 one of the things that we are dealing with now which weve never really had to deal with much before is people who may have come back from two or three different conflicts
5059372 that produces a whole range of questions about multiple deployments and what sort of impacts they actually have on the people we send over
5059373 what weve got to try to do it set up a situation where when theyve got problems they get in touch and they get help quickly
5059374 and weve got to try and work out what those problems are likely to be
5059375 it was a couple twenties some tens maybe some fives
5059376 i knew i was probably not going to get it so i just decided to go for it i decided to waste it
5059377 the safir ambassador satellite carrier was launched today and for the first time we successfully launched a dummy satellite into orbit
5059378 the president congratulated the iranian nation on the great achievement
5059379 if a tornado were to hit the rv wed all be killed right
5059380 you mark their progress against the tree tops or hold your thumb steady as a mark if there arent any trees
5059381 that can make for some dramatic weather possibly a tornado
5059382 no matter what you are facing you should always have the attitude that you will live through it
5059383 yeah but you didnt let any beat you did you
5059384 n o temos condi es de entrar l a rea est interditada e a per cia ainda n o chegou para saber os danos de fato
5059385 fiquei sem palavras nunca havia perdido algo meu em uma calamidade algo terr vel muito triste estamos todos muito abalados
5059386 voc n o sabe o que fazer um luto estranho e um momento muito dif cil para ver as conseq ncias dessa perda
5059387 a orquestra chegou nesta madrugada t nhamos que dar um jeito
5059388 once again were pleased to get a game behind us and i feel like we got better in the process which i think we did
5059389 i think these upcoming games are going to be really interesting there is really only one team on our mind and thats south korea right now
5059390 we want to be seeded number one in our pool and go from there
5059391 this is why we play we knew this is how it was going to be and thats how the tournament is set up and hopefully through our pool play we have prepared ourselves enough to face our opponents the competition is going to get a lot stronger from this point on its one and done but thats why we play at the level that we played throughout the pool play to get to this point
5059392 i think as a team one through 12 we did a really good job
5059393 we lost focus here and there but overall i know anne was pretty impressed i think as a team were moving forward and were ready to start focusing on our next opponent south korea and getting ready for them
5059394 if only i were more of a swan then i would be happy
5059395 de wereld gaat niet ten onder door een gebrek aan wonderen maar door een gebrek aan verwondering
5059396 de dwaze mens zoekt geluk in de verte de wijze laat het groeien onder zijn voeten
5059397 it the use of chapman and cutler is only done if its better that an outside attorney is involved
5059398 tudo que dito dito de um observador a outro que pode ser ele ou ela mesmo
5059399 i struggled on the back nine i got a little bit stressed after the two bogeys but i started pretty well
5059400 for me it has been difficult to get that second title its been a long wait
5059401 there is a reasonable suspicion to believe the individual is involved in terrorism
5059402 ceci tant fait je d conseille violemment la frequentation de la salle deau pour un temps encore ind termin

5059404 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5059405 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5059406 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5059407 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5059408 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5059409 lenders were saying to me we can see this behaviour and it scares the hell out of us
5059410 they said were getting killed with losses can we figure out more accurately who will do what so we can be more accommodating with some borrowers but not with others
5059411 what if you could live payment free for up to eight months or more and walk away without owing a penny
5059412 you paid your mortgage first to stay in your house paid your auto loan second to get to your job paid your utilities and then your phone bill and other obligations later
5059413 many people with debts now have little experience of living in an environment where they cant just keep borrowing more
5059414 now as they are losing value on their homes they may be less motivated to repay their mortgages instead they will focus on necessities such as eating or paying for heating fuel to pay for those they need to keep their credit cards open credit cards have become an essential item for many people
5059415 montgomery ward started to see bankruptcy losses ahead of much of the market losses were much higher in some parts of the country than others minneapolis saint paul was pristine metropolitan areas in chicago baltimore and los angeles saw much higher bankruptcy rates one of the explanations was for example that this was due to the scandinavian cultural heritage in the twin cities minneapolis saint paul but they were struggling to understand what was happening and why i saw angst then
5059416 i have the impression this is going to be tough
5059417 the value chain in mortgage lending was chopped up and the data collection has become choppy because of it without the data it is hard to really work out what exactly is going on
5059418 id rather switch with you you dont know how hard it is to work from nine to five
5059419 i could be called out to a courtroom at any time
5059420 so i always need to bring a minimum of tools with me
5059421 i usually cant see defendants this close up or look them in the eye
5059422 in the early years i wanted to show off my technique but i didnt have time however i couldnt turn in a badly drawn piece either so i was faced with a dilemma
5059423 its only 15 or 20 minutes it looks simple but its very difficult to adequately capture the scene
5059424 the media usually uses old photos also some especially chubby politicians lose a great deal of weight because of the stress of repeated investigations and months spent in detention
5059425 so i always pay close attention to how i am going to convey the gap between their published images and reality
5059426 this job is something only a few people can experience i am one of the lucky ones
5059427 i understand the importance of reporting high profile cases to the public and i feel the responsibility when i started this job i didnt care about payment i just thought the work was worthwhile i still think so
5059428 we see their work on the tv news every day but their job isnt well known even during the shooting when i mentioned the film was about a courtroom artist no one knew much about the subject
5059429 they are among the few to have witnessed the trials that have influenced the japanese mentality they never judge the cases or the defendants they only observe i felt that was similar to my point of view as a filmmaker
5059430 at first i was very nervous i didnt know my way around the courtroom i hadnt sat in on a trial
5059431 i could hardly call out to the judge to stop the proceedings so i couldnt retrieve it
5059432 honestly i dont have the time as soon as the defendant enters the courtroom i see only the face and concentrate on memorizing everything from facial expressions to clothes and colors
5059433 all my nerves and thoughts are channeled into my sight sometimes i dont even remember the courts decision even if i was sitting right there when the chief judge handed down the sentence
5059434 there were so many trials by the time the last trial rolled around i could draw him matsumoto without actually seeing him from all angles even now i know where his frown lines are
5059435 family members of victims sometimes collapse in tears some leave the room feeling ill
5059436 there are families and friends representing both sides no one feels good the room is oppressive filled with heaviness
5059437 i wish one day you would tell me you have some secret real loving feelings for me instead of just the sex talk all the time i have never let anyone use me like i let you i know i am worth more than just sex yet i always crawl back to you each and every time you are my weakness should i forgive myself for letting someone blatantly take advantage of me
5059438 its ok go be like them its in your heart
5059439 you know they actually pay people grant money to research stuff like that
5059440 i want to give jorge every opportunity to show us this is something he can handle
5059441 there is a more dynamic arm thats not to take away anything from glendons efficiency but right now i think we need to make sure we are creative and proactive looking at this we need to give jorge every opportunity to show us what hes got
5059442 with estimated year end cash of 856 million or 4 10 a share and no debt we believe aeo offers a compelling risk reward profile for long term investors
5059443 this new wind turbine is going to put clean power in places we have never seen before
5059444 when our bus driver refused to go any farther blocked by the throngs of soccer fans outside we alighted and continued our way to volker 3s college my residence by foot
5059445 as we sat there waiting and getting drunk i became more and more enamoured of the handsome volker 3 the club filled up and the dance floor did nothing to cure me i was smug with worldly joy i was in
5059446 the community had been raising red flags for months and sometimes years
5059447 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5059448 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved
5059449 this wasnt any building this was a public spectacle this was a high rise toxic vacant building that was under deconstruction
5059450 the new amd phenom x4 50 series of processors is how phenom should have launched back in november of last year this stepping of phenom doesnt offer higher performance versus the older phenom b1 and b2 steppings but does remove the tlb erratum that caused many consumers to skip over phenom when considering a platform for their next system those that already have an amd socket am2 platform now have a solid upgrade path to look forward to

5059533 jogamos de igual para igual contra a alemanha na primeira fase s temos que tomar cuidado com as bolas a reas que s o perigosas
5059534 considero que o brasil est em uma crescente na competi o contra a noruega pela semifinal tivemos 10 oportunidades de marcar e 20 se transformaram em gols isso para mim um bom aproveitamento temos que manter esse ritmo se quisermos ir final
5059535 n s tivemos aquela velha acomoda o diante da noruega e elas acabaram chegando ao gol por conta disso esse tipo de falha tem acontecido bastante mas contra a alemanha temos de ficar ligadas se dermos essa cochilada contra elas certamente v o se aproveitar e podem complicar nossa vida

5059540 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5059541 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5059542 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship she once said samanthas the father i never had apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5059543 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5059544 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her

5059557 desta vez espero que digam de verdade o presidente russo deve demonstrar que pode cumprir sua palavra ou de outra maneira o povo se perguntar se pode confiar na r ssia

5059618 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here

5059702 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together

5059721 ive got a deep down confidence that i can battle through anything
5059722 i need to have more flamboyant confidence at the start
5059723 obviously ive been the no 1 european player for six years it is interesting that it has taken these major wins to get that across
5059724 theres no doubt ill always make myself available to help anybody else but in that sense winning a couple of majors may make people seek advice from me during that week

5059737 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5059738 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5059739 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5059740 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5059747 any areas that the president wants to feature will benefit from tax advantages to drive opportunities and investment
5059748 mccain seems pretty convinced that nuclear power is the solution to energy concerns

5059754 its going to be placed in nomination in recognition of the 18 million votes that she got her historic candidacy but then she is going to pledge her delegates to sen obama so that its a unanimous a unanimous election that that gives me comfort
5059755 until that had been worked out i was a little uneasy about there being just a roll call without any transference of that support to sen obama but the point is the party is united
5059756 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
5059757 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5059758 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about

5059782 if wed stayed a bit closer we might have had a 20 point game
5059783 overall i was delighted with the way we played weve kept them to the lowest score theyve had all tournament and the lowest margin we stood up we fought and the poise we played with against possibly the best team in the world im just really proud
5059784 were here to learn what the olympics is all about this is a 2012 team maybe a 2016 team really
5059785 theyre the best players in the world but wanted to show that we deserve to be here and that we are capable of playing good basketball
5059786 when you have to go to the depths we did from a physical and a mental point of view and to come out on the positive side it is certainly going to hasten the development of your players
5059787 they know they can go to the well and keep going to well and thats important
5059788 but perhaps because of pressure from us or perhaps because of the anxiety of where the scoreboard was they didnt take them
5059789 we managed to take ours and i think we finished the game reasonably on top
5059790 this is a new team with a lot of new players in it and its very young in its infancy
5059791 weve been under a lot of pressure as a group and weve responded i think magnificently weve had two really top games now after a lot of people were writing us off when a side can get up and do that its always satisfying

5059806 why dont you go see your neighbors go visit one of your friends
5059807 i rounded the corner and looked up in the stands and there were a few people saying no but everyone else most of them were just watching as if they were thinking hey she might make it so i poured it on
5059808 whats the most gut wrenching decision youve ever had to make
5059809 as tough a decision that ive had to make not only because there were political consequences but also because saddam hussein was a bad person and there was no doubt he meant america ill
5059810 went against party loyalty and maybe even against your own best interest for the good of america
5059811 well ill give you an example that in fact i worked with john mccain on
5059812 and that was the issue of campaign ethics reform and finance reform
5059813 my knowledge and my background told me that a few hundred marines in a situation like that could not successfully carry out any kind of peacekeeping mission and i thought they were going into harms way
5059814 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5059815 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5059816 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one
5059817 at the moment of conception i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5059818 pro abortion groups mobilize to defeat dakota pro life initiative
5059819 the people behind this effort want to make south dakota the first step in a long term campaign to mount a legal challenge to roe vs wade
5059820 it seems desperate to me that they would hold a press conference in washington d c
5059821 people in south dakota dont like it if they think someone nationally is trying to tell them what to do

5059828 i am not buying this state of the art vacuum because it is unrealistic that i will use it enough to justify the cost i can spend my money on buying new web designing software so that i can expand my business
5059829 i will not accept a project to maintain a companys website because i will be bored and the quality of the job will suffer i can use the additional time to find work designing new site which i enjoy better
5059830 i will say no to my friends invitation to join his running club because running does not bring out my passion and i do not want to become resentful toward my friend for joining his organization
5059831 there is no such notion anymore in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5059832 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to

5059840 there have been lots of looters the russian soldiers are in a way protecting us but some of the soldiers are good and some of the soldiers are bad

5059847 i swear to the mother of baal you cant make up stuff this bad its like the self congratulation and the self contradiction are competing with each other
5059848 i think we will see a definite shift toward local foods and other ways to stretch the food dollar while still maintaining healthy meals for children
5059849 obviously if we can bring portion sizes down to a more appropriate level it will help tremendously with expenses
5059850 this is a great opportunity for schools to examine healthy portion sizes which not only improve the health of students but cut down on costs as well
5059851 districts will probably need to do more seasonal thinking when it comes to food choices
5059852 while fresh berries might be too expensive in the winter at some schools oranges or grapefruit might not
5059853 when something like this happens when an innocent person becomes victimized like this its definitely a great tragedy
5059854 it mobilized us to take action because such a thing should never ever occur to anyone in any community
5059855 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government
5059856 once they have cleared it we will be presenting it as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5059857 president musharraf says he will not bow to these pressures will not quit and will defend himself
5059858 we want stability in the country we want political stability we want to make progress in the light of the mandate that has been given to our government
5059859 you shouldnt put too much emphasis on preseason scrimmages but
5059860 net als onze landgenoot bolt die een dag eerder de 100 meter bij de mannen won red hebben we geschiedenis geschreven hij met zijn wereldrecord wij met het podium

5059864 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5059865 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5059866 were not selling them we give them free to the people
5059867 we didnt come to cause trouble we just came to bring bibles to help out the chinese christians
5059868 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5059869 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5059870 but i was disappointed by the piazza programme there were too many films which werent made for the big screen and the numbers show that the audience thought the same thing
5059871 we lose up to sfr40 000 36 000 per evening if it doesnt stop raining before five oclock
5059872 she isnt just a glamour star but has something to say and has won an oscar for screenwriting

5059898 when we came in the population asked us to stay to defend them against looters they said the georgian police had run away
5059899 the georgian police are ready to assume its responsibility at any minute
5059900 were not looters we dont need anybody elses stuff we pay for what we take
5059901 ive just noticed over the years that the more kids i have the more flack i get from people who say theyre adamantly pro choice i just find it funny because i guess i would assume that if someone is in favor of supporting womens reproductive rights theyd be a bit more tolerant of a woman who
5059902 shut up now if you keep going youll just be that crazy lady with all the kids at the park instead of what youre trying to show her you are youll just end up a character in an anecdote she tells her friends at parties to show how uneducated and mentally challenged those more than one child women are
5059903 i just cant figure out what people want me to do kill my kids to save the planet or just feel completely torn up with guilt over making them in the first place
5059904 yeah i can see how it might feel that way god im sorry i didnt mean it to sound so harsh i just crap im sorry

5059912 the beetle has a one year life cycle so you wont be able to tell that theres been damage most of the trees that are being attacked right for up to 9 12 months
5059913 sometimes after the tree has been compromised woodpeckers will come in and strip the bark off its then you start to see trees turning yellow and red
5059914 the beetles are carried by the wind but they also fly most of the bug infestations are on the westside in the lodge pole pine populations at high elevations i expect thats where theyre coming from
5059915 a lot is dependent on weather i think a lot of the beetles would prefer to stay up in the high elevation forests where there is a lot of food the unpredictable factor is how quickly they will build up in the city
5059916 its pretty much run its course in the north and central interior sometime over the next five years we expect the beetles will have run out of food theyll either be dispersed into new areas or just die out he says b c experienced a pine beetle infestation in the early 1900s paula findlay of edmonton won the female junior elite matt vierula of ottawa was the male winner photo contributed by contributed story 41197 aug 16 2008 8 29 pm paula findlay of edmonton repeated her 2007 performance by winning the female junior elite category in the 2008 canadian national triathlon championships in the pushor mitchell apple triathlon in kelowna despite temperatures exceeding 35 c on the day paula improved her time of last year in 58 07 matt vierula of ottawa was the male winner and finished the 750m swim 20km cycle and 5km run in 54 53 competition was very strong in the male category with matt sharpe of victoria in second place in 54 57 third place went to cole stewart of langley in 55 08 one of saturdays competitors at the finish line photo rachael kimola apple try a tri results by contributed story 41196 kelowna and westbank first time triathletes competed in the pushor mitchell kelowna apple triathlon saturday completing the try a tri 300 m swim 15 km bike 3 km run in good spirit and sunny weather results were females 1st 49 33 laura ransom kelowna 2nd 50 03 jodi walsh westbank 3rd 53 28 anna page lumby males 1st 50 04 jared verstaete kelowna 2nd 50 08 aaron wells westbank 3rd 50 54 jim faulkner enderby the kids of steel showed determination and endurance in the 500 m swim 15 km bike and 4 km run in the age group 8 9 years desirae ridenour of cowichan finished first in 21 58 with jordan hopkins of victoria winning the boys 8 9 in 23 13 age group 10 11 was won by cordell dickie of kelowna in 31 30 and courtney chanin of queen charlotte winning the girls in 33 42 spencer burns of powell river 44 40 was the winner in the boys 12 13 section and robynne shannon of vancouver in the girls in 44 44 winner for boys 14 15 was riley maccharles in 47 00 and gabrielle edwards of saskatoon in girls 52 21 the 16 19 age group race of 750 m swim 20 km bike and a 5 km run was won by fraser cashion of port coquitlam in 1 03 39 and allegra rogers of westbank was first female in with 1 11 35 results of the junior elite races will be made available soon with temperatures of mid 30s expected sunday the age group sprint elite and olympic distance races are expected to be very tough by rcmp story 41195 aug 16 2008 7 20 pm rcmp are looking for a suspect after a early morning rape in kelownas downtown core police say that a lone female was walking near the 1400 block of richter street at approximately 2 00 am saturday she was approached by an unknown male and after a brief conversation was attacked and assaulted the male suspect is described as follows caucasian male approx age between 21 25 years of age approx height 5 6

5059919 it was one of those nights when i wore a supertight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car on the way home i said to my husband len wiseman darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in at home i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through it appears i survived unscathed

5059987 in addition to the expertise of our senior partners experience on demand provides a team of 24 associate partners specializing in key aspects of management and professional business services
5059988 our firms business model is rooted in research conducted at the university of missouri st louis college of business administration which reveals there is a talent gap at many organizations between entry level managers and experienced executives leaving their jobs resulting in a vacuum of capable management expertise
5059989 we established experience on demand to fill those professional gaps on an interim basis at small and large companies anticipating change or dealing with new challenges but which lack the crucial executive talent to address the specific issues that they confront
5059990 experience on demand is a unique management consulting consortium our senior partners and associates provide dedicated high level professional skills and proven expertise on a part time basis to help organizations manage special projects address workload peaks plan for strategic change and apply objective business management insight on an as needed basis
5059991 each organization we serve seeks professional expertise on a focused transitional basis to help the organization address challenging internal or external goals in each case one or more of our partners may be on assignment for several days or several weeks per month until the project goals are met
