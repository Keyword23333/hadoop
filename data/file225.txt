2250009 the clearest set of numbers however may not be found in any version of the state budget but rather in the actual cash reports published by the state controllers office they tell us whats coming into the state treasury from various taxes and other revenue sources and where its being spent

2250078 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude people ask why is there poverty in the world its a silly question poverty is the default human condition the interesting question isnt why is there poverty its why is there wealth or why is there prosperity here but not there at the end of the day the first answer is capitalism rightly understood that is to say free markets private property the spirit of entrepreneurialism and the conviction that the fruits of your labors are your own in large measure our wealth isnt the product of capitalism it is capitalism and yet we hate it leaving religion out of it no idea has given more to humanity the average working class person today is richer in real terms than the average prince or potentate of 300 years ago his food is better his life longer his health better his menu of entertainments vastly more diverse his toilette infinitely more civilized and yet we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual meanwhile billions have ridden capitalism out of poverty and yet the children of capitalism still whine

2250220 i think it is undermining our civil liberties and at the moment at least there is no reasonable grounds to be doing that
2250221 we believe the overwhelming majority of the protesters are law abiding people there for a legitimate reason
2250222 but we believe there is a small hard core of people who are prepared to use criminal tactics and criminal activity to get their point across
2250223 omg just caught up on youtube h cannot die it would be the end of csi miami are we sure he is leaving the show i sure hope not cuz horatio is csi miami without him the show would just lose all interest i love you david
2250224 youre sentenced to be a slut for the rest of your life
2250225 this was stupid megan this was even stupider if you got caught
2250226 the most that they did was have them re enact situations that already happened for filming purposes errors in the tape sound etc

2250232 i have no idea if this is going to work
2250233 how did you do it how do you know how kids talk
2250234 you americans talk about people with multiple personalities but its really people with multiple souls
2250235 because when a man dies the personality dies with him but the soul goes on
2250236 holy shit this isnt an actor this is this character
2250237 i think this is going to be creatively really healthy to just go meet new people
2250238 maybe not that one maybe you should leave that one alone
2250239 im sorry wed like one more and we dont know how to do it and make it original we know weve kind of ignored you so why dont you come and do it

2250242 yay were going to grandmas house to take a bath
2250243 since theyve come to seattle this is really the first incident and certainly the first fatality connected to pedicabs
2250244 were as interested in getting to the bottom of this situation as anyone
2250245 on a regular bike stopping power down a hill can be pretty hard sometimes but going down a grade that steep is just retarded
2250246 why would a pedicab be coming down cedar a dinky bike with 3 adults on it
2250247 when going down cedar on our mountain bikes well sometimes walk it because of traffic and the hill that seems messed up especially when the pedicab driver is responsible for the passengers as well
2250248 this is the first time ive ever heard of a pedicab fatality
2250249 our frustration is that we see plenty of prime time tv shows depicting marijuana use in a humorous light yet when we produce a half hour program designed to take a serious look at our marijuana laws and their impact on our communities we cant get any airtime
2250250 we dont use our public airways to promote illegal things
2250251 pretty fairly given that its done by a group that has an objective
2250252 we dont want to send the wrong message to kids that might be impressionable
2250253 i have a colleague who is back in the uk now and could be sent tix cheaply and quickly who will leave the uk later i have one but dont want to go on my own so need at least one other preferably 2 if you have please let me know soon as so can arrange many thanks or if anyone involved in rowing needs a translator those 2 days i could provide translation in exchange for access mobile 86 138 1789 8642 gmt 7 hrs
2250254 there was a simplicity about it that we would fight the brits and force them down belfast lough and out
2250255 our whole philosophy within the prison was to bring about a 32 county democratic socialist republic
2250256 and thats mainly my objection now and my concerns with the republican movement that it is developing into a purely middle class movement that it has dropped the 32 county democratic socialist republican principles
2250257 i remember sitting in a hotel room with a bunch of these guys and they were all pretty well off
2250258 there was a briefcase with the money in it on the table and they were banging the table this guy what did he call himself the oc of the irish american republican army was banging the table demanding that i shoot the queen that we shoot postmen that we shoot anyone with the crown on their caps
2250259 nobody works harder in this movement than gerry and i have great admiration for him in that regards and hes my friend my comrade
2250260 making a living out of politics here now and people who are in a position of power and influence and it becomes enjoyable but a lot of people are left behind a lot of the ordinary working republicans are left behind
2250261 the leadership has to allow itself to be open to criticism
2250262 i have a colleague who is back in the uk now and could be sent tix cheaply and quickly who will leave the uk on 7th august i have one but dont want to go on my own so need at least one other preferably 2 if you have please let me know soon as so can arrange many thanks

2250266 is to have big chunks of time during the day when all youre doing is thinking
2250267 were all on the same journey you can choose to do it with joy
2250268 youre going to walk it anyway so you may as well enjoy it

2250288 that based on the evidence we had collected we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt

2250295 the state funding has not been cut requests for services has overwhelmed our ability to hand it this year its just with the economy weve been overwhelmed with people coming in who wouldnt have otherwise

2250299 the difference that i see in felix now is tonight he clearly didnt have his best stuff and hes still into the eighth inning
2250300 he didnt try to strike everybody out he was pitching to contact for sure
2250301 i think the key there was the first three innings
2250302 a guy that your team and the other team knows that they really have their work cut out for them that day
2250303 and as an opposing club you come in and know you may have to alter your game plan in a big way
2250304 to be able to go out there without having his best stuff and dominate for eight innings i think it shows you his maturity that hes growing as a pitcher
2250305 hes very much upbeat hes feeling like the organization has got to find out about some other people

2250325 after four years of painstaking scientific research the f b i by 2005 had traced the anthrax in the poisoned letters of 2001 to a single flask of the bacteria at the army biodefense laboratory at fort detrick md according to government scientists and bureau officials
2250326 but at least 10 scientists had regular access to the laboratory and its anthrax stock and counting visitors from other institutions and workers at laboratories in ohio and new mexico that had received anthrax samples from the flask at the army laboratory
2250327 having received a sample or obtained it surreptitiously they would be
2250328 by 2005 genetic research had tied the anthrax to a supply in dr ivinss laboratory but officials indicated that it took nearly four years to eliminate others who had access to the same supply

2250396 i pretty much got here on my own my mom a little bit but being on my own is not a big adjustment at all
2250397 you have to keep focused coaches will be on you if you mess up but theres nothing that surprises me
2250398 id look at it when a coach would say to look at it but during the spring i started really getting into it and now i think im really starting to know what im doing
2250399 coach baggett gets on me and i like that about him
2250400 at first i was too shaky for that but now i know where hes coming from and dandre goodwin i thought the older guys wouldnt tell us anything because they didnt want us to take their spots but everybody helps everybody so thats great

2250406 i kept a read zone ran around the outside i went to turn up and i just couldnt do what i normally did
2250407 everyones body responds a little bit differently and his body response sill be different from another guys one thing i think and believe is hes a pretty quick healer
2250408 we all trust those guys theyll do whats best for me to get back as fast as possible without risking injury again
2250409 weve talked about a two quarterback system and we knew this would be coming not quite in this form but we knew we wanted to develop ronnie so this is a blessing in a sense and also allows us to give locker a little bit of rest

2250435 from what im hearing all of british columbia is seeing a peak this year in sightings and complaints
2250436 theres no great benefit for them at all theyre confronted by dangers in traffic and that sort of thing theyre attracted by easy food
2250437 when i was in high school i didnt take care of myself financially but school wise and being motivated i always made my own decisions
2250438 i pretty much got here on my own my mom a little bit but being on my own is not a big adjustment at all
2250439 you have to keep focused coaches will be on you if you mess up but theres nothing that surprises me
2250440 id look at it when a coach would say to look at it but during the spring i started really getting into it and now i think im really starting to know what im doing
2250441 coach baggett gets on me and i like that about him
2250442 at first i was too shaky for that but now i know where hes coming from and dandre goodwin i thought the older guys wouldnt tell us anything because they didnt want us to take their spots but everybody helps everybody so thats great
2250443 both of those kids you couldnt ask for better leaders especially having all the young kids in the backfield they lead by example and they know where everyones supposed to be every play and theyre both just a real pleasure to coach
2250444 but you never forget something like that its always going to stay in that special place in your stomach where you can bring it out when you need to
2250445 but when the times get tough and you get tired or its third and 3 you just remember that feeling of man lets get this done or lets get this first down and it gets real serious
2250446 i think every player has something that drives them to be the best they can be
2250447 hes going to get a real chance in the preseason to play a lot
2250448 he knows that so now he has to show i think hes fine i think hes improving his decision making is faster which had to happen and that comes with understanding what we do
2250449 and selfishly id like him to take the next step and then it frees me up to use seneca in other ways
2250450 hes a very smart guy and he wants to be a good player
2250451 but the system takes awhile to learn trent dilfer had a tough time with it matt had a little bit of a tough time with it but frye can definitely throw so well go from there
2250452 he really helped me get through the tough time when i first got here with the situation he was in when he first came to seattle everything happens for a reason and maybe i was just supposed to be out here
2250453 hell get his chance again im sure and when he does hell be more prepared to be successful just because hes older wiser stronger all those things
2250454 hes doing all the right stuff and guys really like him
2250455 its kind of different to not be dealing with family and ticket requests and everything that goes along with playing at home
2250456 out here you can just play football and its really kind of nice
2250457 i am covered by the blood of jesus i will come home
2250458 we admired him and because of him none of us will ever be the same
2250459 which is why he was on the front lines on saturday july 26th
2250460 id like to see this case go to trial as scheduled on dec 1
2250461 the work that he has to do needs to be done
2250462 and im not sure it will be done in time
2250463 no not that hell just be different he wont be this
2250464 yes as headstrong and stubborn and sometimes mean as three is we are loving three well these days three and a half
2250465 beibei is known to be gentle and pure strong in water sports she reflects the blue olympic ring
2250466 jingjing is charmingly na ve and optimistic he is an athlete noted for strength who represents the black olympic ring

2250468 strong in track and field events yingying is a quick witted and agile boy who represents the yellow olympic ring
2250469 nini is as innocent and joyful as a swallow she is strong in gymnastics and represents the green olympic ring
2250470 he had a soul that is often missing in the business which has taken on much more of a corporate tone
2250471 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2250472 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2250473 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2250474 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it

2250513 children forced to beg in the streets are vulnerable and represent an easy target for traffickers of human beings young girls and boys begging in the streets can easily end up being trafficked outside kosovo as well
2250514 the general public feeds the phenomenon by giving coins to children making their exploitation by adults profitable and indirectly supporting trafficking in human beings

2250532 developing confidence in an international security architecture without a nuclear umbrella
2250533 it is our responsibility to make the commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and to do the hard work to make this vision a reality

2250618 new york city has long been the highest tax jurisdiction in the united states but california politicians are proposing to steal that brass tiara
2250619 the plan would raise the top marginal income tax rate to 12 from 10
2250620 this latest tax gambit was unveiled ironically enough within days of two very large california employers announcing they are saying in the famous words of governor arnold schwarzenegger
2250621 then last week toyota announced it is canceling plans to build its new prius hybrid at its plant in the san francisco bay area because of the high tax and regulatory costs adding to the humiliation is that toyota will now take this investment and about 1 000 jobs to a more progressive and pro business state mississippi
2250622 for over 50 years california has been pumping water through the sacramento san joaquin delta for extensive urban and agricultural uses around the state today the delta is ailing and in urgent need of a new management strategy this report concludes that building a peripheral canal to carry water around the delta is the most promising way to balance two critical policy goals reviving a threatened ecosystem and ensuring a reliable high quality water supply for california
2250623 with the courts severely restricting water exports from the delta because of declining fish populations there has been renewed interest in a peripheral canal although that term is largely banned from official discourse but fierce opposition persists mostly from delta farmers concerned that a canal would isolate them from public money to fix their deteriorating levees although they rarely admit to that motive and from environmental groups that want to use restricted water supply as a tool to curb development in southern california although they are equally reluctant to admit that
2250624 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2250625 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2250626 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2250627 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2250628 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2250629 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2250630 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2250631 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2250646 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
2250647 love to all my conservative soldiers out there and the troops overseas
2250648 it seems justin and i always end up back with each other i do date other people and go out and have fun but it is really hard for other guys to accept how my life is and my crazy schedule before even considering marriage we would actually have to be together exclusively for awhile lol

2250658 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2250659 there are a lot of blind shots on it a lot of questions on what line to hit it and a lot of holes you dont hit a full driver on i think this is definitely a course it would have helped to have a practice round on
2250660 today was more of a struggle im really happy to shoot 74 today the putting was very tricky it felt like a lot of work today
2250661 the course is tough and the greens are extremely tough if you dont putt well its hard to score here
2250662 and if you dont eliminate the three or four putts its going to be a struggle
2250663 i placed it off the tee fairly well until the last couple holes
2250664 and i had 29 putts for 18 holes thats pretty good for me i had some three putts but i also had some one putts where i got up and down
2250665 the state am the kentucky open ive been really working on my game

2250667 that the esv was selected by chinese christian leaders for publication with chinese cuv bible through our partnership with the british and foreign bible society since both the cuv and the esv are essentially literal bible translations they are ideally suited for a side by side comparison of the two languages what a wonderful thing it would be if thousands of people would learn english and chinese by reading the bible in side by side bilingual editions
2250668 it is a great joy for all of us at crossway bibles to have a small part in providing gods word to the church in china through the publication of the cuv esv bilingual bible
2250669 we pray that this is just the beginning of building partnerships with the church in china for the publication of bible resources that will help meet the needs of the chinese people
2250670 i liked her much better in the bob i thought it was really sophisticated very chic and very trendy
2250671 this whole sort of fashion evolution since becoming mrs tom cruise i think it has taken her time to find her sea legs

2250673 this is a budget in which state government and all of its organizations must prove that they can be better stewards of the taxpayers hard earned money
2250674 you have got to spend dollars and time and effort to get the payoff
2250675 when the economy is tight we need to pay more attention to job recruitment efforts the people of kentucky expect the governor to aggressively recruit investments that result in jobs
2250676 bus tickets can cost 25 or more and taxi fare can be hundreds of dollars for a single trip according to a travel advisory
2250677 having the governor lead these discussions shows just how serious kentucky is about bringing business to the state
2250678 the japanese presence in kentucky is of major importance and major significance

2250690 from what his mother told me he went hiking on a particular route
2250691 hes been hiking before there was no evidence of stress or strange behaviour there was no family row
2250692 i think his whole life is teaching he does extra curricular work outside school hours for the school and spends his time at hyde united or watching sport
2250693 i dont want to speculate but i know of no reason why he would disappear so you are fearful theres been an accident
2250694 if thats the case you would have a rough idea where hes been walking it shouldnt be that difficult to find him but they havent
2250695 we are looking at the appeal process but we are not entirely comfortable with that at the moment so we are negotiating
2250696 ultimately our members will decide if they want to take industrial action to try to correct some of the wrongs
2250697 we as an employer are obliged to review all of our staffs pay in relation to one another and we have to implement that with due consideration to equal pay for work of equal value
2250698 that has meant that some staff have gone up and some staff unfortunately have gone down
2250699 these are good staff that provide a very very good service to the people of bury and they have been very loyal to this council and the locality and my heart does go out to them

2250717 after weeks of late night negotiations and under intense u s pressure iraqi lawmakers failed to pass a much debated provincial elections law wednesday before adjourning for the month the failure to pass the law which would govern elections in provinces across the country may push the elections into next year if elections dont happen by the end of this year it could be july before the balloting could be carried out u n spokesman said arikat said

2250719 days of intense negotiations and heavy pressure from the u s the united nations and britain
2250720 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a local elections law
2250721 its interesting what i find interesting about this report as well is when youre looking at these two countries iraq and afghanistan seeing how vastly different iraq is from afghanistan in terms of the natural resources that they have afghanistan is a very poor country one of the poorest in the world iraq will come back much faster given that they had some semblance of infrastructure as crumbling as it was but something to work from afghanistan is being built from scratch and so i thought that was something worth taking away
2250722 i saw the report i saw the reports about the report so id refer you back to the state department just to as they wake up this moring just to make sure that theyve looked at it because i dont know all the details
2250723 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
2250724 weve done a lot for the iraqis just in terms of the numbers themselves
2250725 ill tell you what concerns me and most of my constituents you said many times the gains in iraq are fragile and reversable so my constituents and i believe that
2250726 you have to wonder why the best that you can say is that the gains are fragile and reversable
2250727 and i listened carefully to senator hagel and ambassador crocker from the answer you gave him i dont get the
2250728 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
2250729 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
2250730 iraqs oil income will more than double this year baghdad continues to spend only a small percentage of its own money on reconstruction and services while it banks billions in surplus funds
2250731 between 2005 and 2007 only 10 percent of iraqs expenditures went toward reconstruction with just 1 percent spent on maintaining u s and iraqi funded investments in roads water electricity and weapons according to a report released yesterday by the government accountability office even when baghdad has allocated larger sums the report said it has spent only a small portion of the budgeted money
2250732 left little doubt that iraq which racked up 32 9 billion in oil earnings from january through june can afford to pay more for its own reconstruction
2250733 driving through iraq you feel the neglect here in basra the city is rivers of sewage destroyed buildings and bridges from war after war after war every day i pass by the same buildings destroyed years ago during the u s led invasion in my neighborhood in baghdad every day they look exactly the same a pile of rubble the electricity problem seems to be getting worse iraqis have an average of about four hours of electricity a day while there is talk of reconstruction a bridge here flowers planted there the people dont feel a change
2250734 one thing thats very important is how they are spending their money which is distributing it evenly amongst the around the country but amongst the different sects as well so shias sunnis and kurds its something that theyre going to have to continue to work out we want them to take on more of their own responsibilities just from a security standpoint but also reconstruction also if you remember prime minister maliki went into sadr city basra and mosul he offered immediate financial assistance to people who were living there under those terrible conditions
2250735 it is good for their psychological health it is good to take care of the appearance to see the building a new clean
2250736 school kits to iraqi refugee children distribution of uniforms shoes and school materials and is expected to outfit 30 000 children from damascus and rural damascus before the start of the syrian school year on sept 7 last year unhcrs distribution reached 20 000 iraqi children
2250737 its really important that they figure out a way to quickly get that money to those people directly i think theyve made a lot of progress on that but they needed to do more
2250738 notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of armored security vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 206 milliion

2250740 the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of m1a1 and upgrade to m1a1m abrams tanks as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 2 16 billion

2250751 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2250752 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2250753 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
2250754 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
2250755 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
2250756 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
2250757 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them

2250771 i care a lot for you because you are my closest friend and i hate to see you feeling so miserable
2250772 you are such a farking liar cut out the farking lies
2250773 if we knew what god had in mind for us we would have probably fainted from shock and not have the strength to carry on with our life
2250774 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life

2250876 the chances of key local polls taking place in iraq this year all but vanished yesterday after parliament failed to pass a law on elections because of a row over the contested city of kirkuk which threatens to heighten arab kurdish tensions
2250877 the iraqi parliament speaker ended an emergency parliamentary session wednesday after the political blocs failed to reach an agreement over a disputed provincial election bill parliament speaker mahmoud al mashhadani said by the end of the 44th session on wednesday the parliament concluded its first legislative term and would resume sessions on sept 9
2250878 roughly half of the 48 billion dollar budget of 2008 approved earlier by the parliament
2250879 i can confirm to you that we have lost the chance to hold the elections in october
2250880 iraqi politicians officials and western diplomats have speculated that the political parties in government were never invested in holding a vote this year out of fear they would lose seats and influence at the provincial level senior politicians including president jalal talabani a kurd and vice president tariq hashimi a sunni arab have been absent from baghdad during the round the clock negotiations citing medical reasons
2250881 the elections would be the first provincial balloting in almost four years
2250882 i listened to many of them i noticed that most of them talk about kirkuk in a way as if its a prey for the greed and abmitions of their parties they never talk about it as a part of iraq because they dont care about iraq they care only about their limited personal interests
2250883 special inspector general for iraq reconstructions recent findings about how rich iraq is with oil money
2250884 yes its true that the iraqi government is spending little on reconstruction the weak iraqi capability to do big projects maybe at the end of 2008 will improve
2250885 signs of iraqs slowness to rebuild are everywhere in baghdad roughly 20 of the city is without proper sewage pipes published statistics say the baghdad is getting roughly 11 hours of electricity a day on average but many residents go days with only sporadic bursts of power iraqi officials say fixing just this problem could take up to 10 years chronic electricity shortages for another decade mean little energy for construction making iraqi hopes for a renewed capital seem distant
2250886 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2250887 this is projected and not real money we have many reconstruction projects and as you know most of the infrastruture of the country had collapsed after the war and that needs a lot of money to rebuild the country
2250888 as of december 31 2007 the iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of 29 4 billion held in the development fund for iraq and central government deposits at the central bank of iraq and iraqs commerical banks
2250889 from 2005 through 2007 the iraqi government generated an estimated 96 billion in cumulative revenues of which crude oil export sales accounted for about 90
2250890 with oil prices at or near all time highs it has become increasingly apparent that iraq is closer than ever to financial independence with the extreme property damage caused by an invasion of questionable legality the need for security and reconstruction monies is great but who should be held accountable many us taxpayers are becoming disenchanted due to the fact that with nearly 33 billion in oil earnings in the first half of 2008 iraq is now capable of shouldering an increased share of the burden our own economy is floundering and many simply feel that it is time for iraq to step up and assume control over its own destiny
2250891 two numbers 482 billion and 79 billion the first is next years projected federal budget deficit a record the second is the budget surplus that iraq is expected to accumulate by the end of the year is there any question which government whose taxpayers should be footing the bill for reconstruction projects in iraq
2250892 something is out of whack iraqis are very proud to say that its their country and they are right so they should fix it
2250893 many iraqis who lack adequate electricity clean water and jobs find it unfathomable their country is awash in oil dollars last year it spent less than a third of the 12 billion budgeted for major projects such as electricity housing and water
2250894 five star hotels parking garages a theater restaurant aquarium and basketball courts casino and boat rides but given the lagging basic services reporters questioned whether baghdads priorities are appropriate and realistic with temperatures hittign 130 degrees many parts of iraq dont have a steady electricity supply and some areas only get two hours a day getting clean water and adequate health care are also major issues

2250898 were those voters in the 19th century who spun off from the whigs and the democrats and didnt try to spin the difference between these two parties on slavery waste their vote
2250899 ive done surveys and polls all over the country heres my conclusion 15 of the republicans will vote for the republican nominee if the republican nominee was leon trotsky and 15 of the democrats would vote for the democratic nominee if the nominee was ayn rand

2250950 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen mccain
2250951 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2250952 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2250953 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2250954 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2250955 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2250956 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2250957 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2250958 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that

2250963 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2250964 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2250965 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2250966 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2250967 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2250968 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam

2250987 while theres no doubt has served his country with honor the agenda hes supported over the last eight years has not served the nation as well
2250988 i dont think its about its about making obama different foreign other
2250989 these people are running a bad version of the last campaign 2008 is not 2004
2250990 i said at that time i would much rather lose a political campaign than lose a war took a different path

2250997 very strong measures will be taken shortly to deal with such kinds of unauthorized activities and some key elements will be detained soon
2250998 though in the past those people involved in the so called tibetan independence activities were arrested and freed immediately but this time professional demonstrators and backbones are to be detained and kept in the cell for a much longer time depending on their nature of activities
2250999 once they are detained their identity will be checked and strong measures will be taken accordingly those who do not have proper identity documents will be sent back to where they came from

2251040 how to get in lean shape with little or no equipment zen habits
2251041 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2251042 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2251043 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2251044 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2251045 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years
2251046 and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2251047 the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2251048 i am disappointed and angry thousands of friends and supporters of put their faith and confidence in him and he has let them down
2251049 young supporters who put their time and energy into his campaign with a newfound energy and idealism for politics have been betrayed by his actions but the issues we cared about and fought for poverty worker justice clean environment and health care for all are issues worth continuing to fight
2251050 people are human and they make mistakes i feel bad for his family and i feel bad for him im sure this is one of those times when being human catches up with you
2251051 anybody looking at this its going to be difficult for john in the future politically
2251052 he was running for president whats he supposed to do admit it
2251053 you can say that for the first time in his life mudcat refused to comment
2251054 my thoughts and prayers are with the sen barack obama d ill the presumptive democratic nominee declined to comment on the revelation
2251055 i assume he wont come to the convention and i assume he wont ask to speak
2251056 if hes going to have any public role at all hes going to have to convince people that hes genuinely sorry not only about what he did but about the lying
2251057 obviously unless he heals his family he can never heal his career
2251058 but supposing he does that yes he can come back divorce was once a career ender then newt gingrich about his infidelity nor my old boss maybe folks are starting to practice what they preach about letting he who is without sin cast the first stone
2251059 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2251060 it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2251061 under assumed names in a series of expensive homes in north carolina and more recently in santa barbara california
2251062 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2251063 i will try to serve you with dignity and honesty just like we ran this campaign
2251064 i knew the time was right and i felt i was the right person to do it

2251071 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2251072 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2251073 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2251074 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2251075 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company

2251077 north south operation is very unpredictable along the east coast i dont think this is a place where we should skimp on fuel

2251079 because in an attempt to abide by the new fuel conservation procedures just adopted by the company not enough fuel was put on the aircraft to handle a simple delay in an effort to save money an aircraft had to divert the aircraft arrived at its destination two hours late finally the pilots had to get off their trip early because of fatigue and because they would have flown nine hours and 40 minutes if they had continued on

2251086 it has been a long and winding road but today we celebrate that congress heard the voices of millions of patients and physicians and voted to override president bushs veto and protect the health of america we thank the bipartisan majority in congress who voted to put patients first
2251087 the 10 6 percent cut in payments to physicians who treat medicare patients would have been devastating to seniors and the disabled who rely on medicare for the health care they need
2251088 this congressional debate underscores the need for lawmakers to permanently replace the flawed medicare physician payment formula so physicians can focus on the real work at hand taking care of patients
2251089 we are encouraged that this bill stops medicare cuts for the next 18 months and gives physicians a 1

2251418 for our launch issue our theme will be the politics of race where we discuss among other things models of governance besides the power sharing model how race politics affects us socio economically how the re introduction of local elections can help reduce ethnic salience a historical context on race and ethnic relations in malaysia and so on
2251419 these will be longer articles something i suppose you could liken to a thematic monthly magazine or meatspace journal and is very unlike a news site like malaysiakini or news commentary and analysis site like malaysian insider and also unlike the nut graph which will be focused on politics and pop culture
2251420 we will be hiring more writers soon but most of our articles will be in the form of contributions either by academics industry experts or freelancers
2251421 there are some great writers and thinkers out there but more often than not they either do not have a platform to publish these views or do not have a community to furnish these ideas and thoughts to we aim to create a space for these views
2251422 our goal is to provide intelligent well thought out articles for the purpose of discussion and dissemination so that all malaysians may engage in the theme and the issues being debated and discussed each month towards possible solutions to these issues
2251423 personally i think malaysia is ready for this we are at a place now where there is a potential for debate and discussion that is rational and unemotional
2251424 i got involved with this project because i believe in its potential to help us discuss and debate very real and important issues that are affecting us on every possible level
2251425 malaysians are starved for well thought out opinions on the issues of the day and its a good time to offer them something longer more structured in terms of content and to get them to move discussion and debate in the direction of solutions and growth

2251432 it could also say that australians are exposed to the international credit crunch not because banks are up to their gills in dodgy mortgages as in the us and europe but because we have a huge current account deficit and that we want to address that through better productivity skills and other reforms including tax reform

2251461 le t l film de battlestar galactica sera r alis par adama
2251462 im going to try to be as brief as possible today it is a very broad subject that ill be talking about today but i felt that this topic needed to be covered because of an email i received and im not going to read the email but i felt that it needed to be addressed
2251463 its about paganism its a very controversial subject its usually only controversial to those who dont know much about it
2251464 just so you know the email went in the trash the same place every other thing that stinks goes
2251465 paganism as i said is very misunderstood its very controversial and thats what i want to address today i want to perhaps demystify paganism and maybe remove some of the stigma behind it
2251466 so i ask you what is paganism is is devil worship is it people who go around casting spells on their enemies is it people in black robes who go around harming small animals and mutilating cattle
2251467 just so you know if you believe any of that then three things become extremely obvious right off the top
2251468 not all but many pagans see animals as an extension of the divinity of mother earth mother earth being the embodiment of the divine
2251469 and by the way you people who spread these lies this
2251470 third pagans do not go out looking for people to hurt
2251471 the majority of pagans recite the same creed if it harms no one to what you wish
2251472 that being said those are the main three stigma that i would like to eliminate cause as i said
2251473 when some of you hear the word pagan you automatically think wicca
2251474 mormonism even can be considered pagan because theyre a polytheistic religion they believe in multiple deities but
2251475 as i said most pagans are polytheistic but not all are
2251476 some of you think that pagans come from only one type of background that also is untrue pagans come from everywhere they come from
2251477 youve been taught to believe that pagans walk around wearing all black or hooded robes chanting incantations well if you ask me that sounds an awful lot like a catholic priest or maybe a buddhist monk
2251478 some of you have known pagans for years and you never knew who they were why consider your attitude toward religion maybe theyre afraid of you maybe theyre more afraid of you than you are of them consider your attitude
2251479 secondly they dont shove it down your throat one of the most basic tenants of paganism is that they
2251480 if you ask them about it theyll be completely honest
2251481 mathew 10 14 jeshua says and who so ever shall not receive you nor hear your words when you depart out of that house or city shake the dust off of your feet
2251482 if you try to force someone into your belief if you try to force someone to believe the way you do or accept what youre saying
2251483 most people who are condemning pagans dont realize how much they have in common with them you dont think so every time you celebrate christmas you celebrate a pagan holiday
2251484 christmas is on december 25 th jeshua wasnt born in december jeshua was born some time in late august mid september nobody really knows the exact date but
2251485 there was a roman emperor who set the date to december 25
2251486 mithras one of those pagan deities mithras birthday was on december 25
2251487 oh but its what you mean by it that matters right the star on the top of the christmas tree thats the star of well maybe youre right it
2251488 what about the rituals that they perform yes they perform rituals and spells a ritual is nothing more than the performance of a visual prayer an enacted prayer to give the practitioner something to focus on it gives the practitioner a
2251489 and by the way those pagans that do fit the stereotypes tend to grow out of it by puberty
2251490 paganism is more a way of life than it is a religion because you can be any number of
2251491 and by the way i think i should say this as well
2251492 im not going to give you a lecture on satanism right now but i think that you pagans out there who use that line oh not satanists
2251493 and another thing you pagans out there are guilty a lot of you of the same thing you accuse the christians of you
2251494 maybe you need to get out there and shed some light on the subject
2251495 as i said before if you understand something it brings unity it brings peace if you havent seen the sermon on dogma look it up its titled
2251496 thats my sermon i hope once again that something ive said has helped you if you have any questions please feel free to email me at i look forward to hearing your questions and your comments thank you for your time

2251916 es ist schon ein mulmiges gef hl hier zu arbeiten und zu wissen dass hier mehr als 1000 menschen auf brutale weise ums leben gekommen sind
2251917 die angehende geografi estudentin hatte im vergangenen jahr an zwei workcamps in ihrem heimatland teilgenommen die ihr sehr gefallen hatten
2251918 according to the witnesses we have interviewed there is a significant possibility that he died from what we call friendly fire shots from the gun of an fbi agent

2251921 in light of these allegations we will be seeking to make contact with the landlord this may well constitute unfair trading procedures and this is something the council would look into
2251922 that should not be the case and it wont be the case as far as im aware there is no change in price there is no difference everyone should be paying the same

2251925 this concerns us even though we received claims of premature deterioration on just a small portion of this product
2251926 the deterioration that you would be looking for may be visible cracking on the surface of the products or it could be flaking on the surface of the product that looks out of the ordinary
2251927 remedy the problem up to the replacement of the entire deck if needed
2251928 they are well and we will be taking them to bosasso
2251929 miguel is a veteran guy who has had a lot of success in the bullpen
2251930 he probably had more success in the bullpen than starting and with brandon morrow gone miguel gives us another veteran arm to get to closer j j putz thats something else that figured into our decision
2251931 tacoma pitching coach dwight bernard says ryan has been throwing the ball well giving up two runs in each of his starts but still fighting a little bit on his fastball command
2251932 and thats one thing he needed work on when he went down but hes progressing
2251933 i dont think he is very happy about it which is a natural thing
2251934 this is not something we wanted to do but he is making mistakes in crucial situations and were sending him to the bullpen to get more work it seems like there is more work down there than there is as a starter
2251935 even if you are going to get hit you have to be more aggressive with your pitches
2251936 he is averaging two baserunners an inning and thats a difficult thing to do and be successful if you are giving up a lot of hits you have to keep your walks down and he hasnt been able to do that
2251937 hopefully we can use him a few times out there and he can get better than what he has been
2251938 the hard part is convincing him that hes as important to the staff pitching out in the bullpen as he would be as a starter
2251939 old men declare war but it is the youth that must fight and die
2251940 economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement
2251941 prosperity cannot be restored by raids upon the public treasury
2251942 when there is a lack of honor in government the morals of the whole people are poisoned
2251943 peace is not made at the council table or by treaties but in the hearts of men
2251944 it is the youth who must inherit the tribulation the sorrow that are the aftermath of war
2251945 it is just as important that business keep out of government as that government keep out of business
2251946 in the end the pogos appeal lies in its mobility and its near instantaneous picture production teens and tweens in particular will love this feature and casual users and business folks for example real estate agents who want to print pics of specific rooms for clients without delay may appreciate pogos portability
2251947 t he pictures are dry as soon as they develop and you never replace
2251948 the print quality isnt the sharpest weve seen but for pure convenience and dare we say it fun its great value even the paper is a lot cheaper than traditional instant film
2251949 i was disappointed that it does not work with all bluetooth phones jon pollock a polaroid spokesman said the pogo is compatible with about 80 percent of the bluetooth phones sold during the past two years i tested it with 11 phones and was able to print from only five of them one phone thats noticeably absent from the list of compatible phones on polaroids web site is the apple iphone
2251950 the heat sensitive paper is well rather sensitive after my colleague printed out a pic of a ferrari he instinctively started shaking it to make it develop although the image was fully baked the tight grip of his thumb and forefinger on the thermal paper actually discolored it slightly word to the wise if you scoop up a pogo keep your shots away from moderate heat
2251951 battery life could be longer print quality could be much better but if you need something like this theres nothing else like it
2251952 think of this as really the new polaroid print unexpected saturated colors with imperfect photos in general id say its imperfections in terms of image quality is aesthetically cool
2251953 the pogo prints arent going to compete with specialist photographic services or even the larger inkjet photo printers that you can buy these days but you have to remember this is a printer that fits in your pocket when you consider that you can produce prints practically anywhere and any time then you begin to see where this little gadget will find its market
2251954 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
2251955 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
2251956 weve just got to get some guys back who are on the dl and maybe if we can add here and there i think we certainly have a chance id like to be a part of it thats great
2251957 we were just really lucky that no one else had hired him he was the right guy at the right time we never had any doubts that hed be back
2251958 cito is going to have a big hand in what kind of staff we have here
2251959 its important that hes comfortable with the staff i think bringing gene tenace and nick leyva here was important to him at that time well see how it goes
2251960 its a big job but its well worth the time
2251961 we are just right now concentrating on all the families and our employees
2251962 we are very concerned about them because we are very tight knit
2251963 im so thankful because hes just lucky to be alive
2251964 you cant be in a crash like that and not hurt

2251966 the correspondence that we received stated that it is their intention to pursue judicial review proceedings against the eight match suspension that was imposed on the player having been found to be in breach of the associations disciplinary procedures in respect of unacceptable conduct
2251967 we have now written to the club to tell them that unless proceedings have been initiated by 5pm on tuesday 12 august 2008 then the suspension will be applied
2251968 but what is the difference between a golf course and the facilitiy thats in there now with wall to wall people and wall to wall cars parking all over the place taking over the heart of the park
2251969 the focus will be on preserving the parks natural state
2251970 you never learn do you youre still feeding the deer
2251971 im not feeding the deer theres hardly any deer left
2251972 i know ass hole they were killed because of you
2251973 i dont want you in this park any more i better not see you in this park again
2251974 why are you going to arrest me i have not done anything im not here to feed the deer im here to see how many deer are still left in the park ive only seen 2 doe in the 5 times i have been to the park
2251975 and they are going to kill the rest of them because of you
2251976 by dismissing the charge the public would realize that there exists a system of checks and balances that unfair unjust and poorly written rules and regulations will not automatically be rubber stamped
2251977 it was your legislator who initiated the no feeding ban
2251978 it was your legislature who initiated the no feeding ban
2251979 jim snider the biologist from the d e c gave us strict orders when we trap an animal not to take it back to its natural habitat but to drown the animal immediately
2251980 we would never do this we would take the animal back to its natural habitat and release it
2251981 quinn did a nice job of directing the long drive
2251982 i thought that was important when he made a bad play he had the confidence to come back
2251983 picks happen that didnt bother me for me at least i thought the most important thing the touchdown drive did was with the momentum it gave us
2251984 the wall wasnt there yet so i had to slow up for a second to wait for the wall to get there
2251985 they laid some great blocks and i just took off
2251986 out of all of those things which one makes you feel the most stress
2251987 for me its going into first grade but we dont talk about that much

2252029 although vaccination is one of the most cost effective forms of prevention against infectious disease it remains controversial within the chiropractic community most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects claiming that it is hazardous or ineffective evidence based chiropractors have embraced vaccination but a minority of the profession rejects it as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that diseases cannot be affected by vaccines
2252030 straight chiropractors adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by d d and b j palmer and retain metaphysical definitions and vitalistic qualities
2252031 when facts come in the door vitalism flies out of the window
2252032 knowledge which is only available to a narrow circle of

2252056 merupakan cara kampunagn untuk menyelesaikan perhitungan dengan musuh musuh borjuis dengan absolutisme feodalisme dan kemurtadan isme
2252057 tetunya tidak dengan cara apapun membuang kelayakan dari sebagian dari episode pengambil alihan kekuasaan dan pembentukan komune komune revolusioner dalam satu atau beberapa yang lain atau dalam satu distrik atau yang lain khususnya untuk tujuan membantu menyebarkan insureksi dan mengacaukan pemerintah
2252058 hanya dalam satu kejadian seharusnya sosial demokrasi dengan inisiatifnya sendiri mengarahkan usaha usaha untuk pengambil alihan kekuasaan dan menjaganya selama mungkin yaitu dalam kejadian revolusi yang meluas pada negeri negeri maju di eropa barat dimana kondisi kondisi demi pencapaian sosialisme telah mencapai tingkat kedeasaan tertentu
2252059 dengan mendasarkan taktik taktiknya terhadap pengharapan yang selama seluruh periode revolusioner partai sosial demokratik akan menopang pijakannya pada oposisi ekstrem revolusioner terhadap semua pemerintahan yang bisa berhasil satu hal atau yang lainnya dalam bidang revolusi sosial demokrasi paling baik akan mampu mempersiapkan dirinya untuk memanfaatkan kekuasaan pemerintahan jika pemerintahan itu jatuh kedalam tangannya
2252060 persoalan sikap sosil demokrasi terhadap pemerintahan sementara revolusioner telah dibereskan oleh kawan kawan kaukasia dalam semangat oposisi paling terkemuka terhadap metode baru yang dibela oleh kelompok vperyod dan delegasi delegasi yang bergabung dalam apa yang disebut konggres
2252061 harus diakui bahwa formualsi tentang taktik partai proletariat dalam revolusi borjuis adalah yang paling tepat
2252062 mengingat kami mempertimbangkannya menjadi tugas kita untuk mengambil keuntungan dari situasi revolusioner sedemikian rupa seperti memperdalam tentu
2252063 bahwa pendirian sebuah pemerintahan semnetara adalah sebuah cara yang memungkinkan dan layak untuk memajukan revolusi tetapi menolak kelayakan dari partisipasi sosial demokrasi dalam pemerintahan sementara kaum borjuis tepatnya untuk berkemampuan di masa depan untuk mendapatkan kendali sepenuhnya dari mesin negara untuk sebuah revolusi sosialis

2252307 iraqi politicians officials and western diplomats have speculated that the political parties in government were never invested in holding a vote this year out of fear they would lose seats and influence at the provincial level senior politicians including president jalal talabani a kurd and vice president tariq hashimi a sunni arab have been absent from baghdad during the round the clock negotiations citing medical reasons
2252308 the elections would be the first provincial balloting in almost four years
2252309 i listened to many of them i noticed that most of them talk about kirkuk in a way as if its a prey for the greed and abmitions of their parties they never talk about it as a part of iraq because they dont care about iraq they care only about their limited personal interests
2252310 special inspector general for iraq reconstructions recent findings about how rich iraq is with oil money
2252311 yes its true that the iraqi government is spending little on reconstruction the weak iraqi capability to do big projects maybe at the end of 2008 will improve
2252312 signs of iraqs slowness to rebuild are everywhere in baghdad roughly 20 of the city is without proper sewage pipes published statistics say the baghdad is getting roughly 11 hours of electricity a day on average but many residents go days with only sporadic bursts of power iraqi officials say fixing just this problem could take up to 10 years chronic electricity shortages for another decade mean little energy for construction making iraqi hopes for a renewed capital seem distant
2252313 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2252314 this is projected and not real money we have many reconstruction projects and as you know most of the infrastruture of the country had collapsed after the war and that needs a lot of money to rebuild the country
2252315 as of december 31 2007 the iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of 29 4 billion held in the development fund for iraq and central government deposits at the central bank of iraq and iraqs commerical banks
2252316 from 2005 through 2007 the iraqi government generated an estimated 96 billion in cumulative revenues of which crude oil export sales accounted for about 90
2252317 with oil prices at or near all time highs it has become increasingly apparent that iraq is closer than ever to financial independence with the extreme property damage caused by an invasion of questionable legality the need for security and reconstruction monies is great but who should be held accountable many us taxpayers are becoming disenchanted due to the fact that with nearly 33 billion in oil earnings in the first half of 2008 iraq is now capable of shouldering an increased share of the burden our own economy is floundering and many simply feel that it is time for iraq to step up and assume control over its own destiny
2252318 two numbers 482 billion and 79 billion the first is next years projected federal budget deficit a record the second is the budget surplus that iraq is expected to accumulate by the end of the year is there any question which government whose taxpayers should be footing the bill for reconstruction projects in iraq
2252319 something is out of whack iraqis are very proud to say that its their country and they are right so they should fix it
2252320 many iraqis who lack adequate electricity clean water and jobs find it unfathomable their country is awash in oil dollars last year it spent less than a third of the 12 billion budgeted for major projects such as electricity housing and water
2252321 five star hotels parking garages a theater restaurant aquarium and basketball courts casino and boat rides but given the lagging basic services reporters questioned whether baghdads priorities are appropriate and realistic with temperatures hittign 130 degrees many parts of iraq dont have a steady electricity supply and some areas only get two hours a day getting clean water and adequate health care are also major issues

2252324 you got two choices you stay home and not vote or if you want your vote to mean something and you want to be with the winner you vote for one of the two major party candidates otherwise you are wasting your vote
2252325 were those voters in the 19th century who spun off from the whigs and the democrats and didnt try to spin the difference between these two parties on slavery waste their vote
2252326 ive done surveys and polls all over the country heres my conclusion 15 of the republicans will vote for the republican nominee if the republican nominee was leon trotsky and 15 of the democrats would vote for the democratic nominee if the nominee was ayn rand

2252331 nader accuses the news media of being in a cultural rut by ignoring him he said hed been on national television only 10 seconds this election cycle put me in all the debates and well have a three way race
2252332 the media is in a cultural rut i am not talking about their private incisive skeptical conversations with one another i am talking about the questions they dont ask the questions they ask give me a bunch of 10 year olds instead of the white house press corps and the president would be far far more upset and anxious dont be so cynical about small starts if nature was like you seeds would never have a chance to sprout

2252336 we are seeing more momentum behind blu ray as hdtv penetration continues to grow
2252337 it should be a strong holiday for the format theres no more competition from hd dvd theres no more consumer confusion and more content is becoming available on blu ray even sales of up converting dvd players that are competitive with blu ray are good for the format because it shows consumers are willing to invest more in output

2252360 developed methods and benchmarks of thoroughness and accuracy for documentary publication that were so path breaking that all previous such publication was rendered inadequate and incomplete and all subsequent such publication has had to try to live up to those standards
2252361 what has been achieved thus far with the publication of the founders is all of write good history accurate history because materials have been brought together by fine scholars their value is unassailable and immeasurable the footnotes are gold etc david mccullough

2252377 the resolution of the pictures is not comparison quality different angles are not a scientific way to examine photographs especially to back up an argument different angles are there to give an overall view only but not for comparison it has to theoretically be an exact of the one you are comparing it against changes in muscle movements in various photographs cannot be seen with the naked eye but can change measurements if you are comparing only photographs that is why unless you can see beneath the skin to the actual muscle then you cannot say precisely what a facial measurement is especially using two photographs that are that dissimilar in expression for comparison

2252387 after weeks of late night negotiations and under intense u s pressure iraqi lawmakers failed to pass a much debated provincial elections law wednesday before adjourning for the month the failure to pass the law which would govern elections in provinces across the country may push the elections into next year if elections dont happen by the end of this year it could be july before the balloting could be carried out u n spokesman said arikat said
2252388 a special session of parliament sometime during the recess which ends sept 9
2252389 days of intense negotiations and heavy pressure from the u s the united nations and britain
2252390 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a local elections law
2252391 its interesting what i find interesting about this report as well is when youre looking at these two countries iraq and afghanistan seeing how vastly different iraq is from afghanistan in terms of the natural resources that they have afghanistan is a very poor country one of the poorest in the world iraq will come back much faster given that they had some semblance of infrastructure as crumbling as it was but something to work from afghanistan is being built from scratch and so i thought that was something worth taking away
2252392 i saw the report i saw the reports about the report so id refer you back to the state department just to as they wake up this moring just to make sure that theyve looked at it because i dont know all the details
2252393 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
2252394 weve done a lot for the iraqis just in terms of the numbers themselves
2252395 ill tell you what concerns me and most of my constituents you said many times the gains in iraq are fragile and reversable so my constituents and i believe that
2252396 you have to wonder why the best that you can say is that the gains are fragile and reversable
2252397 and i listened carefully to senator hagel and ambassador crocker from the answer you gave him i dont get the
2252398 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
2252399 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
2252400 iraqs oil income will more than double this year baghdad continues to spend only a small percentage of its own money on reconstruction and services while it banks billions in surplus funds
2252401 between 2005 and 2007 only 10 percent of iraqs expenditures went toward reconstruction with just 1 percent spent on maintaining u s and iraqi funded investments in roads water electricity and weapons according to a report released yesterday by the government accountability office even when baghdad has allocated larger sums the report said it has spent only a small portion of the budgeted money
2252402 left little doubt that iraq which racked up 32 9 billion in oil earnings from january through june can afford to pay more for its own reconstruction
2252403 driving through iraq you feel the neglect here in basra the city is rivers of sewage destroyed buildings and bridges from war after war after war every day i pass by the same buildings destroyed years ago during the u s led invasion in my neighborhood in baghdad every day they look exactly the same a pile of rubble the electricity problem seems to be getting worse iraqis have an average of about four hours of electricity a day while there is talk of reconstruction a bridge here flowers planted there the people dont feel a change
2252404 one thing thats very important is how they are spending their money which is distributing it evenly amongst the around the country but amongst the different sects as well so shias sunnis and kurds its something that theyre going to have to continue to work out we want them to take on more of their own responsibilities just from a security standpoint but also reconstruction also if you remember prime minister maliki went into sadr city basra and mosul he offered immediate financial assistance to people who were living there under those terrible conditions
2252405 it is good for their psychological health it is good to take care of the appearance to see the building a new clean
2252406 school kits to iraqi refugee children distribution of uniforms shoes and school materials and is expected to outfit 30 000 children from damascus and rural damascus before the start of the syrian school year on sept 7 last year unhcrs distribution reached 20 000 iraqi children
2252407 its really important that they figure out a way to quickly get that money to those people directly i think theyve made a lot of progress on that but they needed to do more
2252408 notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of armored security vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 206 milliion
2252409 the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of light armored vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 3 billion the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of technical assistance for construction of facilities and infrastructure as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 1 6 billiion the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of helicopters and related munitions as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 2 4 billion

2252417 particularly with goaltenders the cardinal rule is dont get beat five hole
2252418 you get beat once fine if you get beat twice youre done youre sitting on the bench if you can plant a seed of doubt in the goaltenders that you can get beat there and youre vulnerable in that spot the head worms start going and once they start going in a goaltenders game hes in big trouble

2252500 we had a hard fought campaign and it was exciting it was a bit like the proverbial rollercoaster but we are now unified and ready to go forward together and it is imperative that each and every one of us think about how were going to help in this election
2252501 we are one party we share one vision and we believe as democrats as independents and repentant republicans in the progress we can make together
2252502 were still working out the mechanics of the four days and our staffs are in communication with sen clintons staffs but i dont anticipate any problems
2252503 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2252504 i know from just what im hearing theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen
2252505 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
2252506 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2252507 hes been very supportive i thought he showed extraordinary restraint in a fairly provocative interview while he was on his trip i couldnt ask for him to be any more gracious than hes been and supportive since the campaign ended
2252508 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2252509 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2252510 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2252511 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path
2252512 who will take the final steps to 1600 pennsylvania avenue
2252513 a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular hard working people
2252514 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea and worry about the price of arugula
2252515 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
2252516 and he has anointed himself ready to carry the burden of the one he can do no wrong can you see the light
2252517 i think all of us would slit our wrists if it wasnt for that
2252518 its august and in august its harder to get attention from the electorate and the issues while theyre important often take a back seat to peoples personal schedules
2252519 its a lot harder to tell jokes than it used to be
2252520 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2252521 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2252522 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2252523 my friends used to go up to niagra falls on the canadian side to fill their prescriptions i cant even afford that
2252524 i lost my job and with my job i lost my health insurance
2252525 our sales team ensures that they constantly update the saving incentives in our program
2252526 now i dont have to choose between food and my medication nobody should have to live like that and now i dont have to either
2252527 i have known dr schlichtemeier since 1981 and i have the utmost respect for him as a highly trained and ethical corneal and refractive surgeon
2252528 bill has always been at the forefront in the field of refractive surgery and he is one of only a handful of surgeons to perform the classic barraquer techniques of keratomileusis and epikeratophakia these complex techniques laid the foundation for modern lasik surgery which only became possible with the introduction of the excimer laser
2252529 i determine if it is safe to have laser vision correction i prepare the laser plan and do the laser treatment and i do all the post operative examinations i dont delegate those important details to non physicians i think you can get better results that way
2252530 the nurses have accused me of being too particular there are probably worse things to be accused of
2252531 iran has a way out if they ever wish but we will seriously pursue sanctions if they dont
2252532 you have to hope that there are reasonable people in iran who see this as not the way to run a country
2252533 they should have felt like time is running out quite a long time ago
2252534 when you are having trouble getting banks to come in getting investment when export credits are going down from around the world when you have inflation roaring time is running out

2252551 i was threatened by the religious fundamentalists in my country bangladesh they have decreed a fatwa against me and set a price on my head not only that i am a criminal according to the government of my country too the government there has banned my book and issued an arrest warrant against me for committing blasphemy i was forced to leave my country since 6 years i have been living in exile i was born in a muslim family but i became an atheist in course of my training in science i developed the powers of observation experiment analysis and reasoning without reasoning i found nothing should be accepted as fact i have been fighting against injustice unreason and prejudice i exposed the crimes of religion particularly the injustice and oppression against women it makes me surprised that some western states have declared the protection of human rights to be one of their supreme objectives but then they patronized fundamentalism both overtly and covertly democratic governments recognize military dictatorships for short run political interests secular states make friends with autocracies as well as theocracies they even tolerate the completely inhuman behavior of their own fundamentalists such double standards practiced by so called democratic and secular states at home and abroad give the fundamentalists a sort of legitimacy governments then have to succumb to the fundamentalists pressure and proscribe books and make arrangements to send its writers and authors to prison some westerners argue that not all the customs in the third world countries are harmful for women they find a sort of stability and social peace in the oriental world it is nonsense for me there can be no difference in the concept of human rights between the east and the west if the veil is bad for western women then it is bad for their oriental sisters as well if patriarchy is to be fought against in the west it should be equally fought against in the east the fight in fact is more urgent there because most of the women have neither any education nor any economic independence if modern secular education is good for western women why should the eastern women be deprived of it the fundamentalists cannot be countered without a relentless and uncompromising fight the struggle should be both theoretical and tactical democracy and secularism should be applied in practice and not remain a mere play of words is an ideology that diverts people from the path of natural development of consciousness and undermines their personal rights fundamentalists do not believe in individualism liberty of personal choice or plurality of thought moreover as they are believers in a particular faith they believe only in propagating their own ideas as autocrats generally do they do not encourage or entertain free debate they deny others the right to express their own views freely and they cannot tolerate anything which they perceive as going against their faith i believe in fundamental rights of human beings to express themselves orally or in their writings in equal rights for women in every sphere of life and in constructing a society in which everybody gets a fair deal we all should work for it media is helpful for spreading the ideas of human rights and for media to work the state has to be secular the religious laws has to be abolished to create uniform civil code in which women get equalities education of course secular education is important for women to get the knowledge about their rights religious education and politics based on religion must be banned to save the mankind as they are not banned in my country and the country is not secular i as a writer and journalist once worked in media was prevented to express my ideas and thoughts it is impossible to have coexistence of religion and freedom of expression

2252559 i have great affection for elizabeth edwards and i consider her a close personal friend
2252560 im deeply saddened by this news and my sympathies goes out to the edwards family and her children
2252561 no one in this life is perfect and john is a good guy i supported him in 2004 but decided not to this time around mainly because of issues around campaigning
2252562 this is a terrible tragedy and everyone has good luck and bad luck and recently they have had a string of bad luck
2252563 if the economics fit for additional expansion it should be evaluated
2252564 we have retained counsel and we did file an opposition to a request to certify this bargaining unit
2252565 at this point we await the response of the union representative and the public employee labor relations board
2252566 when dealing with labor relations you have to avoid unfair labor practices
2252567 there are many reasons why people want to unionize but primarily its to have a collective bargaining unit to spell out their benefit package
2252568 i support the school boards decision to go to the left i think thats the only logical design
2252569 i think going to the right would be fiscally not as attractive and provide a school that is not quite as attractive
2252570 ive thought about this a long time and i think the education of our children is the most important thing we do when it comes down to it if the ball players need to play on different field i will support eminent domain
2252571 one of the main jobs of the council is managing the city purse strings and all the money that is spent to keep the city one of the best places to live
2252572 i think the budget process is one of the most important things the council does and i have a lot of experience doing that
2252573 its great to be back absolutely brilliant weve had a long pre season so everyone is looking forward to it weve talked extensively about what we want to do and how we will approach the game
2252574 we want three points and have a great opportunity with our first game at home we cant ask for any more that that it is a winnable game on what is the first time weve been at home on the first day for a good few years so everything is set up nicely
2252575 im confident in the players weve got theres no doubt about it if we stay away from significant injuries we have a decent chance of a good season we have a quality defence we have added new players to our midfield where sean mcallister is also emerging and we have goals in us
2252576 its like everybody else is feeling across the country weve worked hard in pre season and you just look forward to the first ball rolling and getting on with the championship which we know is a tough division
2252577 we all just want saturday to come quickly the lads have worked ever so hard and we think we have got them in a good physical condition and touch wood they will stay injury free
2252578 we knew we already had a good team spirit and we have signed some new players that we have tried to integrate into the group hopefully that will bear fruit when the season starts
2252579 were pleased with the acquisitions we have made they have settled in well and shown the qualities which proved why we brought them to the football club in the first place i would still like to add one or two more if possible though so we will see if that comes to fruition
2252580 we all want to win games but equally we want to do that with a good style of football and our new signings have been conducive to that
2252581 ive got no doubts that it will be as difficult and tight as it was last year there are some good sides who have come down too and there will be an imbalance with the parachute payments but we know we have good players who can win games
2252582 it will be ultra competitive so we just have to make sure we are at our best and do that consistently if we do that we can win games but we know each and every match will be tough
2252583 we will make no claims all i will say is home or away we will try and win every game we will set our stall out to be positive and pay the utmost respect to the opposition because there are some quality sides in the championship
2252584 we know the fans are vociferous and will get behind the lads so we want to give them a team to be proud of we have tried to lower the age level with the younger players we have brought in because we want to build a team for years to come that will serve burnley well
2252585 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
2252586 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2252587 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2252588 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life

2252593 it is not permitted to look at these serials or watch them they contain so much evil they destroy peoples ethics and are against our values
2252594 any tv station that airs them is against god and his messenger peace be upon him these are serials of immorality they are prepared by people who are specialists in crime and error people who invite men and women to the devil

2252611 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2252612 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2252613 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage
2252614 to renounce violence and participate peacefully in the iraqi political process
2252615 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
2252616 if we find this does not happen and the u s forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also

2252687 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
2252688 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
2252689 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
2252690 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable

2252692 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers

2252699 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
2252700 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
2252701 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
2252702 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
2252703 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise

2252724 they dont respect us so lets surprise them well drop the big one and pulverise them

2252728 if you dont reach the goals you are put on probation and terminated so it seemed like the best way that we could do is give the program up and give it to another donor center
2252729 i think its sad that we have to give it up but the national requirements are so strict we cant continue with the program

2252736 i think this whole thing is racist and im totally offended by it
2252737 but it just shows you how low theyll go it shows you that it doesnt matter what the truth is theyre going to trump stuff up so im not afraid of making decisions independently and standing by them
2252738 that was obviously far more offensive than anything weve put out there
2252739 im certain that our ads didnt have a bunch of indians wearing feathered headdresses dancing around with tomahawks that would have been racist
2252740 the intelligence suggests that a paedophile network in belgium put out an order for a young girl three days before madeleine was taken

2252753 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2252754 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2252755 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2252756 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2252760 the percentage increase in electricity bills could fall by three quarters
2252761 although we were not able to test these payloads in space nasa achieved success in these two low cost missions by rapidly pulling together expertise

2252764 i was in the second lane going around and had run up there already and was up there flat out and then the car started to understeer a little bit
2252765 i started to turn into the corner but it wouldnt turn and then i hit i was wondering if it was the bottoming out of the car that made it lose the front grip or if it was dirty off line but the fact it wouldnt turn at all when i tried to turn the wheel made me think something broke thats what it felt like but i dont want to say that was it for sure
2252766 they have a lot of work to do to fix that car
2252767 the car was fast in the first practice things had been going all right until that it was a slam a pretty hard impact my helmet looks pretty bad because a tire came up and bumped it at the end but im fine
2252768 i was running third or fourth when i came in and i spun coming out of pit lane and nearly hit the safety truck
2252769 i was pretty close because the tired blew out because i had a blistered tire so ive had some bad luck here but in the past ive been fast

2252790 its important for people to know that solace found is not just selling products it is a vehicle to alter those moods that oftentimes accompany changing times with something as simple as a comforting cashmere throw or splashing on that special eau de toilette after bathing in wonderful bath salts
2252791 it is a humbling experience to have our investors profit advisory honored so highly by peers the newsletters circulation has increased exponentially over the last few years and this honor will help us grow its readership even faster
2252792 this is like buddy holly the day the music died it is sad for all sports fans because this guy was not done it is not that he was hanging on
2252793 this is in many ways sad that this is where it came to at the end of the day though we felt like i think all the parties involved felt like it was the best solution to a very difficult situation
2252794 but the relationship got to the point where it couldnt go forward dont try to blame either side its like a marriage that ends it happens and neither party is at fault but you move forward
2252795 i think were all sad to see brett favres career as a packer end but we are glad that this matter has come to closure in a way thats good for the team and good for brett
2252796 i was just looking for him to tell me that he was ready to play for the green bay packers
2252797 and if we would have got to that point then our conversation would have continued and it did not get to that point
2252798 despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot
2252799 id love to see him have the time of his life
2252800 i told him he could help with the quarterbacks but i dont want any new plays
2252801 this is important to him he recognizes that when you step out of whats happened and everything he has a very positive opinion about the fans the experience hes had with his family he didnt want to do this to his teammates any more he felt it clearly went on long enough
2252802 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and a player
2252803 he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything he has done
2252804 im happy with the people we have here right now
2252805 we have three quarterbacks right now on the team and were finding it hard right now to get all three of those guys the work they need but were doing that
2252806 there was no negotiation there was never any substantive talk of what they would take
2252807 all of that was speculation from the beginning i think it was clear it was a bad situation in green bay and they had to deal with it any way they could
2252808 green bay never told us what they were interested in trading him for
2252809 really it never got to any of that he wasnt a free agent we never believed they were going to release him that wasnt their intention it wasnt that type of process
2252810 i said we never believed they were going to trade him to the buccaneers
2252811 were going to listen to peoples thoughts if theres a way itll benefit the buccaneers
2252812 coach gruden and jeffs relationship goes back a long way the american way is competition i dont think any outside forces are going to affect this football team

2252823 women are very big on coupons and they tend to be more of the money savers
2252824 but men tend to be more into bargaining and thats something women can learn from
2252825 we found that 1 out of every 4 couples say they fight in public while theyre shopping
2252826 and hes the guy who runs into stores like hes running into a burning building
2252827 he grabs whatever he needs and runs out he might not even try anything on
2252828 for him you want to have a game plan before you leave the house say hey were going to spend an hour in this store or a half hour in this store to buy this or browse for this and in that way you can slow him down and shopping will be much more productive
2252829 and the only way to deal with a waiter and a whiner is to send him on an errand when he starts getting agitated send him to the food court make sure he has his ipod with him look for stores that have seating so thats a great strategy for that personality
2252830 they have to look and touch every digital camera even if they already own one
2252831 they have to look at al the television sets the way to deal with that person is to set a time limit and say ok youre allowed to spend x amount of time in the electronic section or the electronics store and then you could go off and do your own thing during that time
2252832 and the way to deal with this person is to agree on a budget
2252833 say ok youve got 250 or 300 to spend this month on whatever you want if you go beyond that limit you have to let me know and we have to discuss it so you have to reign him in
2252834 in our tests of portable folding chairs we were looking for how heavy they were how easy they were to take out of the bag put back in the bag how comfortable they were and how the fabric held up in a lot of different durability tests
2252835 we tested the chairs to see what kind of weight they could hold also if there were any safety issues if there were fingers getting pinched we found a few chairs that cost 40 or under
2252836 this is a comfortable chair because its got a padded back a wide seat
2252837 it also has a extra large cup holder and a cooler that holds small bottles
2252838 it would be really easy to throw in the back of your car take to a soccer game or whatever you need to go to
2252839 broadcasters have no idea how they will fill the extra channels theyll get on february 18 2009

2252841 we began to work it very hard and developed a number of sources
2252842 because of the questions we were asking that finally prodded edwards to come clean about the affair
2252843 you can say that for the first time in his life mudcat refused to comment
2252844 obviously unless he heals his family he can never heal his career
2252845 but supposing he does that yes he can come back divorce was once a career ender then newt gingrich about his infidelity nor my old boss maybe folks are starting to practice what they preach about letting he who is without sin cast the first stone
2252846 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down

2252894 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2252895 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2252896 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2252897 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2252898 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years
2252899 and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2252900 the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2252901 i am disappointed and angry thousands of friends and supporters of put their faith and confidence in him and he has let them down
2252902 young supporters who put their time and energy into his campaign with a newfound energy and idealism for politics have been betrayed by his actions but the issues we cared about and fought for poverty worker justice clean environment and health care for all are issues worth continuing to fight
2252903 people are human and they make mistakes i feel bad for his family and i feel bad for him im sure this is one of those times when being human catches up with you
2252904 anybody looking at this its going to be difficult for john in the future politically
2252905 he was running for president whats he supposed to do admit it
2252906 you can say that for the first time in his life mudcat refused to comment
2252907 my thoughts and prayers are with the sen barack obama d ill the presumptive democratic nominee declined to comment on the revelation
2252908 i assume he wont come to the convention and i assume he wont ask to speak
2252909 if hes going to have any public role at all hes going to have to convince people that hes genuinely sorry not only about what he did but about the lying
2252910 obviously unless he heals his family he can never heal his career
2252911 but supposing he does that yes he can come back divorce was once a career ender then newt gingrich about his infidelity nor my old boss maybe folks are starting to practice what they preach about letting he who is without sin cast the first stone
2252912 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2252913 it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2252914 under assumed names in a series of expensive homes in north carolina and more recently in santa barbara california
2252915 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2252916 lo que me preocupa son los ni os que mueren en darfur no pueden so ar con estar en los juegos ol mpicos o con ser m dicos quiero que esos ni os puedan cumplir sus sue os

2252924 accurate and timely weather information is a critical tool for helping growers make crop management decisions
2252925 we are pleased that 21 acres farm contacted us about setting up a station and that weve been able to add stations to help growers in southwestern washington we are always interested in hearing from potential site sponsors especially in areas that currently have limited coverage
2252926 our mission includes education and community engagement around issues of sustainable agriculture and having the station on site really advances our work
2252927 well use the information generated with our farmers onsite from growing washington as well as in our education programs we want t o explore expanding this partnership to add other stations on the property in the future for example to inform our orchard management
2252928 the brady bottoms area is one of the most intensely farmed areas in our county with most of our cannery pea and sweet corn production located there
2252929 this is an important tool in helping growers schedule both cultural practices and pest management programs for maximum efficiency and the best part is that the information is readily available at any time and easy to access
2252930 its huge when it comes to timing for planting and harvesting especially with hay
2252931 if we know whats coming well run around the clock if needed
2252932 the presidents authority to capture and detain al qaeda agents who like the 9 11 hijackers come to this country to commit or facilitate warlike acts
2252933 presidents most sweeping claims of unchecked and unreviewable executive detention power
2252934 effectively allows the president to seize any person in the united states a citizen or noncitizen and detain them indefinitely without trial
2252935 cripples the most important constitutional right of all the right to be charged and tried if suspected of wrongdoing
2252936 we cannot agree that congress silently authorized a detention power that so vastly exceeds all traditional bounds
2252937 as the speed of global interactions and processes increases there is an intense diffusion of ideas goods information and people
2252938 it is predicted that by 2010 forty percent of the worlds workforce will be in china and india

2252943 were the only country in the world to follow up ambitious pledges by putting them into practice
2252944 wed like to see other countries start at the very least to meet their own kyoto targets
2252945 given current market conditions it appears that world oil prices are on a path that more closely resembles the projection in the high price case than the reference case
2252946 a large part of the domestic oil resource base has been produced new oil reservoir discoveries are expected to be smaller with a few exceptions the remaining domestic petroleum basins have been significantly depleted
2252947 not only the adequacy of the uks targets but also the lack of progress that has been made toward achieving them
2252948 we find it highly unlikely that given current progress the uk will meet the governments ambition for 10 per cent of electricity to be generated from renewables by 2010 let alone the ec mandated target for 2020
2252949 im going to talk to other teams in the nascar paddock

2252956 id like to do more races but the deal was always that bryan clauson and i would share so i dont think its fair now that my circumstances have changed that he should suddenly give up the ride i think theyre doing the fair thing
2252957 im glad to put an end to all the rumors and speculation and solidify my position at dei
2252958 a lot of it has been a distraction its been hard dealing with all the rumors a lot of people are critical of dei for the wrong reasons that i dont think are fair to the people who put their heart and soul into company were getting stronger as a company and a race team
2252959 the spirit of the games has always been about bringing the world closer together so its fitting that social networking sites like facebook that easily connect people around the world can be leveraged to create socially driven applications such as mypicks beijing 2008
2252960 the zembly team is thrilled to work with pramati technologies to enable new forms of applications for facebook and demonstrate the exciting possibilities of zembly pramati technologies is incredibly happy to work with zembly to provide facebook users around the globe with a simple exciting way to celebrate the 2008 summer games by providing a complete hosted environment for creating and scaling social applications zembly has created a new way for developers of all skill levels to easily build facebook applications without the cost and complexity of hosting and managing the application themselves

2252989 breast feeding is associated with resilience against the psychosocial stress linked with parental divorce separation
2252990 theres a lot less verbal communication but lots of tactile communication and eye contact that promotes positive physiological responses
2252991 breast feeding does seem to suppress stress responses in babies and it does seem that theres a protective effect
2252992 in terms of the biological possibility breast milk is pretty amazing stuff and the tactile interaction that goes along with breast feeding does have an influence on the development of neurons
2252993 for most mothers breast feeding doesnt come naturally if the baby doesnt latch on it can lead to feelings of failure and concern about whether or not the baby is getting enough milk women need lots of encouragement and education
2252994 breast feeding is something for mothers and babies to enjoy a time for them to cherish and nurture each other
2252995 it makes it a lot harder to hit fairways when the wind is blowing like this youve got to hit it right down the middle and you cant really attack these greens from the rough
2252996 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2252997 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today

2253051 and remember that one post about how he went sharking at that bar but just didnt feel up to it and everyone was smiling and laughing but he just kind of sat there passing the beer between his hands slowly thoughtfully and then he went to the bathroom and splashed some cold water on his face and he came out and all his bros were just like standing there like marionettes without strings and he just had that deep sense of despair that he would never escape this life or whatever it is and suddenly he felt very trapped and angry and that blonde smiled at him and he grinned back and decided that if depression is anger turned inward than maybe sex can be anger turned outward
2253052 i heard that tucker once rocked back and forth in the bathtub for three hours whilst listening to dave matthews band crash into me on repeat
2253053 kinda like the one time tucker was in the mall and he walked into express to check out some threads and like express has the chick section too so its totally a great place to glance across the aisle at some honeys in their natural habitat and then he totally spotted this one hottie so he decided to walk up to her but he wasnt sure if he should notice her shoes or her eyes or if she would want to get married someday so he just kinda dropped his jaw and touched her hair and she totally just gave him this
2253054 remember the time tucker called the phone sex chat line and started jerkin it to this girl talking about blowing him and his friend both and then at the end when he came he started crying and she said
2253055 i cant afford this and im not talking about the money im talking about the psychic toll semi anonymous encounters are taking on me i used to think it was all for fun and now i think its like an addiction
2253056 and like there was that one post about how he totally swore off everything completely and went on a broliday with his bros but then like the bro bus broke down in front of this crazy run down motel next to a strip club and there wasnt anything else for a bunch of dudes to do until aaa came with some gas ride it til e bro that shit aint cheap these days and a bro needs his brewskis so like they went in to check out the local talent and it turned out that tucker got with this one chick who was the motels owners daughter and he watched it all go down from the back of the club shaking silently with feelings he didnt understand at how bored she looked while he and his bros all smiled and laughed
2253057 remember when tucker wrote about the time he sat down at the edge of the bed with his head in his hands while the blonde was taking a shower and he looked up into the mirror above his bureau and noticed the circles under his eyes were darker than hed ever seen them before and he wondered how his mother was doing and hoped that maybe today shed kick gary out because she was going nowhere with that guy fast all the while wondering what song the blonde was singing in the shower and when she would leave because she stared at him last night after they had both finished and when a girl stares that means only one thing that she needs to fucking leave now but then she falls asleep and the way her chest rises and falls reminds him of his mother when she was pass out on the couch after jeopardy

2253068 well the word religious can be the subject of long discussions look the gerrer rebbe once said when the haskalah enlightenment came to the world with science physics etc we the religious left it for the secular jews when zionism came to the world we gave that too to the secular and now we have also left the repentance movement for the secular accordingly it looks like we the secular will also have to build the beit hamikdash
2253069 there are many religious authorities including maimonides who say that the temple must be rebuilt and so i think it should be done as a first step we must show that we control the temple mount i call upon all of israel to come to the mount on tisha bav and show that it belongs to the jewish nation

2253128 in psychology there is a concept called learned helplessness which arose from a series of animal experiments in the nineteen sixties at the university of pennsylvania dogs were restrained by a harness so that they couldnt move and then repeatedly subjected to a series of electrical shocks then the same dogs were shocked again only this time they could easily escape by jumping over a low hurdle but most of them didnt they just huddled in the corner no longer believing that there was anything they could do to influence their own fate learned helplessness is now thought to play a role in such phenomena as depression and the failure of battered women to leave their husbands but one could easily apply it more widely we live in an age after all that is strangely fixated on the idea of helplessness were fascinated by hurricanes and terrorist acts and epidemics like sars situations in which we feel powerless to affect our own destiny in fact the risks posed to life and limb by forces outside our control are dwarfed by the factors we can control our fixation with helplessness distorts our perceptions of risk when you feel safe you can be passive rapaille says of the fundamental appeal of the s u v safe means i can sleep i can give up control i can relax i can take off my shoes i can listen to music for years weve all made fun of the middle aged man who suddenly trades in his sedate family sedan for a shiny red sports car thats called a midlife crisis but at least it involves some degree of engagement with the act of driving the man who gives up his sedate family sedan for an s u v is saying something far more troubling that he finds the demands of the road to be overwhelming is acting out really worse than giving up

2253135 i knew with dismay the death of majd abdul aziz al barghouti wrote luisa morgantini on her letter the palestinian authorities has to support and start a transparent inquiry into the incident and in particular making clear the way he was treated inside the detention centre and his health conditions since al barghouti was arrested on 14 february 2008 nby the palestinian general intelligence in the west bank for political reasons and it seems without observance of the legal process its as well necessary to go beyond by examining the way he was caught under arrest confirming or not that he was not presented before a prosecutor or a judge after twenty four hours of detention as stipulated in palestinian penal law continued the letter refusing all logic based on doubled standards i am convinced that its necessary to condemn violence and human rights violations always the palestinian authorities has to support and start a transparent inquiry into the incident and in particular making clear the way he was treated inside the detention centre and his health conditions
2253136 since al barghouti was arrested on 14 february 2008 by the palestinian general intelligence in the west bank for political reasons and it seems without observance of the legal process its as well necessary to go beyond by examining the way he was caught under arrest confirming or not that he was not presented before a prosecutor or a judge after twenty four hours of detention as stipulated in palestinian penal law
2253137 refusing all logic based on doubled standards i am convinced that its necessary to condemn violence and human rights violations always
2253138 ho appreso con sgomento della morte di majd abdul aziz al barghouti ha scritto luisa morgantini nella sua lettera lautorit palestinese deve dare il suo sostegno e avviare uninchiesta trasparente su questo caso e in particolare chiarire il modo in cui al barghouti stato trattato allinterno del centro di detenzione e le sue condizioni di salute
2253139 poich al barghouti stato arrestato lo scorso 14 febbraio dai servizi di intelligence palestinesi della west bank per motivi politici e a quanto pare senza losservanza di un processo legale allo stesso tempo necessario andare pi a fondo esaminando il modo in cui stato tratto in arresto confermando o smentendo il fatto che egli non sia stato condotto davanti a un pubblico ministero o ad un giudice prima delle 24 ore di detenzione come sancito dal codice penale palestinese

2253160 concrete solution for water raising shasta dams height looms large among ideas to boost states dwindling storage by david whitney bee washington bureau published 2 15 am pst monday november 22 2004
2253161 sheri harral public affairs officer at the dam said world war ii and materials shortages associated with the war effort led to a decision to stop construction at 602 feet
2253162 the thinking was to come back and add on to it if ever there was a need to
2253163 if shasta dam had been built up to its engineering limit in 1945 it is arguable that northern and central california would not be facing a critical water shortage now
2253164 according to a 1999 bureau of reclamation study a dam 200 feet taller would be able to triple storage to 13 89 million acre feet of water

2253200 i would rather face bay 25 times with all my respect to bay than face manny 20

2253202 all the work joey cora put in with him in spring training all of a sudden he comes back here and we dont see that
2253203 right now hes not in there because i feel more comfortable catching the ball and not having more offense
2253204 but we need him to step it up and be better in the field
2253205 were hoping to keep progressing but again were trying to listen to the body we dont want to let it get to a point where its a step back
2253206 you need the truth to make the right decision so what ive done is always go three four five layers deep in an organization get people comfortable talking to you
2253207 i know the attention has been on the guys like asafa and usain as well as the americans but it was the same last year
2253208 it doesnt matter to me that people are talking about them because the olympics are the only thing that matters this year and im confident i can be on the podium in beijing
2253209 in beijing it could take running in the 9 7s to get a medal but i think ill be ready to do that
2253210 especially if youre an everyday player the team expects you to be in every day
2253211 right now were trying to find out whether its a mechanical issue or just a fatigue issue
2253212 if we cant get him jump started sooner than later well probably visit the opportunity to give him a breather
2253213 i just havent been swinging the bat well the last week or so
2253214 its just a matter of getting things back on track
2253215 the last couple nights i was just trying not to get too far over
2253216 at third base you kind of just get whatever you can get but at first you have to realize the play is sometimes easier if you let the second baseman get it
2253217 by no means can you expect him to come in and just function at 100 percent defensively at first
2253218 i think hes done an above average job since hes been over there
2253219 but if i do have a stereotype i am my own stereotype its nice to change but you cannot totally give up who you are even if you have a big temptation to do so
2253220 it has been an eventful week with a lot of rumours and a lot of things that people come up with and i have no idea where its coming from
2253221 this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago
2253222 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2253223 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had
2253224 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport
2253225 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year
2253226 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2253227 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2253228 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2253229 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page

2253240 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2253241 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2253242 if i had to live my life without you near me the days would all be empty the nights would seem so long with you i see forever oh so clearly i might have been in love before but it never felt this strong our dreams are young and we both know theyll take us where we want to go hold me now touch me now i dont want to live without you chorus nothings gonna change my love for you you ought to know by now how much i love you one thing you can be sure of ill never ask for more than your love nothings gonna change my love for you you ought to know by now how much i love you if the road ahead is not so easy our love will lead the way for us like a guiding star ill be there for you if you should need me you dont have to change a thing i love you just the way you are so come with me and share the view ill help you see forever too hold me now touch me now i dont want to live without you chorus nothings gonna change my love for you you ought to know by now how much i love you one thing you can be sure of ill never ask for more than your love nothings gonna change my love for you

2253253 he said to appreciate the cool weather up here because it was hot and humid down in georgia
2253254 matt was of course a great quarterback but thats not something that i think about at all i just want to go out and lead the team to as many victories as we can get and hopefully get to another championship game
2253255 i just know that when i have the ball in my hands and the play breaks down that i have the opportunity to run and probably get maybe a couple of extra yards than matt would have
2253256 to make something out of nothing instead of taking a sack
2253257 hes confident back there hes a smart kid hes reading the field well right now and making the right decisions and he knows everyones behind him right now hes in a tough position its his first year and his last year so hes making the most of his opportunity
2253258 they really are starting to build confidence in me or at least i hope so
2253259 something that was different than matt is i know a lot of these guys more personally i was the backup and theyre a little bit closer in grade to me theyll take heed to what i say and its not going to be a stranger asking them to do something or telling them to do something
2253260 i feel like since weve been here weve been underrated from the beginning of the season
2253261 last year we didnt start at no 2 we worked our way up to no 2 so weve got to do the same thing this year

2253301 became a party of insiders and deal makers without any sense of the principles they stood for and eventually collapsed
2253302 certainly you can make the argument that if a partys far enough away from the mainstream if they dont lose they dont get enough impetus to correct their behavior
2253303 court and country in american politics the democratic party and the 1994 election
2253304 court apologists were intensely statist they tried to endow the government with the resources and vigor necessary to command great respect abroad and maintain order at home
2253305 plain distrust of government as such and a considerable sense of apprehension at its ever spreading tentacles
2253306 the british aristocracy we drove out in our revolution has been replaced by our own version a political nobility that is immune to the peoples will they have created through our campaign and lobbying laws a series of incentives that corrupt the intent of the constitution
2253307 purging the house of commons from the dead weight of court officers and dependents
2253308 would you say the government is run by a few big interests looking out for themselves or that it is run for the benefit of all people
2253309 president clinton tried to fix everything at once it was not well received and not only that the democrats got turned out at the next election

2253317 three israeli settlers one masked and wielding a stick pursued fourteen palestinian children who were on their way to a summer camp in at tuwani the children from the villages of tuba and maghaer al abeed waited thirty minutes for the israeli military escort that should have accompanied them on the most direct road between the villages of tuba and at tuwani when the military failed to arrive the children began walking along a long path through the hills to at tuwani when the children neared the israeli settlement outpost of havat maon three settlers with two dogs came out from the outpost and began walking in the direction of the children
2253318 members of the at tuwani team yelled at the children to alert them that settlers were coming at them from behind the children ran down and across a valley to a location further from the settlers they continued to at tuwani the settlers remained on a hill top near havot maon watching the children as they walked toward the school
2253319 the previous day tuesday 22 july the military escort never arrived to escort the children to summer camp seven children took a long path to the school they told the at tuwani team that at least eight other children did not attend summer camp because they were too afraid to come to school without an escort the mayor of at tuwani spoke with israeli military to coordinate the escort for the children however several military spokespersons and soldiers on the ground denied receiving orders to escort the children
2253320 in 2004 the israeli knesset recommended that the israeli military carry out a daily escort of the children of tuba and maghaer al abeed to their school in at tuwani because settlers repeatedly attacked them
2253321 nobody goes to school for how to send your child away from you
2253322 we help the parents become independent and especially post 9 11 in todays society thats definitely a heightened need
2253323 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that that was the studios idea
2253324 and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
2253325 i could sell them the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it
2253326 and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off
2253327 joseph lieberman i conn asked defense secretary robert gates whether baghdad should start paying some u s combat costs and lindsey graham r s c raised the possibility that an anticipated iraqi budget surplus this year could be used to help afghanistan whose 700 million in annual revenue represents a small fraction of iraqs 46 8 billion budget
2253328 iraq would not make 100 billion in oil sales this year unless the price of oil went substantially higher like nearing 200 per barrel and the surplus would be anything beyond the 50 billion 2008 budget which at current oil prices will give it just about a 10 billion surplus
2253329 this begs the question as to whether a country can invade another country which inherently destroys the capital political and societal infrastructure poorly spend both occupying and occupied funds unilaterally create conditions of chaos requiring ongoing security and reconstruction funds and then bind the occupied country to make reparations and take out loans from the occupying country

2253354 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2253355 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2253356 not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts

2253360 obviously after tuesday nights game and what happened in kansas city we needed danks to step up
2253361 facing all of those right handed hitters he was amazing
2253362 my goal was to get us deep into the game
2253363 i knew the guys down there were going to be achy but my goal was to get us into the seventh or eighth hopefully with the lead
2253364 in the bullpen i dont think i even had one break i think i threw one for a strike between innings the changeup was good fastball was good it had command with a little giddy up on it and the cutter bailed me out of big situations
2253365 its a little different but if you can play shortstop you can play second base and third base
2253366 third base moves faster but i just like to play when you dont hit try to do something for the team
2253367 we think weve got enough offense from the first eight to carry us cora said
2253368 we need somebody to catch the ball and uribes been doing a great job hes been playing a heck of a third base
2253369 i see it as winning games win games and keep it going we need to win as many games as we can because the twins arent going away and you never know about detroit
2253370 i love the pga championship and i hate to not be continuing
2253371 but i have got to get ready for the ryder cup
2253372 i have had lasik surgery and have been wearing lasik lenses which have a hard center and flatten out at the end
2253373 i had got some infection in there and my doctor said that i needed to let my eyes rest by keeping the contacts out
2253374 all of whom are in it for the right reasons from jim caviezel and john hurt to sophia myles jack huston and ron perlman they all liked the script not because it was a monster movie not because it was a genre movie but because of the underlying story
2253375 sophia myles was ideal for freya because she brought a sense of grit and edge and she inhabited this historical world well i had seen tristan and isolde and loved sophias performance
2253376 its curious how i seem to get offered a lot of royalty
2253377 but freyas different she gets her hands dirty she gets to fight the moorwen which delighted me when i read that in the script shes more masculine than any other character ive played and that i get to deck jim with a roundhouse is impressive but then again im surrounded by so much testosterone in this film the boys are great jack has become my best friend jim has been great showing me up all the time with his push ups and then there is john hurt just to be in the same room with him is a privilege
2253378 howard has been fantastic we instantly connected he sees the vision and he knows what he wants its been a mud bath at times but the harder it is on the day the better it looks on the screen so i was prepared to put up with all the muck
2253379 ron perlman is just the epitome of cool sophia is a sweetheart and jim is a great actor with an amazing intensity which is perfect for the character
2253380 hey alyssa look over here he isnt what you thought
2253381 ive noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born themselves

2253388 robbie coltrane is not the burglar but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
2253389 this is a picture of english actor robbie coltrane who you may remember from the harry potter films or the award winning british drama cracker
2253390 because of the children and young persons act 1989 police cannot show you a picture of the 16 year old burglar operating in your neighbourhood
2253391 he is 16 years old lives locally travels by bicycle and burgles houses in your street
2253392 he will break windows to gain entry and ransack the property targeting electronic items cash and jewellery
2253393 part of this is that there was too much money coming in people who wanted to be in the glamorous film business and partly because everybody was hoping on new media
2253394 a few years ago i was talking to various people who were saying people have so much money that they want to invest in hollywood films we dont know what to do with it
2253395 im thinking the result is there are too many movies for example last year there were 747 movies released in the united states thats an average of two movies a day its too many
2253396 theres no way that all of those movies are going to make money
2253397 so i think hollywoods going to cut back and get a little smarter on how they market things
2253398 george lucas wrote the rules way back in the late 70s and basically he leased his star wars movies to fox fox released it they got a distribution fee but he owns that property
2253399 you have to be in a real superstar category steven spielberg george lucas to get those kind of terms
2253400 its going to be necessary because it is getting more and more expensive
2253401 with that said its kind of a shame because the beauty of what were doing here is we have the unique opportunity of one vision
2253402 can we go out and play to win the game if its silky soccer great
2253403 if its skelp it up the park and chase it great as long as we win
2253404 im a great believer that its what we do that matters
2253405 its cat and mouse but youve got to be organised and if youre organised it doesnt matter what system and what players they throw at you
2253406 lets get off with a win thats what we want we want that first win under our belts
2253407 from the prequel i am not working on but that was fun
2253408 this will be one of the greatest scientific experiments as well as the most expensive ever conducted on earth which fingers crossed will reveal truths about existence guessed at but never demonstrated
2253409 im setting a 25 goal target and hopefully ill get to 15 before christmas
2253410 been good for me on a personal basis because strikers go on goals and if you have a good pre season you set yourself up for a good campaign
2253411 im a confidence player so scoring goals and especially against good sides like fenerbahce steaua bucharest and portsmouth is good for me
2253412 fenerbahce had roberto carlos playing at left back alex in central midfield and mateja kezman up front so its not as if it was their reserve side they had a strong side out and we did really well
2253413 im not one of those players who sits around and picks up a pay cheque every week
2253414 im not happy if i am not playing so i had to get out of reading to play football and further my own career
2253415 if i could have done it at reading i would have stayed but the chances were very limited so i had to leave and play regular first team football

2253501 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2253502 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2253503 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2253504 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2253505 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2253506 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2253507 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2253508 the united states should not be an atm for the iraqi government
2253509 ich bin mir der tatsache bewusst dass nicht jede resolution umgesetzt wird ich bin mir der schwierigkeiten bewusst und trotz all dem sage ich mit v lliger zuversicht dass die resolution des sicherheitsrats gut ist f r israel
2253510 es ist wichtig zu erkl ren das wir von anfang an verstanden haben dass diese ziele tats chlich durch politische mittel erreicht werden m ssen und weil es f r uns offensichtlich war dass die gesamte internationale gemeinschaft die ursache der j ngsten zwischenf lle begriffen hat und dass es notwendig war die resolution 1559 umzusetzen haben wir selbst gehandelt um die verfahrensweisen und resolutionen zu initiieren die die ziele voran bringen die wir uns gesetzt haben
2253511 und in der annahme dass sie umgesetzt wird verglichen mit der lage die vorher existierte k nnte sie eine dramatische ver nderung im s dlichen libanon schaffen
2253512 selbst in den letzten stunden vor der verabschiedung der resolution wollten wir sicher stellen dass dieses embargo durchsetzbar und mit substanz ist um die lieferung von waffen aus diesen l ndern an die hisbollah oder sonst jemanden au er der libanesischen armee zu verhindern
2253513 und es ist wichtig zu sagen dass auf die eine oder andere weise
2253514 es ist gefragt worden ob jetzt alles von entscheidungen oder w nschen der libanesischen regierung in bezug auf die internationalen streitkr fte abh ngt aus unserer sicht ist jeder gesamtprozess der die bergabe von macht in die h nde er libanesischen regierung beinhaltet damit diese ihre souver nit t durchsetzen kann ein positiver der nat rlich einen echten wandeln der lage im libanon schafft
2253515 es ist auch klar dass der gesamte prozess letztlich zur entwaffnung der hisbollah f hren soll dass also die libanesische armee nicht nur nach s den vorr ckt nicht nur ein embargo sondern ein prozess der durch die entwaffnung der hisbollah vollendet wird wie es von anfang an in den fr heren resolutionen verlangt wurde aber heute machen wir den weg frei diesen prozess auf einer praktizierbaren ebene zu schaffen
2253516 bez glich der internationalen streitkr fte sollte offenbar werden dass die streitkr fte ber die entschieden wurden nicht ausreichen er ffnet die resolution den weg der es erlauben wird das mandat zu verbessern und eine angemessene streitmacht zu schaffen die effektiver sein wird und ein weiter gefasstes mandat als dieses haben wird dies ist in der resolution bereits festgelegt
2253517 in meiner einsch tzung besonders wegen der ereignisse des vergangenen monates wird die internationale gemeinschaft wie auch die libanesische regierung verstehen dass israel nicht l nger eine lage akzeptiert in der eine terror organisation an seiner grenze sitzt und katjuschas auf israelische b rger schie t oder alternativ israelische soldaten angreift wo immer sie will wir haben die meisten ziele der israelischen initiative erreicht die wir praktisch als ersten entwurf auf den tisch der internationalen gemeinschaft legten
2253518 i remain absolutely opposed to the mta sales tax measure and i plan to spend my time and effort campaigning against it
2253519 the plan is not equitable for all county residents and this is the wrong time to burden people with even higher taxes
2253520 playing games with the election process would have cost the taxpayers millions and disenfranchised thousands of voters
2253521 we are appreciative of supervisor knabes willingness to ask for reconsideration on this matter
2253522 however to preserve all of our options we are moving forward with legal action and plan to be in court tomorrow
2253523 she feels very strongly that her abstention very accurately reflected how she felt about the entire issue
2253524 shes not opposed in principle to a tax increase for public transportation but the foundation for this measure was fundamentally flawed
2253525 it will lead to what will appear like an uprising against the palestinian authority in the west bank
2253526 if arrests continue they will lead to unforeseen responses whether from resistance fighters or the people
2253527 if they can do anything let them do it we are not afraid

2253529 we had an incredible crop of say 60 varieties of tomatoes
2253530 at that time nobody was growing that kind of variety so it really caught the eye of restaurants and a lot of customers i was really lucky if wed had a dry year like this year in that first year because i had no irrigation i wouldnt be here id be back in brooklyn thinking of my next scheme
2253531 if you want to be a restaurant that counts you got to have some filthy farmer walking in with something just picked
2253532 i think the switchboard at the capitol is melting quite frankly you know i went home to the state fair and went to the ham breakfast which starts at 6 a m there were 300 farmers from all 92 counties of there was no mention made from the podium about our protest but i stood up and simply said its an honor to be here with the governor and the lieutenant governor and i said quite frankly its just nice to be speaking where the lights are on and it brought the house down people from all 92 counties
2253533 i was talking to our leader ohio republican john boehner later in the day and he was as struck with that as i was
2253534 this is reaching the american people whether nbc cbs abc decide to do much with it im not interested
2253535 the new media much of which is gathered around this table and cable television media and talk radio has taken this to the country
2253536 i just think we got to right now focus that enormous energy across the country
2253537 i think if sen mccain were to say somewhere on the campaign trail that the republicans who are having this these ad hoc meetings in the house are trying to force a vote on an energy bill that will help the american people get their gas prices down i think that would be a real plus for him and i think it would put enormous pressure additional pressure on speaker of the house nancy pelosi
2253538 i do think we need to do more than just what were doing here you know whats interesting is when you go out into statuary hall in the rotunda and you invite people to come on the floor theyre so excited to come in and not just witness it based on a sound clip that the media happens to put up they can actually see and hear whats going on
2253539 and so you know i think we need to go out certainly continue what were doing on the floor
2253540 its my hope that we will continue doing it throughout the entire break but we need to go out into the districts out into the country and regional areas and hold town hall meetings or field hearings if we can and make sure this word actually gets into the homes of some of those people that are refusing to come back up here

2253549 we have to take away the positives from that game and move on i have confidence in this team and know well bounce back
2253550 norway lost in the first game in 2000 and came back and won in the final
2253551 we just have to take care of business and have great games against japan and new zealand we believe we can do it

2253583 hoe je het ook noemt pedofilie is verboden bij de nederlandse wet
2253584 h wat is hier nou aan de hand waarom staat dit hier
2253585 nou ik ben ook zwaar tegen het goedpraten van pedofilie waarom omdat de persoon in kwestie zo nooit tot het besef komt dat hij zij een probleem heeft dit kan er toe lijden dat de persoon uiteindelijk in de fout gaat omdat hij zij vaak te horen krijgt dat het niet erg is en niet fout is dat iemand een seksuele voorkeur heeft daar kan hij zij niets aan doen maar als het om pedofilie gaat een voorkeur voor kinderen moet duidelijk zijn dat de persoon toch echt een grote beperking heeft hier zal die persoon uiteindelijk en snel mee moeten leren omgaan
2253586 geloof je het zelf dat een pedo geen seks wil met een kind
2253587 erkennen dat ze niets met hun gevoelens mogen en kunnen doen
2253588 erkennen dat ze niets met hun gevoelens mogen en kunnen doen
2253589 je hebt je aardig laten manipulen geef niet is mij ook zo vaak overkomen maar moet je nagaan ze weten ook nog eens exact waar ze mee bezig zijn
2253590 voor de meeste daders is precies dit juist de lol die ze eraan ervaren een mensenleven stuk maken wat een macht
2253591 rekening houdend met een anti sociaal persoonlijkheidsstoornis ik weet niet wie jij denk dat ik ben hoor springbok maar ik ken de trucjes die deze mensen gebruiken vertel mij niets
2253592 dus jij denkt werkelijk dat ze niet op die partij zullen stemmen
2253593 wel of geen pedo de gevolgen blijven net zo erg en ik heb de indruk dat je pedofilie goed zit te praten
2253594 zijn zich bewust van de gevolgen van misbruik voor het kind zoals je zegt dus als er 1 is die zijn bedwang niet kan inhouden doet hij dat met willens en wetens net zo erg dus
2253595 dus niet mensen met sadistische neigingen nee het kind wilde het zelf
2253596 en voor degenen die benieuwd zijn naar mijn persoonlijke mening indien deze man ontucht heeft gepleegt nu of in het verleden dan dient hij niet alleen uit de wijk te worden gezet maar ook uit de samenleving indien deze man geheel onschuldig is dan dienen alle mensen die de petitie getekent hebben in mijn ogen een schadevergoeding te betalen aan deze man wegens smaad en of deze man schuldig is of niet tja dat weet ik ook niet want ik ken hem niet dus dat laat ik over aan justitie
2253597 gho toch apart dat ik therapeuten meer vertouw dan jij mijn therapueten hebben allen stuk voor stuk uitgelegt wat er mankeerd in het hoofd van zo iemand conclussie was antisociaal
2253598 ik ben een slachtoffer van 1 van hen soort dus ja ik weet hoe ze zijn en ze hebben meerdere gezichten
2253599 jouw definitie van pedofilie deugt niet en ik heb je zojuist uitgelegd waar ze niet deugt ow dus een pedo misbruikt een kind niet dat doet alleen maar een sadist
2253600 en neemt ook niet weg dat pedofiele misbruikers wel degelijk bestaan en dat ze kinderen traumatiseren en eveneens gruwelijke mensen zijn
2253601 tja weet je wat ik vind deze persoon zegt eigenlijk hiermee dat er dus een eerste slachtoffer mag vallen en dat is naar mijn mening al veel te veel er moet eerst bewezen worden dat hij een gevaar is tja dan is het toch al te laat niet waar en dit soort zinnen is dus wat ik bedoel blijf er met je volle verstand bij met wat ze zeggen want je tuint er zo in

2253603 our job wasnt to ask what the point was if that had been our job nothing articulated to prospective clients in our capabilities brochure and our website would have escaped our rolled eyes the point of another billboard outside ohare another mailer on your kitchen table good luck mustering an argument for more of that glut if we had to call into question the point wed have fallen into an existential crisis that would have quickly led us to question the entire american enterprise we had to keep telling ourselves to forget about the point and keep our noses down and focus on the fractured and isolated task at hand

2253605 the guy that is playing well for us right now is bo dyer he is a freshman and is playing consistently for us we need to give these young guys the reps so we can see who is going to step up and be the no 2 or 3 tailback
2253606 he is a veteran he has to lead this group and carry the load for us when we talk about him separating himself from the pack we talk about him being an all conference back carrying the ball 30 times a game taking the pounding and being able to protect and being good in our flare patrol
2253607 he can protect when he wants to we have to get him to run with lower pad level and protect the football he has to protect the football and learn how to use his strength and power is talented he has a lot of good skill sets he has a bright future in this program he has been injured dyer a walk on is a tough kid he is running the ball well for us right now and doing a good job

2253619 i think the world of him as a person and as a coach he knows how much respect i have for him and how much leeway i give him i listen to his ideas and he listens to mine thats why we work well together thats why i wanted him with me
2253620 if you do the best you can and be the best you can be the opportunities are going to come
2253621 thats why i was recognized by wade in san diego but just as an artist who paints a picture its somebody else who says its a masterpiece i am trying to paint a picture with these players its for somebody else to say brian stewart is a good coach
2253622 save time and money by creating pdf documents from any program
2253623 the donations are basically through and through illegal thats number one and number two is how the obama campaign tried to conceal it
2253624 they listed the campaign contributions as coming from rafah georgia they used the ga from gaza so it makes it look like its legal and then for the zip code it says 972 which is actually the area code to dial over to gaza
2253625 accept thousands of dollars beyond the legal limit and theyre also going to flout federal election commission restrictions thats very indicative of what kind of president obama is going to be
2253626 theyre not going to be worried about the details and they wont mind if they break the law to get to the final result that they want
2253627 major news story when a presidential candidate receives money from a bastion of islamic terrorism
2253628 bending over backwards to help barack obama and cover up any negative news about him
2253629 the dollar is in my view in a genuine recovery this trend could run much further than many think
2253630 this is a major reassessment in a very short period of time the sentiment turned 180 degrees
2253631 the market now believes that the us economy once again will be able to leave a crisis behind very quickly thats why we see the dollar rising like a phoenix
2253632 when ms karen hughes was appointed as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs she set the tone to continue a disastrous policy of outreach with islamist partners

2253646 thus what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemys strategy
2253647 weve obviously had a good pre season performances and results have been ok and everybodys fit and well for the start of the season so were delighted at the moment
2253648 the tactical team is finished and its a closed deal but remember that weve been through this before and every time we close a deal its reopened
2253649 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2253650 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2253651 this complaint reveals the clear advantages of coming to the pcc with complaints of privacy intrusion
2253652 the process has been quick the final settlement was negotiated less than 36 hours after the original complaint was made
2253653 in contrast with some legal actions it has involved no further private details which in this case could have related to prince philips health being released into the public domain

2253655 we would prefer to retain psb status but not at any price
2253656 ofcom understands our predicament but does not quite understand the urgency never mind next year we could do with it next month there is an important connection between the goodwill impairment and the psb review
2253657 it is unarguable now that ofcom needs to take quick action to redress the imbalance between the value of the licence and that which we are required to provide
2253658 if this was a one month blip they wouldnt act this quickly to lower the dividend and take a goodwill impairment
2253659 the pace of deterioration and halving the dividend highlight that this is not hot air from michael grade and shows how urgently itv needs the process to go through
2253660 itv is outperforming commercial rivals and ad revenues are flat which is pretty good given the markets overall decline michael grade is trying to make a silk purse out of a sows ear
2253661 shame on lor al for doing this i see no excuse for this if it was uneven skin tone then they just as easily could have made her a tone darker but they did not do that they made her white
2253662 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowless features or skin tone in the campaign for f ria hair colour
2253663 we know that this is fairly common practice but that doesnt make it excusable
2253664 this sort of thing creates a negative perception of african beauty
2253665 for all the talk of black is beautiful images like this clearly show that weve got a very long way to go yet
2253666 all i know is that beyonc looks remarkably beautiful on that we do not get involved in the colouring of adverts that appear in the magazine that is a matter for lor al
2253667 we believe any such modifications could suggest the view that black is not beautiful we believe that all people should be celebrated as they are
2253668 wombats are being shot on the kings highway between canberra and braidwood either by land owners or thrillseekers using the protected species for target practice some shooters are even cutting off the wombats ears to take as a trophy ten wombats were found dead beside the highway in a 25km stretch south of braidwood this week
2253669 some of the wombats would have been hit by vehicles but at least two looked to have been shot their heads crushed and their ears missing another three wombats had been shot on the majors creek road
2253670 forensic veterinary skills of the braidwood constabulary looked to be shot is far from a definitive enough description to warrant publishing wild speculation about supposed
2253671 typical false information coming from people with a personal agenda
2253672 hear gun shots most weekends be it day or night
2253673 hats off to the efforts of the police in trying to maintain the law with appropriate respect to all parties they have a difficult job managing an extended jurisdiction including the notorious kings highway and the more remote areas where illegal shooting is allegedly rife
2253674 the kings hwy is the badlands of se australia and police need to respond accordingly
2253675 most interesting of all is the fact that this last 3 5 months is the first time in over 20 years of travelling daily to canberra that we have seen 2 3 wombats together actually touching each other one might almost assume that in a very few cases they have been dumped after being killed
2253676 theres one bloke who bragged to me just a couple of nights ago that he was disappointed he hadnt quite got to a thousand this year
2253677 humanely dispatched by a land owner etc after being hit by a vehicle
2253678 if you have children having a visual record of everything your child does will help you to make sure they are not communicating with someone they shouldnt be or falling victim to or acting as a cyberbully
2253679 but for parents and adults in general having a visual record of all the activity on your computer is not such a bad idea
2253680 if that means getting confirmation numbers you forgot to write down or safely finding a website that corrupted your machine everything will be there
2253681 there is lot that others can do to your pc on purpose or by accident that can have an effect on its performance and on your safety if the wrong files get deleted you can have a seriously corrupted system even worse if the wrong setting is changed or the wrong files deleted you could find yourself locked out of your own bank account or even have your private passwords and personal information opened up to anyone that cares to look if you have a record of everything that happened you can isolate the problem and have a better shot at rectifying it

2253697 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game

2253702 if the pin was easier you might have saw a bit more of that but where they put the pin its pretty much impossible you have to try to get up where you can chip on
2253703 just because its a shorter hole doesnt make it a great hole
2253704 you always very much like to have a drivable par 4 especially around 14 or 15 late in the round

2253716 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2253717 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had
2253718 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport

2253720 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2253721 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2253722 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2253723 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page

2253770 we started back in 2003 and each year we give away about two hundred backpacks so this year will bring us to over 1 000 backpacks and what we do is we donate them to kids living in local shelters
2253771 i think that makes a big difference to bring that full circle so they can see how the teens are living and how its different from what their lifestyles are

2253793 hello democratic leaders your constituents are talking to you why arent you listening what is wrong with you
2253794 but this is in regard to the extended warranty you have on your carpet cleaner
2253795 the greens are a little crazy theres a lot of swales out there that you have to figure out and not short side yourself youve got to think a lot
2253796 this ones a little more frustrating for me im two time defending champ and not being able to get out there and defend something ive already defended once and cant do it twice its a little bit frustrating
2253797 this golf course is set up more like what a u s open was set up like three or four years ago where missing a fairway by a couple yards is like missing it by 10 yards
2253798 this is a tougher test in those terms a more intimidating test and more punishing in that sense
2253799 i am glad i brought this course this monster to its knees
2253800 its a great golf course but its probably the toughest pga ive ever played
2253801 it will help us grab more market share and start an outside us marketing activity

2253805 our lawn furniture the swing set was floating floating like four and a half feet of water above our fence
2253806 they turned the electricity off so i was kicking around trying to find something and figure out in a real quick fashion if it was valuable or not something i should pull off to dry land or not
2253807 the fire department came and said you probably shouldnt be in here so then i just went in packing stuff for the kids and passing my husband trying to keep calm and thinking do i pack our wedding album or do i just pack enough clothes for the night is our house going to blow up
2253808 as far as clean up just piece by piece i guess
2253809 were working with state government and local planning units to look at our challenges as well as challenges up and down the hudson river in other cities
2253810 the scope and breadth of people we interact with arent as big as we think they are
2253811 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2253812 we do not want any democrat either in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying well you know im just not satisfied im not happy
2253813 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2253814 the refusal to publicly announce her intentions is widely seen as a bargaining chip clinton is holding on to as party officials negotiate logistics regarding her convention speech and other activities
2253815 at this point it is as likely as not that clinton will be formally nominated at the convention individuals close to the negotiations said
2253816 officials have firmly denied a report last week that clinton had decided not to have her name put into the record advisers on both sides also said that relations between the two are improving

2253826 the international space station transits occur every 90 minutes but this was one of the better transits the sun was at the right angle and things were just about perfect for observation
2253827 on any clear night you can see one or two meteors an hour its quite common to see a meteor pass through the sky
2253828 i enjoy watching the night sky for meteor showers and aurora events and ill watch the sky when the iss passes over
2253829 depending on when you see the iss there are many variables that affect the brightness of the station probably the main factor is the relative position of the sun sometimes it looks like a faint star other times it looks like a very bright planet the bolide that vaporized in the night sky on aug 3 was brighter than the moon the bolide could not be confused for the iss the only way the iss would like like what i saw is if it reentered the atmosphere

2253859 has been marred by a well documented surge in violations of the rights of free expression and association as well as media freedom in addition abuses of migrant construction workers who were pivotal to beijings infrastructure improvements have increased as have evictions of beijing residents whose homes were demolished to make way for that infrastructure
2253860 crackdown on human rights defenders journalists and lawyers has intensified because beijing is hosting the olympics the authorities have stepped up repression of dissident voices in their efforts to present an image of stability and harmony to the outside world
2253861 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists

2253865 obamas political calculation may be correct but it still involves a price it has shattered his claim to be different it calls into question his political character and leaves the impression he is consumed and defined by ambition
2253866 in the same breath that theyre said to be apolitical theyre said to be a celebration of human rights and theyre said to be a sporting festival we hope that can transcend mere sporting festivals
2253867 i think when we talk about the crisis in darfur we talk about the millions of innocent people that are suffering there and we talk about the positive role that china could play should they choose to and the rest of the international community i mean these people have been failed i think at every level
2253868 chinese authorities have in the past cracked down prior to big international events
2253869 whatever else may be thought about hitlers exploits they are among the most remarkable in the whole history of the world
2253870 eighty six percent of chinese people surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
2253871 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends

2253925 as a normative way of socializing for gay men online cruising is a disaster we need to recognize its effects including its tendency to isolate us encourage objectification and diminish our sense of lifes nonsexual possibilities as disasters we need to recognize that too many of us too much of the time are cruising online because it is easier and feels safer than thinking about the love we are missing and the power we do not have too many of us too much of the time are cruising online because its easier and feels safer than mustering the courage patience discipline and imagination required to help ourselves and each other become the men that in our strongest moments we want to be

2253967 el banco de la provincia de corrientes el 24 de marzo de 1976 era un banco con super vit con todo lo que significa haber sido un banco el estado gerenciado por los gobernadores de entonces que tampoco eran ni os de pecho a la saz n era julio romero el que gobernaba que era peronista entre comillas de todas maneras cuando viene el golpe el banco tiene super vit en dictadura empieza a dar cr ditos a los grandes productores de la provincia o grandes tenedores de tierras y homologando el procedimiento nacional de perd n de la deuda externa privada y la estatizaci n de la deuda tambi n ac se perdona la deuda privada y se la hace p blica de manera que todos aquellos grandes estancieros de apellidos notables de la provincia quedan enriquecidos por este pr stamo y nosotros cargamos con la deuda
2253968 hubo mucha complicidad pol tica porque los posteriores gobernantes que a n hoy siguen en la palestra fueron funcionarios de los gobiernos militares embajadores en el extranjero la cara fina de los milicos en el extranjero eran estos ricos correntinos que son muy paquetes que hist ricamente se han ligado con los extranjeros siempre han sido intendentes embajadores navaja artaza que fue funcionario de la dictadura autor de la ley de autoamnist a por lo que queda claro que hay una estrecha vinculaci n

2253973 amazing show with lots of pyro gallons of blood live crucifixion and nude models
2253974 producers metal mind productions bought the sheep heads at a butcher shop we werent involved in animal torture of any kind
2253975 we didnt plan to really have an outcome like that our only intent was to go there and film the dvd all the chaos and media reaction that came from this was a surprise of sorts
2253976 not worried really i mean what was the worst thing they could do destroy the tapes i dont think they would do that and i dont think they could really do any harm to us though they might be able to put the polish producer away in prison for a few years for us this will probably help us sell a few more records as of now i can only think that the dvd will be put out eventually it would be almost like they are stuck in the middle ages in poland if they destroyed the tapes by burning them i hope to get them back one day i hope
2253977 i will honestly say that i have no idea if trustkill bleeding through s u s record label will give us the money they said they would to make a video as we are still waiting on a lot of other things from them i doubt we will actually make a video anytime soon unless we pay for it ourselves if there is a miracle and miracles sometimes do happen we will get some money and we record a video and it will be done in september
2253978 i think it bridges the gap between 2006s the truth and 2003s this is love this is murderous
2253979 the melodies are darker the riffs are heavier we just wrote a really aggressive record that encompasses everything weve ever tried to do as a band and then raised the bar a notch or two
2253980 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2253981 tskhinvali and the heights around tskhinvali and the majority of the villages in south ossetia are under the control of georgian forces
2253982 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2253983 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2253984 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2253985 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2253986 about 1400 died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
2253987 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate ceasefire
2253988 i am deeply concerned over the dramatic situation in georgia and i deplore the loss of human lives and the suffering inflicted on the civilian population
2253989 the only possible way out is the withdrawal of georgian forces to starting positions
2253990 n s estamos aproveitando aquilo que ningu m aproveita o direito de imagem no meio do futebol ele um pouco diferente dos outros uma pessoa que entende as dificuldades do clube temos a certeza de que a pessoa ideal para usarmos o direito de imagem

2253993 tudo o que a espanha est fazendo de bom na rea esportiva significa que estamos passando por uma onda favor vel e que pode dar impulso candidatura de madri
2253994 repetir o sucesso dos jogos de barcelona em 1992 ser dif cil porque daquela vez t nhamos o fator espa o e desde ent o a competitividade de outros pa ses aumentou muito
2253995 teremos bom desempenho aqui e em londres depois em 2016 ser um triunfo porque levaremos as olimp adas para madri
2253996 i know teams think now they can come out and start throwing punches and put us off our game but i think this footy team can adapt to any style of play and thats what were proud of bellamy said
2253997 over the last couple of weeks every week someone comes up and says theres going to be a punch up this week and headbutt competition or whatever
2253998 but at the end of the day if they want to turn the lights off and go down the back alley im sure well be able to handle that as well
2253999 but we want to play footy and as i said i think we can adapt to any style of play and get the job done it wasnt that pretty tonight but it was gutsy and i was really proud of them
2254000 certainly after the dragons game i think every game since then have tried to come out and bash us a bit smith said
2254001 but although you can go out and do that at the start its pretty hard to do that for 80 minutes so once the juice runs out thats when we try to capitalise
2254002 no i thought we tackled and defended with a lot of intensity i just thought we defended really well hasler said
2254003 sonny had significant input into masons departure from the club
2254004 sonny knows what i mean mason may not i can assure you he williams was part of that process he had input into his leaving
2254005 i hadnt considered that until i heard that last night who knows
2254006 i think people would have a lot more respect for him if he just came out and said look im just doing it for the money because thats the only thing i can see
2254007 maybe some of the players relaxed just a little bit failing to appreciate that the all blacks would come at them even more strongly in light of their setback in the first game
2254008 if so and only each individual would really know the answer to how the circumstances impacted on their performance i know as a group we will have learned much from the experience
2254009 as far as our progress as a team goes the auckland experience was a setback but it need not be any more than that
2254010 i would like to think the reverse wont impact too greatly on the confidence that has been built up within the group but that is something well really only be able to judge retrospectively
2254011 thats the challenge that lies ahead for the men of gold
2254012 it is one i am confident the team is up for as we assemble next wednesday ahead of one of the greatest quests that exists in world rugby the challenge of winning test matches on south african soil
2254013 getting on the front foot there allowed new zealand to dictate much of the game through the tactical nous of dan carter
2254014 we then compounded the problem with some of our decision making under pressure
2254015 it didnt always come off but the approach said a lot about their positive attitude
2254016 those qualities and habits should stand them in good stead as we further build the team and develop our game
2254017 you will apologize in person in full view of her and not on the phone
2254018 there have been numerous attempts to distract the game from the fundamental issue which is that a contract is a binding commitment on the part of both the player and the club
2254019 it protects both parties and places responsibilities on both parties the issuing of a nsw supreme court order in respect of those responsibilities should provide a stark reminder to sonny bill of the importance of him observing the terms of his contract
2254020 it is a very serious matter for such an order to be granted and anyone who breaks an order of the nsw supreme court would face contempt proceedings from that court
2254021 the rules relating to that are really complicated and require a court in france to enforce a judgment in sydney will have to go through loads of hoops to make sure that works
2254022 the australians will find it quite difficult to get an injunction and stop him playing in france this weekend
2254023 the french courts may take the view that enforcing the injunction would be against french public policy as it prevents a person from carrying on their trade
2254024 he is as free to play rugby and at rct rugby club toulon as he is to come from football or pole vaulting
2254025 we havent mentioned it yet but well definitely look at it and talk about it at tonights meeting at the hotel
2254026 i think everyones aware of how good they are finishing games and last time they charged us down from six goals behind so were going to be aware of that but we think weve improved our second halves since the middle of the year and hopefully were ahead at three quarter time and can hold on
2254027 round 11 probably sticks in the players minds and i think also carlton have got a fair bit on it trying to play for finals so you add those together and hopefully our guys respond pretty well
2254028 it doesnt mean the end for those guys who come out we mainly want to see mitch farmer play down back fabian deluca in the ruck and nick salter up forward and we think thats exciting
2254029 tobys pretty critical to our backline its a matter of looking at damon white and bentley and lonie weve seen what theyve done over the last four weeks and theyll probably get another crack before the end of the year and well decide what happens after that
2254030 white has got four weeks to show us if hes a backman or a forward if he can play both it would be great
2254031 i dont think its right hes been sacked from his club but i dont see why they should make him unemployable in australia riolo said
2254032 i thought the nrl would be trying to keep quality players and work with players in our game rather than sending them out to siberia on penance
2254033 if youre sacked from any job youre not being made unemployable in the whole industry and he hasnt committed a crime
2254034 canberra has chosen to sack him and thats their prerogative and theyve got grounds to do that under the playing contract between todd and the club
2254035 but that shouldnt really to me have anything to do with him being employed by anybody else
2254036 the nrl are saying they wont register his contract but i dont know if thats really fair riolo said
2254037 ill be looking in to that but again we dont want to get into a legal situation
2254038 that probably wouldnt help the nrl or todd or anyone but i wouldnt mind to clarify on what ground he would be de registered
2254039 i would assume the sacking was punishment enough rodwell told abc online
2254040 without a doubt the club did not want to see carney playing against us in 2009 club chief executive don furner said
2254041 well before all of this i was talking to monaghans mother and father at games and jokingly saying it would be great to see michael playing alongside joel the raiders chief executive told sydney radio 2ky
2254042 at that time he was homesick and we joked about it with them
2254043 good girls just did not do this sort of thing

2254050 amfar is a prestigious organization to get funding from if you do hiv research so its a big testament to the work were doing
2254051 we hope that it will help us reach latinos who are at risk for hiv and improve the outcomes for hiv positive latinos so they are not affected disproportionately
2254052 latinos generally do not go to the doctor to get tested to see if they are infected with hiv until they are very very sick
2254053 and once diagnosed they dont take their medicine as prescribed even when they have access to life extending medicines
2254054 there are a number of different things that are affecting the attitudes and opinions toward medicine of the latino community this study will give us a sense of all the variables that are affecting the trust or mistrust of medicine

2254075 considerable progress was made at the companys 100 owned majors creek gold project in nsw diamond and rc drilling of extensions to the dargues reef deposit continued to return robust grades and widths that extended the strike length further east and appear to be improving the ounces per vertical metre component
2254076 scoping studies into the mining potential of dargues commenced with excellent gold recoveries reported from initial metallurgical test work
2254077 the company now has unrestricted access to proposed drill sites at dargues this right of entry will greatly enhance the ability to target the resource and position drilling rigs on any location within the lease ownership of the land will also allow for greater flexibility when planning for infrastructure
2254078 the on going drilling programme continues to return significant grades and mineable widths of mineralisation from the dargues reef deposit the deeper diamond drilling has recently finished and results are pending
2254079 this is a conceptual test of the companys developing exploration model and has the potential to open up the prospectivity of the entire project area

2254227 ich glaube dass bei der herrschenden weltlage geschichten aus ihrer tell me reihe sehr wichtig sind es ist meine hoffnung und mein wunsch dass diese b cher auch von nichtmuslimen gelesen werden und genauso popul r werden wie herk mmliche kinderb cher

2254253 this is not a finished action this is not a done deal by any means
2254254 although it would be one commander in charge of both missions the missions would not be blended in any way

2254256 so youve got u s forces that are not all under the command of a single u s officer in afghanistan

2254267 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever human embryonic stem cells will remain to be very useful tools whether were going to figure out how to do this without viruses so they can be used therapeutically remains an open question
2254268 we are pleased to see external experts recognising the strength of our surveillance systems on healthcare associated infection and suggesting that other boards might like to put similar arrangements in place
2254269 we already comply with the recommendations made and will work with the scottish government on any new developments for instance we already have computerised tracking systems to detect cases and we already review severe cases to see where lessons can be learned
2254270 in general all who have served in afghanistan speak about an escalation of problems and an increase in the number of attacks on allied forces it will be more and more difficult to maintain the mission in its current state

2254287 are basically acknowledging the slow institutionalization of a phenomenon that has gradually begun of course there are aspects that are involved here including the attribution to changing
2254288 ive taught my son not to start a fight but to defend himself if he is attacked
2254289 i understand what you say but he was involved in a fight he should have made the decision to walk away after being hit

2254305 oh well i guess weve done all we can do here watch her closer
2254306 this is really good you wrote three paragraphs and didnt say anything
2254307 since then the post has supported veterans their families and the community we also provide a club for veterans to come to relax and enjoy themselves they have earned it
2254308 the building we own is 100 years old and it shows we have undertaken a fundraising effort to replace this building
2254309 with the new set of veterans coming home we need a proper place that will last another 100 years
2254310 the system used there contains ideas that may be helpful in improving access and quality of care here in maine
2254311 what weve accomplished is pretty spectacular i want people out there who are over the age of 23 to stop and reflect on what they were doing at our age because what have you accomplished i know zack ryder and i are 23 years old and were already wwe tag team champions
2254312 curt and i delivered everyone who said we couldnt do it we proved them wrong like curt said were only 23 years old and we won the gold
2254313 while we were making history i looked out into the crowd at nassau coliseum i saw people i went to high school with
2254314 i remember way back when my cousins and brother got me into wrestling
2254315 it was such a fantasy to me you just see it on television
2254316 i wanted to be a girly girl back then and my mom always me to have short hair and be more tomboyish
2254317 it was a battle i felt sorry for my mom because i was the only other girl in the family and nobody knew how to give her advice on how to take care of a little girl
2254318 i always wanted to be a ballerina my mom used to tell me that if she took me to the movies i would be so uninterested but if she took me to the ballet i wouldnt even move
2254319 you cant beat the rush you get when theres tens of thousands of people watching you
2254320 its such a rush i dont think youll be able to find that anywhere else just knowing that somebody is coming and paying to see your show and youre the highlight of their day its the most rewarding feeling in the world
2254321 i really look forward to stepping into the ring i got the opportunity with layla and it was great i would love to just show my stuff ive always been a physical person and i just want to translate that in the ring so look for me soon
2254322 being my size as a strongman and an athlete in general it takes hard work for the olympics and other competitions i engaged in the training was long
2254323 for the games my training started at nine in the morning and ended at four in the afternoon
2254324 i was young so there was also school mixed in i had to eat three or four times a day and get therapy on my body
2254325 i travel so much in wwe with wrestling we are constantly on and off planes exercising in the arenas conditioning when we can its just as tough but in a different way
2254326 the olympics put an incredible amount of pressure on an athlete
2254327 in wwe we do 250 somewhat shows a year of course i get a rush much more often now but the olympics come around every four years and you only have four or five competitions a year so theres really a lot of pressure to prove oneself in a short time but also a lot of stimulation
2254328 i have been very lucky in my life and i plan to hold my place at the top in wwe for a long time to come
2254329 competition drives me that is also why i think when the time comes for me to retire from wrestling would like to be a part of the olympics again
2254330 theres a lot of talent especially young talent competing in the games nowadays and i would like to help them i see myself as an olympic critic i want to see those kids treated fairly so the political side is where i am headed next i think
2254331 we were in hershey and i wanted to go to the park we rode eight roller coasters we closed that park down im telling you it was like i was a little kid i was so excited to go on the rides it was so refreshing
2254332 it was so much fun it was totally awesome it made me feel like a little kid again
2254333 there were lots of chocolate concession stands vending machines and giant hershey bars and reeses peanut butter cup dancing guys who came out which was hilarious it was fun
2254334 i think what ill remember most is spending time with everybody and getting to see something different and making the best out of the day off
2254335 one thing i would like to add is that i was a competitive powerlifter thats one thing id like the wwe universe to know about my athletic background
2254336 ecw doesnt really show how much of a cheerleader i am or how bubbly i am that would be the word
2254337 also i was an athlete only some people actually consider cheerleading an athletic sport i was always the girl who like flew up in the air id have five guys underneath me whod basket toss me and throw me up in the air
2254338 she gave me a gift certificate to the spa and a salon to have a total spa treatment and to get my hair done my nails done and a pedicure it really was very touching that she did this
2254339 im tired of the cookie cutters i dont even want to be compared to kelly kelly because weve been mistaken a lot
2254340 i wake up in the morning as a redhead and i feel i just want to lock up with somebody and take them down to the mat
2254341 its definitely a big change but when youre third generation you have to be amazing you have to be incredible and i think this certainly embraces that third generation diva in me it really brings out those qualities
2254342 victoria is an incredible competitor and to be able to beat her was amazing to do it on my first night on smackdown it was incredible i felt good going out there
2254343 im here to fight im here to show my passion and passion is my motivation all i wanted was to have a great match and to show that im here i dont care what you throw at me im going to fight back
2254344 i have green eyes and i think blue goes very well with my green eyes so it brings out the color
2254345 its great its a different experience a different atmosphere new competitors a new championship im excited to work with every single person on this show and i absolutely cant wait
2254346 my friend and i got fifth row seats right on the floor im so excited to see them
2254347 ive been a big fan of them ever since i was a little girl my dad was a big fan i love all their songs i know them all by heart im just so excited about it
2254348 the ring was in the bottom of the tent area so the rows came all the way upward so the action was going on down in the lower part of the tent it was so much more intimate than at a regular live event
2254349 youre so much closer to the fans you interact with them and youre up close and personal with them
2254350 i am kind of a dancer but as you can tell im really really shy i thought i was going to try and dance but i didnt really know what to do
2254351 i thought victoria was being nice and she started to dance with me but she shoved me to the ground after i started having fun and i should have learned from before shes not my friend shes just so mean
2254352 i won two of the three shows which was really cool it was really exciting
2254353 i know a lot of guys when they get into the sports entertainment industry they change where theyre from for almost 30 years ive been representing glens falls so to be recognized in my hometown is quite an honor
2254354 the ability to keep going is always important i know everyone has their hard times in life but you can never quit i was blessed growing up my father was my hero and taught me a lot
2254355 your make a wish and circle of champions t shirts are nice but here are my signature t shirts you can wear in case you spill mustard or ketchup on yours while eating during the show
2254356 everyone who works with make a wish from all sides of the foundation knows how valuable it is to have those wishes come true to be chosen by joshua and jacob to grant their wishes out of the fact that i enjoy contributing to make a wish thats a huge honor
2254357 meeting john cena stunned me i chose john cena to make my wishes come true because i only focus on two things wrestling and john cena hes pretty cool and laid back
2254358 the thoughts that went into getting him the hat was that he likes wearing camouflage im glad he liked it the four hour drive with my family was all worth it
2254359 im concerned what message it sends to dress the kids this way while
2254360 the woman who called wall streets meltdown and what she sees next
2254361 its great that my wife is featured in fortune magazine shes one of the 50 most powerful women in new york city as long as she can stay in that top 50 category she will stay the current mrs layfield
2254362 i think we are the hottest power couple in new york city shes been the hottest analyst on wall street for several years now and shes married to jbl thats the formula that you cant not succeed with
2254363 its overwhelming theres no better business publication in the world than fortune it has brand in business thats unparalleled they put the single best people on their magazines and they pick the single best writers for their stories
2254364 its the greatest honor its amazing the hundreds of people who have preceded me have been people i admire and respect
2254365 work ethic was the key to my success and i love what im doing so it doesnt feel like work at all
2254366 find something you love doing its ok to change jobs a bunch of different times if youre not good at what it is youre doing do something else because youre going to find something that you are great at find an area that hard work will pay off lastly set realistic goals achieve them and keep recalibrating your goals
2254367 hey lliam how about repeatedly hitting yourself in the head with a blunt object
2254368 i had a fairly normal childhood but in some ways it was like growing up without a dad
2254369 but the time we had at home with him and my mom really made it count
2254370 my father was very protective of his three daughters he really tried to protect us from wrestling
2254371 at sunday dinner my grandfather would cook for 40 or 50 people sometimes even 75
2254372 then after dinner wed have our matches my grandfather designed and built the ring himself
2254373 we had our own wrestling promotion called the kwa the kids wrestling association
2254374 and we had a belt that we designed and made out of styrofoam
2254375 i cant remember a day in my life we havent talked about wrestling my uncle was big on saying were not going to talk about wrestling and then five minutes later well talk about wrestling
2254376 i was too scared to go back to wrestling i was finished with it i was so traumatized by this injury it was like a gun going off
2254377 it traumatized me so much that i wanted to quit wrestling
2254378 i met people who had been to hell and back
2254379 i realized i had so much unfinished business i realized this is my dream and that knee surgery is what took me to the next level it was meant to happen
2254380 everything is mental my grandfather used to say that and without that knee injury i dont think id be the person i am today and its funny how i almost gave up my dream because of fear
2254381 if youre a jackass and want to hate other people as much as possible whilst simultaneously costing the state tax revenue vote yes
2254382 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
2254383 hey now i see you are overstaying the lock moorings
2254384 this fascist move is really beyond the pale of all the things that she wants to appear
2254385 i support federal legislation that would outlaw flag desecration much like laws that currently prohibit the burning of crosses but i dont believe a constitutional amendment is the answer
2254386 i favor protection of the flag but i do not favor a constitutional amendment
2254387 take whatever legislative action it deems necessary and appropriate to honor and safeguard the united states flag
2254388 around that time dean rather pompously declared that politicians should declare their positions on the flag issue before voters went to the polls in 2002
2254389 no shes taking the position because the majority of americans feel that
2254390 before you hang up i want you to know i am a democrat an officer in my county party and i hold a vote in my state party it is obvious you dont want a dissenting opinion on the air especially from democrats
2254391 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
2254392 he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office
2254393 but after the doctors office well get ice cream who doesnt like ice cream
2254394 i could no more repudiate him than my own family or words to that effect to 2

2254396 from what i can tell their approval process is not very strict at all
2254397 its more technical than content related is what it seems like to us i think they run it start it up and if it doesnt crash they approve it they brainlessly click through and if theres problems they remove it is what it seems like
2254398 theyre shooting themselves in the foot these days theyre probably just understaffed
2254399 well see how it goes hopefully they dont get too much of the bad press and it doesnt ruin the iphone because i want to develop for it

2254401 this is tops having time to cook a yummo breakfast and take my time to enjoy it
2254402 i agree with the general proposals of the charter but i am particularly interested in the point about the fight for higher pensions and the abolition of tax on fuel and energy for old people and the poor
2254403 there are plenty of reasons for pensioners to back the charter we have the scandal where electricity and gas prices are going up sometimes at the rate of 40 percent
2254404 we have a situation where pensioners are being increasingly forced into a corner both in society and economically
2254405 there is no response to this from present day politicians we are being ignored the local councils newspaper doesnt have a word about elderly people in it
2254406 the government is increasing our winter fuel allowance by 100 when gas and electricity bills are going up by a lot more some 300 000 pensioners have dropped into poverty in the last year
2254407 the kind of feeling that pensioners have about all this must be built up to have a massive impact on 22 october
2254408 a 3 man crew on a 90 foot schooner two of them inexperienced no its not hard to believe at all

2254419 if you think of it in the context of another era its no different than someone stealing your locked briefcase containing confidential information from your lawyer prying it open and helping themselves to the contents the mere accessing and reading of privileged information is criminal this case however went well beyond just reading someones e mail

2254430 i am still troubled by the companys failure to directly inform their consumers of the consumer data gathering test and the notion that an opt out option is a sufficient standard for such sweeping data gathering
2254431 activity recognition is a key feature of many ubiquitous computing applications ranging from office worker tracking to home health care

2254448 as it has evolved here those involved in italo australian organised crime are in some ways totally different from earlier generations that is not to say that they are not secretive clannish and have the strength of community to rely on but the younger generation are not the same they do not operate the same or think the same as their parents or grandparents the code of omerta silence is not stuck to

2254513 how much effort did you put into winning the macbook air
2254514 first two days i think have been pretty good what your always struggling with is just getting back into the routine getting back into the habit of practicing and i think our guys are starting to do that the thing that i like about the first day was the fact we had a test and then we had practice which is also one of those tests in terms of your mental stamina which is one of the things we said we needed to improve to be a better football team this year yesterday we had the heat factor start to pick up a little bit hopefully today will be along the same lines which will give us another kind of stress test those are all good things that force us to be a better football team and our young men seem to be willing to work through them that gives us a good start the freshman have not been totally involved in everything that were doing but they are showing promise our upper class men seem to be taking the lead and those are all good signs
2254515 i love hot days obviously theres always a concern when you have heat and even heat in this part of the country about dehydration thats something very serious you dont play with that but when you talk about adding another factor for the mind to have to deal with and negotiate with all those things are wonderful i could take rain and make that into another mental test for us its something you have to work above and beyond anything that happens a change in practice a change in the schedule are things that you use to work your team through mental situations everyone likes to get into a set routine and know this is whats going to happen this is where well be this is what well do but any of those changes forces you to adjust and those things make us a better football team so heat is always welcome
2254516 obviously it is so early to be very detailed about any of it but has come back and hes in wonderful good shape hes strong he works hard hes a leader thats exciting what we need form those guys is really to execute the dual role of a tight end which is to be an offensive lineman at times and to be a wide receiver at times if we can get that than we are a much stronger much better team and it allows us to be much more flexible with all of our formations
2254517 they all look like theyre swimming its a tough transition the swimming really doesnt start yet the first days are pretty good theyve got a couple of defenses that they looked at the first day so those are relatively easy adjustments for them to make now all of the sudden theyll start to have a few more defenses a few more adjustments that theyll start to see a few more changes on the run that theyll have to negotiate then all of the sudden they start to get more offensive plays so it just continues to build theyre doing fine and were pleased with them theyve shown exactly what we thought some athletic ability in some areas where youre just able to look at them as pure athletes and not factor in the mental part of it theyre doing very well
2254518 chris is a little bit different i dont quite consider him a freshman but he is a freshman so having that advanced arrival i think has been really been beneficial
2254519 its always wonderful to watch the freshman come in if you can remember back to where you had the week of acclimation for them and they were here by themselves it was wonderful they were the most confident kids in the world then all of the sudden just the mere presence of the veterans walking in that changed now as we start practice with those early days its kind of elementary we start getting up to high school then all of the sudden were in college and they start swimming its all good you try to prepare them for it the best you can and let them know the sequences that they will go through we as coaches have seen it many times try to educate them but there is no experience like going through it yourself and thats what theyre in the process of doing
2254520 hes not quite there yet i dont think hes back to 100 percent yet but hes moving well he initially made some good runs some good cuts one of the things that we really want him to work at is just finishing cuts we talked about his strength for his size hes a fairly powerful runner hes got some natural power now were looking for him to be able to take that and put a move on a safety and really open up some big runs
2254521 it hasnt had a chance to really display itself yet there havent been enough days obviously today is a good day for everyone because it gives all of our backs an opportunity to get a lot of repetition with the design of our practices so it will work pretty well

2254531 my sales rep will neither confirm nor deny rumors that ticket prices will increase sunday but there is lots of buzz around the reservations offices that stuff is going to happen very soon im assuming this means not only the annual ticket price increase but also the 2009 package and rate details which should be out within the next two weeks or so im guessing the oct dec promotional offers will be not far behind if youre already booked you will not be affected by the ticket price increase unless you make a change to your reservation at which point the updated total will reflect the new ticket pricing remember that if you dont need tickets then you dont need a package and packages are the only way short of an annual pass to get a dining plan packages are also the most likely way to get a discount you could save yourself 50 or more by buying tickets before the price increase for a future stay but then youd either have to skip the package form of reservation and a dining plan and any associated promotional discounts either of which could save you considerably more or shell out for a 1 day base ticket per person in order to book a package which will run you another 80 or so per person probably eliminating whatever savings you might otherwise have had or at least taking a big chunk out of it in other words if you are certain that you do not want a dining plan and will save more on buying tickets now than you cold possibly hope to save with a promotion then go for it otherwise just accept that your vacation is about to cost a little more than you thought it would nothing new there huh all the more reason to put your affordable disney membership to good use

2254546 hello john i just wanted to take the time to thank you for your affordable website and especially for beth foss wonderful help we returned from our family vacation at wdw last thursday evening and in spite of a couple of us getting sick we had a wonderful time there beth was so great about answering my questions no matter what i asked and always tried to get what we wanted she really helped me feel less overwhelmed about everything and was great to work with she is a real gem thank you too since i had to ask you a few things awhile back and you were very prompt about getting back with me i will recommend your site to all of my friends thank you
2254547 there was a time when i booked a lot of disney world vacations for people using non disney hotels that was before disney offered free airport transfers extra magic hours dining options and packages that made sense those perks cannot be overlooked at least one of them probably several can go a very long way towards providing you with a vacation more comfortable and convenient than any non disney hotel could and if you plan ahead then youve got an excellent shot at a promotional discount for most times of the year there are however times when you cant plan ahead there are other times that there isnt a promotional offer for your dates or nothing affordable is available under the promotional offer for those times it makes plenty of sense to look at hotels that arent owned and operated by disney particularly true if you dont need airport transfers and arent interested in a dining plan what you need to keep in mind though is that a wide angle camera lens and a creative hotel staff can make a real dump look like pure luxury online i read an article recently posted in msnbc coms family travel section they were suggesting six hotels in the kissimmee area as non disney alternatives two of them ive never seen and two of them i often send people to myself the other two though i was shocked to see listed in fact i list one of them among the worst hotels ive ever checked out its true that online it looks nice enough the location is pretty good it has a separate check in desk for kids and it has a name that makes it sound like mickey himself probably vacations there i was shown two rooms there though that i wouldnt have sent clients on the tightest budgets to the carpets were so dirty they were sticky the small refrigerators had mildew in them and im pretty sure the microwaves has never been cleaned id have been afraid to take a shower without flip flops on my feet ick i actually stayed at a different hotel once not on the msnbc list that looked fabulous online bedroom living room full kitchen managers reception with beer wine and hors doeuvres nice the pictures online were lovely the actual units didnt look anything like the photos online well they sort of did in that the layout was the same the furniture we had though was stained and worn and falling apart the bedding was dirty as were the towels the little electric burner in our kitchen didnt work and it was colder in the room than in the frig there was no beer at the managers reception only a big jug of cheap red wine which went well with the basket full of popcorn the only food offered the pool wasnt heated but it was so dirty my daughter didnt want to go in anyway big disappointment great location and a nice price but i wont be going back my point is that you need to do some homework if youre going to stay offsite or at least talk with someone thats stayed in the place youre considering forget the online photos check out tripadvisor com or wejustgotback com to see if there are recent reviews keep in mind that people tend to complain more than say nice things so you cant assume no nice comments means everything is bad do however consider the types of things being said are they things that youd never notice or things that would drive you nuts if you need to stay offsite i can get you into rooms from about 32 a night including tax but i wouldnt recommend those places you really dont start getting into the moderately acceptable ones below 50 60 a night most times of the year 75 tax will get you into something not too bad at all and 100 120 will get you something pretty decent there are exceptions of course but thats sort of a good scale to follow beware of places that are selling super cheap theres probably a reason for it and you need to figure out what that reason is before you book

2254596 theyre a really eager group a fun group of young men to coach and talented weve got some tight ends that should be able to factor into some things
2254597 michael is probably the best of both worlds he can block catch and run routes
2254598 hes strong he works hard and hes a leader thats exciting
2254599 i love him he brings a great energy you see him out there in practices running around like hes twenty years old yelling at guys but its all positive he stays real positive
2254600 hes got a lot to say hes a real smart guy hes been a coordinator before so you trust him with the intricacies of the offense hes got a lot of new fresh ideas a lot of new knowledge to bring to us a new way of thinking about things so its really exciting
2254601 its going good everything is good just picking things up slowly trying to pick it up as fast as i can because the coaches are telling me that i need to be ready soon
2254602 its not far from what i expected the game speed has picked up and everyone is stronger and faster but mentally im getting there so its not as bad as i thought it would be
2254603 we havent put pads on yet but athletically hes talented enough to be able to contribute he has a ton of ability
2254604 well see what happens after a week or two of banging
2254605 hes definitely a very impressive looking athlete hes big hes got long arms and hes smooth hes real smooth he catches the ball really well he seems real natural theres just a couple of fine points to tune up but hes already looking like hes going to be a big time player
2254606 chris plays with a lot of confidence i really like how he plays he plays aggressive hes not the biggest tight end but he gets into you well and he blocks really well for his size theyre both going to have great careers here
2254607 those guys are great talents first of all tight end is a hard position to learn because youve got to know all of the run schemes and all of the pass schemes so theres a lot to learn
2254608 im just trying to help those guys absorb as much information as possible because theyre going to be real great talents once they can put all those mental aspects together theyre going to do great stuff but its definitely my responsibility to help them along mentally as much as i can
2254609 i think personally just knowing that im really the only skill guy coming back with experience i kind of felt a little more of a responsibility to make myself more of an impact in the offense and be more of a reliable target
2254610 help the guys around me fit in a little bit easier take some pressure off of them so i kind of try to take a little more responsibility in that respect
2254611 definitely during seven on seven were definitely getting the ball a ton id have three or four catches a day and mike would have three or four so were definitely getting used quite a bit
2254612 with me and mike were both seniors and were real focused on just doing the best we can we want to prepare ourselves as best we can for everything just work and when its time to go we expect to be ready

2254622 we were running around and saying this is all so frustrating how do i cope how do i get anything done we were open to trying anything
2254623 every one feels it has made them more productive and the frustration levels have disappeared
2254624 so many people continually feel overloaded stressed and frustrated and they cant put their finger on why the fact is that we are bringing this on ourselves by not questioning the cyber centric interruption laden lifestyle that is eroding our capacity for deep focus and awareness
2254625 and when you examine them many of our constant workplace distractions are ultimately secondary or trivial matters
2254626 in many cases people are ending up interrupting themselves and it is just a matter of taking the effort to create a better environment for thought
2254627 everyones brain is wired a little differently and there are things that work well for some but not for others so experimentation is important to find the best solution for each individual
2254628 we just need to push back from the extreme and learn to pay more attention to ourselves rather than the distractions that are defining our lives

2254926 before the extraordinary profitability of the last quarter of the 20th century newspapers were relatively unprofitable and breaking even was the primary financial goal of most publishers contemporary developments are taking us back toward that situation but even with the u turn in the business we need to recognize that newspaper revenue today is better than it was in 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s and 1990s in fact adjusted for inflation newspapers in 2007 had two and a half times the advertising income that they had in 1950 in terms of employment there are still twenty percent more journalists working in newspapers than in the highly profitable years that fueled the growth of corporate newspapering
2254927 it should be no surprise then that the form of legacy news provision is no longer as successful as it was in the past those who own and work for legacy organizations see the changes as cataclysmic but the shifting of functions to more forms is natural and provides significant benefits to those who want news and information we have seen this type of displacement before even within our lifetime

2254944 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut it down
2254945 until apple actually does something malicious with this the internet noobs need to quit their bitching
2254946 there are a ton of different paths that lead to doom
2254947 i maybe had time to examine four or five dominos
2254948 the value of this class of bugs is high enough that it justifies very extensive research
2254949 if there is such value by investing in the attacks we have to invest more

2254953 citations for recruiter wrongdoing have nearly doubled over the past several years and complains are up too
2254954 just because someone has done something wrong doesnt mean that they get the death penalty
2254955 theres a difference between the death penalty and a promotion
2254956 he was actually promoted after this what was the negative penalty

2254960 my attorneys fees were agreed at 25 percent were earned at 25 percent and i request that your honor please pay these attorneys fees at 25 percent of my recovery
2254961 ultimately i believe that a deal is a deal i received what i bargained for and our outstanding attorneys should receive what they bargained for as well
2254962 although i approved the settlements i did so without being aware of the considerations that now impel me to disapprove them
2254963 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book

2254965 its interesting rob richer talked to me and actually other reporters too yesterday morning he was fine hed gotten the book monday night read it and then something happened yesterday afternoon
2254966 its one of these instances where youve got a few people whose testimony could mean the impeachment ostensibly of the president
2254967 ive spent a lot of time with them their interviews are taped they talked to me at length hour after hour and all of that is on the record
2254968 the first amendment is the most important amendment if they take that one away then you should start loading your weapons
2254969 there are folks in congress calling they want people under oath with threat of perjury
2254970 maguires sent me things about truth and the power of truth hes a believer in that i think richer is too and well see how it unfolds
2254971 was like yelling and screaming and acting really erratically and they didnt know what the situation was so they asked him just to calm down and so forth and he made a movement towards them so they had to tase him
2254972 after he was tased and handcuffed one officer used a football type kick and stomped him in the head
2254973 they killed that man they killed him they killed him she added her hands trembling the woman said she saw one officer stomp on mr thomass upper back holding his foot there while the subject lay on the sidewalk with his head hanging over the curb another officer reared back and punched him in the head with all his might she said
2254974 i want to know what happened what the particulars of the incident were that caused my sons death
2254975 we need to drill here we need to drill now
2254976 the administrations own department of energy says the effects of drilling now wouldnt even be felt until 2030
2254977 oil company executives say that it could be as short a time as one to two years
2254978 cyborgs from the future have been sent here to drill offshore to prevent osama bin laden from killing john connor
2254979 to be fair obama released an energy plan that included a comprehensive list touching on everything from investing in alternative energy to turning off your lights to making sure your tires are inflated
2254980 he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires

2254982 ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2254983 any day that were not locked in a global battle with oil producing terrorist states
2254984 no its the sound of money being funneled to saudi arabia
2254985 to sum up tuning up your cars and keeping your tires inflated is unbelievably gay and only encourages the terrorists but stationary yet still roaring engines combined with banana fueled oral sex demonstrations are
2254986 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2254987 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here
2254988 the proof is always in the actions and not just the words
2254989 i thought it outrageous that a police chief could decide who may or may not post political signs and then tear down those he disapproved of
2254990 the states reading of the statute is overly generous to say the least
2254991 the statute makes no mention of traffic safety or any other purpose justifying the restrictions and sets forth no standards based on the characteristics of a proposed sign i e color size or shape it vests chiefs of police with unfettered discretion unconnected to any standards related to safety or any other legitimate consideration
2254992 an ordinance which makes the peaceful enjoyment of freedoms which the constitution guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled will of an official is an unconstitutional censorship
2254993 ultimately allowing the statute to stand would be an endorsement of a trust me because i am the chief of police standard
2254994 there can never be an excuse for helping put dangerous drugs onto our streets
2254995 when public employees are a part of the problem and when public medical benefits are used to make the scheme work these are shameful events they are also crimes
2254996 because we still see sales volatility from week to week especially around paycheck cycles
2254997 with the end of the stimulus checks we know consumers are spending more cautiously
2254998 it is like a minestrone and a lot of the vegetables are plastic
2254999 i found 26 pieces of plastic all different colors inside one stomach
2255000 the experts say there is no silver bullet we are going to keep looking but at the moment it is not clear what the best course of action would be to deal with the materials that are already there
2255001 the planet is a closed system so everything that happens on earth stays on earth
2255002 what we need to do is to accept responsibility at the local level and rescue the amount of plastic that comes down our waterways and into our ocean

2255006 it is clear that our health care system isnt giving americans the health care they need and deserve
2255007 the disorganization and inefficiency are affecting americans in their everyday lives and its obvious that people are looking for reform
2255008 with the upcoming election there is great opportunity for our leaders to hear what the american people are saying they want from a health care system and to respond with meaningful proposals
2255009 we may begin seeing pretty soon big american cities with no daily newspaper

2255011 india is a fascinating country where history is being made in many respects so it is a fertile place for good journalism hopefully some of the non indian journalists will have a better understanding of india when they do go back
2255012 its not the tough job market that sent me there yet i decided to go to india because the promised experience just seems tremendous readership is skyrocketing as are profits the managing editor also said he really wants to strengthen the multimedia elements of the web site and theres money available to put into development
2255013 i have met foreigners working at the hindu mint gq the hindustan times and times of india
2255014 they all work on indian salaries dont speak the language and all seem to be having a ball since there are so many new publications opening up in india there is a lot of demand for native english speakers and people who can bring higher reporting standards to local papers
2255015 i pretty much stick only to big investigative stories on subjects that i choose and leave the daily reporting and feature pieces to other journalists i have noticed that some american media houses are pulling back their freelance budgets just try getting an assignment past the foreign desk at npr these days but i bet that freelancers in america are feeling the pinch much more than i am while living on the rupee
2255016 id like to see more freelancers move to india there are too many stories to cover and just not enough time to get to them all
2255017 i thought i made it clear to you that this court comes first in everything

2255026 according to the u s department of defense private lavena lynn johnson killed herself on july 19 2005 eight days before her twentieth birthday exactly how did she end her life she punched herself in the face hard enough to blacken her eyes break her nose and knock her front teeth loose she douched with an acid solution after mutilating her genital area she poured a combustible liquid on herself and set it afire she then shot herself in the head despite this massive self inflicted trauma she somehow managed to drag her then fully clothed body into the tent of a kbr contractor leaving a trail of blood along the way and set the tent ablaze in a failed attempt to cover up her crimes against herself

2255033 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
2255034 theres too much money being illegally stripped from public health care programs and the potential impact to those with a legitimate need is too great to let such fraud escape federal prosecution
2255035 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2255036 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible

2255044 i cant help but think it im sleeping in the same bed where my mom and dad used to do it
2255045 george w bushs real contribution to language has been in redefining it for instance when people began suggesting that we think about leaving iraq
2255046 what i wont accept is you know the artificial timetables of withdraw
2255047 this is a free range organic war thats why it costs so much
2255048 what we need is a horizon a withdraw strategy named after something that no matter how long you head towards it you never quite reach it
2255049 you know ive worked in some bad retail situations not once did i ever shock a guys nuts
2255050 the job market isnt strong right now as we work through the downturn in housing and high energy prices we would like to see more job creation

2255052 veterans that were exposed to agent orange during the vietnam war have a twofold higher risk of prostate cancer
2255053 the cancer they get tends to be more aggressive a higher grade and is more likely to spread or have spread at the time that they present to their urologist
2255054 a lot of veterans dont get their care through the va veterans administration
2255055 this message needs to go out to their physicians and their urologist in the private community to know that this is a large risk factor
2255056 weve trained ourselves not to go to the maximum in our feelings when we see terrible things like this
2255057 the war was almost declared at an end in iraq and he went out with our cameraman to cover some story and while hes approaching an american checkpoint you can hear an american soldier on the tape say stop you have to go back and then the soldier just shot at them and killed both of them ali had got married two weeks earlier
2255058 i would sit here sometimes and go out of my mind crying and sobbing i dont think insurgents did this i dont think iraqi people did this i couldnt see the video that was released not because shes my wife but because i cant bear to see anyone assassinated
2255059 we believe that this new franchise par labor formed from h2a workers that will be ufw members is a giant step forward in helping mitigate the shortage of farm labor in the us
2255060 powerful post marisa our government is not doing nearly enough to protect these workers instead it is targeting them as well making them less able to negotiate reasonable working conditions with their employers
2255061 has told us for seven years that iraq is the front line in the war on terror
2255062 the u s military the presidential administration and our nation as a whole are officially more afraid of american gays than of middle east terrorists
2255063 this decision was taken in haste they are playing with fire
2255064 this is not the pakistan of the 80s and 90s
2255065 asif zardari and pervez musharraf are inseparable for their own self interest
2255066 impeachment is a device to distract attention from the restoration of the judges
2255067 to protect freedom of expression freedom of religion and freedom of opinion in your country including tibet

2255103 they consistently said that it was the stores policy and that other customers felt offended by it
2255104 it seemed as if i had been stealing or something so i was very humiliated
2255105 they were actually pushing her into it i became upset at that point
2255106 my heart goes out to her its the most humiliating thing she could have possibly been subjected to whenever a woman is told breastfeeding is offensive or indiscreet its shaming new mothers for doing whats right
2255107 shes responding as a mother should do to her babys every wish to be walked or told to go into a cupboard or a room out of sight would make her feel as though shes done something criminally wrong

2255116 we couldnt find any other national reporters in the area at the time
2255117 my friend the writer from the palm beach post said well stephen youre guilty of being black while reporting this guy had to know that we all werent national because he had to be familiar with them so if he didnt recognize me well he surely couldnt recognize the other reporters there also
2255118 in the 2000 presidential campaign john mccains openness to reporters and their access to him underscored the image mccain wanted to advance as a straight talking honest maverick unscripted unafraid uninterested in having consultants micro manage his statements

2255286 a clique of u s industrialists is hell bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government
2255287 this is the worst i have seen it here in 20 years
2255288 people are in shock because they are used to the economy bouncing right back but i dont think we are going to have that quick of a recovery
2255289 we have had such a long period of economic expansion and growth i dont think anybody thought we could have a recession like this
2255290 with housing we know it was a case where we overbuilt overlent and overborrowed and i think it was the same with commercial development when it comes to commercial development here it is driven by the demand of travel and tourism
2255291 i moved here from jersey im going to rent first but seriously look hard in this area
2255292 weve gone from having a better unemployment situation than the national economy to one that is slightly less

2255296 we really try to have people who donate for altruistic reasons thats the best of all worlds
2255297 its more invasive than donating sperm but still its painless and theres more time involved but we try to make it as smooth a process as possible
2255298 you always think about the extra hours you could put in at work to get the extra money so you can be where you were before but i think it is important to remember that you still need to give back

2255317 the severe economic downturn in our nation in our region and in the real estate values in the markets we serve
2255318 all of the capital raised in the first quarter for commercial and investment banks is under water

2255333 market intervention is a policy thats been undertaken a few times i think its something that should be done only rarely but there may be conditions in which markets are disorderly where some temporary action is justified
2255334 this is a situation crying out for intervention and leadership

2255338 i am hoping we can have a dialog on sierra climate change
2255339 personally id have coffee and intellectually honest discussion with a flock of banana slugs if a hospice donation were in the offing
2255340 no lets just discuss the science here on nc media watch
2255341 it was like trying to argue with the outflow from a piece of pipe there was no dialog or any observable change in behavior
2255342 when youre the one donating you get to set the venue ok ill be happy to rebut you here on your blog any time you want to donate a hundred bucks to hospice but this time its my money so my choice of locale
2255343 if we are going to debate lets do it in public
2255344 i have a hundred readers they cant all show up there
2255345 you are ours because youve stood by us not only in triumph but more in importantly in times of despair
2255346 went exactly as planned and expected and has been described by the doctors involved as completely successful
2255347 its an afghan government plan he gates has endorsed and we are now working to achieve
2255348 now who would pay for that those are the discussions we are just now beginning to enter into it would be wrong to assume we are going to shoulder this burden alone
2255349 we are going to work with our allies to determine how we can finance this necessary growth
2255350 quality versus quantity we are focused there on remediating and reforming the police forces that currently exist
2255351 the main additional responsibility he is assuming is for the training mission which is just an essential mission for the afghans and for us
2255352 the sooner they are a capable fighting force and can assume responsibility for protecting their own people and their borders the sooner us forces and the worlds forces can come out

2255355 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2255356 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives
2255357 we are a freedom loving nation right now under attack
2255358 we urge all the parties including georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate and avoid conflict
2255359 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a ceasefire
2255360 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
2255361 if this is not war then i wonder what is
2255362 there is a threat of even more large scale russian aggression against georgia georgia faces an existential threat amid russian aggression
2255363 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2255364 there should be only one ossetia we want to live with our brothers
2255365 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2255366 price optimization is fast becoming the go to solution for profitable growth particularly in discrete manufacturing and industrial distribution
2255367 many of our customers in these industries are reporting double digit margin growth despite rising material costs and a slowing economy our unique ability to deliver results like these is a clear demonstration of zilliants position as the de facto price optimization solution for b2b companies
2255368 the potential for this market is significant because defining and defending optimal prices is a fundamental imperative for enterprises responsible for producing returns for stakeholders
2255369 the price optimization and management market differs from most other applications because it offers strategic benefits helping organizations grow revenue and margins and operational efficiencies helping companies save time and cut costs
2255370 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2255371 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives

2255379 there should be only one ossetia we want to live with our brothers
2255380 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2255381 the world was watching and i hope they loved it too
2255382 i strongly believe societies that allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2255383 the chinese government and people have seriously implemented the solemn commitments made to the international society since beijing won the olympic bid in 2001
2255384 uh put the bee in the actually put the whole dish in the trash can
2255385 this email is to remind you that theres a dish and a towel in the trash can and can you please take them out
2255386 so you mean theres also an angry bee in the trash can
2255387 uh yeah i guess i didnt think of that part
2255388 well it seemed kind of lethargic maybe its dead now or sleeping and not angry
2255389 weve further strengthened security at the embassy and taken the monks into preventive custody
2255390 there has been an agreement ubs will pay 19 4 billion dollars to buy back these securities
2255391 todays solution provides further relief beginning in september to investors who have been understandably frustrated by the industry wide failure of the ars market
2255392 our clients have been caught in an unprecedented liquidity crisis
2255393 whereas immigrants can stabilize shrinking populations facilitate economic growth revitalize neighborhoods replenish work forces and increase property values and immigration can be the key to a states citys or towns growth and prosperity
2255394 recently in this part of the state the acambaro chain was busted because they were paying workers in cash under the table no taxes withheld in l a county the l a times estimates that 40 of all workers are paid in cash no taxes withheld in construction work it is common practice to hire one legal hispanic subcontractor who does pay taxes but who hires a crew that is paid in cash no taxes withheld when one of these folks gets hurt on the job they rush them to the emergency room and get free medical care
2255395 i understand that many illegals are paying taxes by means of identity theft or bogus id numbers but there is good reason to believe that they consume far more in social services than they pay in taxes
2255396 it is like someone inviting themselves to your family outing at the restaurant where you agree each person will pay an even share of the bill
2255397 in addition the dollars they keep are not spent in our community as they tend to send all extra money back home this drains money out of a community
2255398 when one of these folks gets hurt on the job they rush them to the emergency room and get free medical care
2255399 also our tax system is highly progressive low earners dont get as much held out
2255400 in addition the dollars they keep are not spent in our community as they tend to send all extra money back home this drains money out of a community
2255401 all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed
2255402 statesmen my dear sir may plan and speculate for liberty but it is religion and morality alone which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand
2255403 the only foundation of a free constitution is pure virtue and if this cannot be inspired into our people in a greater measure than they have it now they may change their rulers and the forms of government but they will not obtain a lasting liberty
2255404 we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion avarice ambition revenge or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
2255405 religion and virtue are the only foundations not only of all free government but of social felicity under all governments and in all the combinations of human society
2255406 perhaps not anymore but the average american is better than the average illegal alien when it comes to respecting the law
2255407 as mayor of the next host city of the summer games boris johnson has a vital formal role to play in the handover ceremonies for both the olympic and paralympic games in beijing and is very much looking forward to taking part
2255408 the mayor has ensured the number of staff travelling to the games is kept to the absolute minimum he will personally only be present for the last few days of the olympics and will travel with just three members of his team
2255409 following his election boris johnson immediately set about cutting the costs of londons involvement
2255410 an extensive experience of legal and international affairs to integrate the legal dimension in the internal decision making processes to promote the rule of law in international relations and to contribute to the strengthening of the culture of the end of impunity
2255411 a lion in the house follows the stories of five exceptional children and their families as they battle pediatric cancer from the trauma of diagnosis to the physical toll of treatment this series documents the stresses that can tear a family apart as well as the courage of children facing the possibility of death with honesty dignity and humor as the film compresses six years into one narrative it puts viewers in the shoes of parents physicians nurses siblings grandparents and social workers who struggle to defeat an indiscriminate and predatory disease
2255412 it seems clear the market responded to what regulators wanted short sells naked or not have accounted for a little over 1 percent of our clients total volume 2 3rds of that short sell volume disappeared on the first day the rule went into effect for fannie mae and freddie mac its more dramatic at 90 percent
2255413 engaging african communities in the hapmap project the nhgc is participating in the international human haplotype map hapmap project aimed at characterizing patterns of common variation across various populations or geographic regions as a means of developing a more efficient tool haplotype map for mapping genes underlying susceptibility to common disease the overall project includes the engagement of a number of communities populations around the world collection of samples from members of these populations genotyping of the samples and analysis of the resulting data the nhgc has been leading the effort to engage communities in west nigeria east kenya and southern africa south africa and to obtain appropriate approval and consent for participation in the hapmap project community engagement involves several activities such as surveys town meetings focus groups and in depth interviews which combine to create a process for considering the risks benefits and relevance of the development of a haplotype map of the human genome community engagement and sample collection are proceeding at the sites
2255414 when the economy is struggling it is not a good time to raise taxes
2255415 we need to cope with the revenue we have and weather the storm if there were a recession proof tax that didnt hurt people then someone at mit would have thought of it
2255416 it is not surprising that we are faced with economic problems when the national economy experiences a downturn
2255417 balls all true but i thought too much of them one to watch the real question is not where liverpool will finish in the league but how long will rafas beard last before he realises it is a catastrophic mistake ff signing one of the defenders torres will be pricey and wont score enough goals
2255418 this is a big season for martin jol spurs have made steady progress in the last few years but with arsenals apparent slump this looks like being their big chance to break into the top 4 jol has been given time and money if he doesnt do it this year what odds on the tony soprano a like wearing a concrete overcoat and sleeping with the fishes
2255419 everton under moyes have seemed to lurch from good season to bad season and then back again
2255420 martin oneills arrival last time seemed to be the most important thing to happen at villa park in years and although his first season was one of steady rather than spectacular progress perhaps we should expect more this year
2255421 true enough although i underestimated quite how much ff signing gareth barry solid points scorer with steady assists and the odd penalty ive also got a soft spot for olof mellberg for some reason
2255422 surely the biggest news for newcastle is that they have finally got rid of fat freddie shepherd and in big sam allardyce they might finally have a manager with the drive and ambition to take them somewhere
2255423 if michael owen stays fit then who knows where they could go whats going on between the chairman and big sam though where are the really big signings why is dyer still there
2255424 one to watch craig bellamy hes quick and talented and sure to score goals mind you hell be worth watching just to see how quickly he blows up and goes after one of his team mates with a golf club if kieron dyer ever signs it might be worth watching lee bowyer too ding ding round 2
2255425 this is a big season for gareth southgate hes lost viduka and is under pressure to sell yakubu how will he cope without the heaviest striking partnership in the league i predict a difficult season
2255426 of the promoted sides they are comfortably the favourites to avoid the drop whether they can or not probably depends as much on the manager as it does on the players
2255427 this is laurie sanchezs big chance in the premier league and he gave up the northern ireland job to make the most of it still his signings should make him feel right at home baird davies hughes and healey were all members of the norn iron side that beat spain they only avoided relegation by a single point last season and i imagine it could be more of the same again this time around
2255428 steve bruce did really well to get birmingham out of the maelstrom of the championship last year and rumour has it he was inches from getting the boot at christmas but he hung on and his side came back strongly to clinch automatic promotion
2255429 well no but it turns out that steve bruce was one to watch titus bramble once touted as an england defender in waiting now just openly laughed at for his physique and his tendency to drop at least one bollock every single game perhaps the politest thing to say is that he has a lot to prove
2255430 hmm i think this is going to be a long hard slog
2255431 its more dark than light so i wait i want to wait i want to watch myself see and more than anything i want to understand finally and forever light emerges from darkness
2255432 we cannot live for ourselves alone our lives are connected by a thousand invisible threads and along these sympathetic fibers our actions run as causes and return to us as results
2255433 i want whats best for the packers and my teammates and if that is aaron being the starter then so be it
2255434 come on open your mouth let me see what you have in there i know you have something in there open your mouth

2255438 we dont have anything that cheap the lowest thing we have is 99 00
2255439 some of the people involved in the attack were young girls aged about 12 years old
2255440 this service is essential for people who are housebound through illness or who are elderly or infirm
2255441 if these people do not receive their medication then they could be in extreme danger
2255442 it seems that any vehicle has now become the target of these stone throwers and i would appeal to parents to ensure that their children are not involved in this type of activity as it is important that this service is maintained
2255443 it was an urgent medication supply of heart tablets i continued on up and got the medication to the lady who needed it
2255444 he gained 24 oz thats more than an oz a day since you last saw him
2255445 thats not how i do it here in my practice
2255446 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone
2255447 hanging out at the surface would be a daft strategy for avoiding predators because that is where they can spot your silhouette
2255448 hi line will add three new territory managers for industrial sales in the northeast alone over the next few months

2255455 hundreds of thousands of tiny white eggs each about 1 millimeter in diameter grouped in clusters
2255456 when we turned the specimen we confirmed that the eyes were oriented antero laterally
2255457 other squid have eyes on the side of their head but they can swivel their eyes so they can see forwards and sideways
2255458 the same general geographic framework that criminologists use to catch criminals can be used by zoologists as well
2255459 this makes us think that it can be applied to other areas as well like epidemiology
2255460 they want to operate in a comfort zone close to an area they know but not where everyone knows them
2255461 in nature as a result of sexual conflict females often experience harassment from males which can be costly
2255462 in the presence of males females actively select areas of high predation risk but low male presence and thus trade off increased risk against reduced sexual harassment
2255463 the mission of the top 1 3 was to keep the middle 1 3 from being like the bottom 1 3
2255464 it also depends on the teacher in east l a or the nurse in appalachia the after school worker in new orleans the peace corps volunteer in africa the foreign service officer in indonesia
2255465 weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2255466 the next few years will see governments and businesses around the world making substantial investments in identity management infrastructures in order to prepare uk businesses for competition in this global market practical and cost effective solutions need to be developed which inspire public confidence by improving privacy and enabling consent as an integral part of future procurements
2255467 oh youll do fine youll do great on your exams

2255475 you know what you wanted was impossible for me to give but you also knew that what i wanted was best for you and me

2255493 gtk on linux huh i wonder just how much thought theyve given to accessibility

2255495 its not an insignificant part of peoples lives to get mail
2255496 were going to find some scheme that will work for us
2255497 on the one hand property owners pay taxes and are entitled to postal service on the other hand i understand some of the postal services concerns it seems to me there should be a cooperative way to work this out
2255498 whatever arrangement a community organization makes with a private ferry service is nobody elses business
2255499 personally i was horrified to learn about it because it is so far outside of normal procedure
2255500 theyve always liked it were going to explore if theres another solution that satisfies the postal service
2255501 i always enjoyed telling the uninitiated about the mail service to give them a better sense of the sutton island experience
2255502 its sort of like lighthouses in reality theyre not that useful anymore
2255503 behind the lifesaver like a little kid who hides behind a curtain and doesnt realize his toes are sticking out

2255505 the alzheimers association memory walk is the nations largest event to raise awareness and funds for alzheimer care support and research
2255506 a typical memory walk is a 2 3 mile walk held on a weekend morning in the fall
2255507 this is particularly true for women who are most affected by the epidemic as for far too long hiv positive women have been invited only after agendas have been set out or policy decisions taken

2255512 in these challenging times it is encouraging to see that overall businesses in the north east are among the more confident in the country about future conditions
2255513 but as were all aware sectors such as construction are feeling the effects of the slowdown particularly sharply so we certainly cant afford to be complacent even though the confidence being recorded by employers in the north easts important manufacturing sector and the wider forecasts for employment activity and export growth are welcome

2255528 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
2255529 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
2255530 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

2255567 were used to the dea calling in help from various federal agencies and local law enforcement but i guess none of their usual buddies were available yesterday because from the picture below which appeared in the la times today it looks like they had to resort to calling in blackwater
2255568 are members of a disputed mercenary killer group now working with the dea a photo from the la times shows proof of one of two things either blackwater members are now working for the bush white houses drug enforcement agency or this semi illegitimate band of rogue federal cops have worse discipline than any of us ever imagined
2255569 they were also used in raids in humboldt county last month against the growers operation southern sweep cant find any news stories about it but some people i know have said they were using blackwater as well as dea agents
2255570 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well

2255573 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
2255574 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
2255575 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
2255576 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
2255577 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
2255578 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
2255579 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
2255580 the islamic revolutionary guards corps has recently tested a naval weapon with a 300 km range in which no vessel would be safe and would be sent to the depths
2255581 enemies know that we are easily able to block the strait of hormuz for unlimited period
2255582 the strait and vessels are in range of our various weapons
2255583 in view of the proximity of the strait of hormuz to our shores this distance is within the range of an assortment of weapons and its closure for us is very feasible and we face no limitations from the point of view of time
2255584 we know they have been interested in having a relationship with our company for some time
2255585 we will of course be looking forward to how this will evolve
2255586 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union

2255589 i used to say the talking points that the unions a cult you dont want to join a union

2255593 kbr has a communication system but as with any system it does fail and we can only communicate with another installation by use of the cell phones
2255594 this intelligence community that was built to deal with foreign threats is now being slowly and incrementally turned inward
2255595 this kind of concentrated power exercised in secret is a lit fuse with our constitution likely in danger of being burned
2255596 makes clear as did the original order that all statutes have to be complied with when the intelligence community is undertaking activities governed by specific statutes
2255597 rather than violate an executive order the president has instead modified or waived it
2255598 if thats still the position of the department of justice then this entire exercise is meaningless
2255599 this all could be voided by presidential fiat without even amending whats written now
2255600 knowledgeable officials asserted that ivins had the skills and access to equipment needed to turn anthrax bacteria into an ultra fine powder that could be used as a lethal weapon court documents and tapes also reveal a therapists deep concern that ivins 62 was homicidal and obsessed with the notion of revenge
2255601 usamriid doesnt deal with powdered anthrax i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
2255602 has actually attempted to murder several other people he is a revenge killer
2255603 still trying to process a lot of information its come in really quickly a lot of it is just consternation at the ridiculous motives theyre attributing
2255604 i was the division chief and i didnt know that anybody did that
2255605 all of the challenges that we did with animals were with wet spores the dry spores i wasnt aware of
2255606 changes really began to accelerate in the last year he would sit at his desk weeping he really couldnt do his work any more because the pressure was tremendous
2255607 i think he committed suicide when he was walked out of the building escorted by law enforcement officials
2255608 its possible that somebody could hide that violent side from all of your co workers and nobody would ever hear about it but i really really doubt it
2255609 improve the system and help it defend ourselves and our allies
2255610 my mission has always been to defend america and for many years i sought to do this by producing intelligence as an active cia officer today using this book as a tool i seek to defend america by working to fix our broken clandestine service

2255615 some people had enormous output a few although they sat at their desks for twelve hours had none sending e mail to friends throughout the organization was a common time waster if anyone giggled while sitting at his desk it was a safe bet he was instant messaging with a friend in the agency if two people giggled alternately it usually meant they were sending messages to each other
2255616 0808 patch was applied to all systems confirmation that the patch was not grounds for requiring the system to be recertified at national and state level as well as verifiable analysis of the overall impact of the patch to the voting system
2255617 people working for diebold were told to keep this quiet so cox would not find out

2255621 according to williams they were both airlifted to the regional medical center in memphis where freeman was listed in serious condition monday morning the condition of freemans passenger has not been released
2255622 it is our responsibility to be aware of policy developments
2255623 nothings going to happen on this before he loses his job
2255624 i dont think that it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
2255625 we do not arrest and jail responsible alcohol drinkers this should be our policy with marijuana as well
2255626 forcing multiple vehicles to stop abruptly or change their direction to avoid hitting the defendant
2255627 clearly shows long trying to dodge pogan who appears to have remained upright the entire time
2255628 the police officer looked to see who he was going to pick off
2255629 all of a sudden the cop picked this kid out and bodychecked him i couldnt believe what was going on
2255630 if it wasnt caught on video people would not have believed it
2255631 the video just shows what the cyclists have been saying all along that the police are still harassing and intimidating them from doing group rides
2255632 northeast ohio has been incredibly hard hit by the bush administration
2255633 our message today is that we need politicians who are accountable to working families
2255634 were here supporting president bush because theres so many anti bush people
2255635 it took us a while to get to this position and its going to take us a while to get out of it
2255636 if we re worried about your gasoline price and recognize that its high because of the price of crude oil and its possible to find more oil right here in the united states doesnt it make sense to try to find that oil
2255637 its interesting to note that many of our consumers have already made the decision to switch away from automobiles like suvs that consume a lot of gasoline to smaller cars
2255638 why because youre smart you know how to handle your own business
2255639 on july 29 2008 over 100 working america members gathered as close as we were allowed to protest the president and his failed policies that have hurt countless americans this is a video of the motorcade when president bush went by among the gathered are the canton cleveland and youngstown offices
2255640 talked about how his attorney general is to review every executive order and immediately eliminate those that trample on liberty
2255641 he indicated there would be a review in his administration

2255646 the white house announced the signing by e mail moments later
2255647 bush initially vowed to veto the bill as being overly socialistic
2255648 he finally dropped his objection when he decided that it was better than nothing in a rare split house republicans opposed the bill and business interests like home builders and bankers favored it
2255649 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
2255650 what was seen as a dress rehearsal for an air strike
2255651 now that the bush administration is engaged in diplomatic efforts with iran many israeli officials are worried the us is getting soft on iran prompting israeli defense minister ehud barak to travel to the us this week to meet with defense secretary robert gates secretary of state condoleezza rice and national security adviser stephen hadley
2255652 we have a war with many veterans who suffer some from spinal cord injuries or paralysis

2255655 the 30 foot rat is a big rat a 12 foot rat you can kind of put in the back of a pickup truck a 30 foot rat you have to put on the back of a flatbed
2255656 thanks john ive been there ive done that you can find much better
2255657 the district court previously found that minor presented a danger to the community based on his alcohol abuse
2255658 there is evidence that supports the district courts finding that after a lengthy inpatient treatment minor defied and tested the courts condition of pretrial release which had been tailored to protect the public and prevent him from abusing alcohol
2255659 minors unauthorized sept 5 2006 meeting with a hurricane expert at a restaurant serving alcohol not only raised issues concerning his substance abuse problems it also showed his deception of the court
2255660 government prosecutors have chosen to continue the political prosecution of paul minor
2255661 in a case where even the justice department has raised the question of improprieties these prosecutors have refused to show compassion for a man whose wife is dying with cancer instead the politicization of the criminal justice system is continued by these prot g e of monica goodling

2255665 set of clear and rigorous principles such that restrictive governments would be unable to ignore or reject these best practices on freedom of expression and the protection of individual privacy
2255666 these errors did not affect the outcome of the election of directors
2255667 but you cant cross the finish line unless you have the secret number
2255668 we saw an opportunity to help people be more environmentally responsible and still get the latest and greatest technology
2255669 a year and a half after the debut of facebooks web site it was built by copying the look feel and features of facebook com
2255670 facebook is concerned that because studivz looks like facebook and incorporates similar features and functionality to facebook users will incorrectly believe that studivz is associated with facebook
2255671 somebody with a wireless device in china should expect it to be compromised
2255672 the game really feels epic in a way that the burning crusade didnt burning crusade felt like an extension of the original game this really feels epic and that youre part of something grand
2255673 i think itll be just as big if not bigger
2255674 bc was the biggest selling pc game sequel ever i think wrath might be a little lower than that but therell certainly be lines for it
2255675 there will be a lot of pressure to buy it and anyone who has a character at the highest level will pretty much consider it a necessity
2255676 youll be walking through the barrens an area in wow and youll see a steam tank drive past you with five people sitting in it or youll see a death knight clad in frozen armor with five ghouls walking behind him this stuff is wrath only after seeing that who wouldnt want the expansion
2255677 they took it up a notch with the complexity of the scenes and the intricacy
2255678 they have some areas which are now misty which is a really interesting effect walking through a mist previously they had sort of grayed out the scene and called it mist but now its hard to peer through
2255679 theyve again taken the end game and made it more accessible to more people
2255680 without costing the high end players without giving up the challenge that keeps the high end players motivated
2255681 i think blizzard has learned a lot from the last expansion release
2255682 even a group of ten people will be able to conquer the very highest end game content while 25 man versions will let people who want to be more hardcore do that as well
2255683 if youre familiar with the mechanics of the 10 person version
2255684 then you should be familiar with the 25 person version at least in the philosophical sense
2255685 and reward people for doing things they wont normally bother doing
2255686 i know that on their side theyre going to have tons of results coming back that will be useful and which will undoubtedly speed up their development process

2255696 we are a bit crazy together so we wanted something that suited
2255697 he must be killed the quran makes it clear if someone defames the prophet then he must die
2255698 in islam there is a line between lets say freedom and the line which is then transgressed into immorality and irresponsibility and i think as far as this writer is concerned unfortunately he has been irresponsible with his freedom of speech salman rushdie or indeed any writer who abuses the prophet or indeed any prophet under islamic law the sentence for that is actually death its got to be seen as a deterrent so that other people should not commit the same mistake again
2255699 an islamic tool for conversion and has been a willing propagandist jihad funder
2255700 has more to do with the sexual mores of a different time
2255701 the 20th century was defined by three trends the battle for freedom in the face of statism tyranny and marxist oppression the cultural supplanting of christianity in favor of secular humanism and evolutionary scientism and the general withdrawal of evangelical christianity as a source of cultural transformation in favor of a more ecumenical and sentimental gospel presentation
2255702 just over eighty nine years ago and within twelve months of each other three men were born who would help to define and shape each of these trends respectively alexander solzhenitsyn arthur c clarke and billy graham clarke died in march solzhenitsyn died yesterday only graham yet lives
2255703 today vision forum ministries and freedom loving christians all over the world mourn the death of the man most responsible for revealing the evil of the anti christian regime of joseph stalin and waging war against a machine of marxist oppression that caused the death of tens of millions
2255704 tortured and persecuted within stalins death camps solzhenitsyn nonetheless endured secretly authoring his greatest work
2255705 though solzhenitsyn was a devoted russian nationalist he was also a grateful resident of the united states during his years in exile from his homeland
2255706 in 1978 solzhenitsyn made the following appeal during his address at harvard
2255707 the courage of solzhenitsyn to boldly speak truth in the face of tremendous opposition touched the lives of many individuals including myself
2255708 the message of solzhenitsyns life was opposition to statist tyranny and the imperative of christian morality to freedom this message should be remembered as america approaches the beijing olympics communism is not dead nor is the world free from the ravages of statism and tyranny nor have we yet to understand the implications of solzhenitsyns life message and warning to the west we will be a moral and christ loving people or we will cease to be a people
2255709 i am sure they students at harvard do not show such a veneration for aristotle as is expressd at queens college in oxford where they read aristotle on their knees and those who take degrees are sworn to defend his philosophy
2255710 and then well theres nothing like a stupid red bull event to draw thousands and thousands of people we waded through the throngs to watch grown men in getup drive vehicles straight into the river to crash
2255711 pay this bill now in advance dont lose the chase visa
2255712 the performance art duo fuchs marino present a concert of structured time all pieces involve different ways of expanding contracting organizing and playing around with time

2255722 parts of britain which were unconquerable and unapproachable by the roman armies have yielded to christ
2255723 the love of god increased more and more in me
2255724 with faith and the fear of his name the spirit urged me to such a degree that i poured forth as many as a hundred prayers in one day and even during the night in the forests and on the mountains where i kept my herd the rain and snow and frost and sufferings which i endured excited me to seek after god at that time i felt not the indifference which now i feel the spirit fermented in my heart
2255725 go thou no further nor touch the man go back at once
2255726 this is an unjust decision o diarmait and i will be avenged
2255727 the weight of the irish influence on the continent is incalculable
2255728 the last citadel of liberty in the western world and popery was filled with anger at that miserable band which in its remote corner refused to bend before it
2255729 long concealed the hidden fire which after many ages burst forth with such power and might here and there a few independent spirits were to be found who testified against the tyranny of rome
2255730 the englishman and the scotsman representatives of two great systems were about to engage in deadly combat in the heart of europe in a combat whose consequences might be incalculable

2255732 patricks gift to the irish was his christianity the first de romanized christianity in human history a christianity without the sociopolitical baggage of the greco roman world
2255733 i would not bow my knee before that most abominable idol for all the torments that earthly tyrants can devise god so assisting me as his holy spirit moves me to write unfeignedly and albeit i have in the beginning of this battle appeared to play the faint hearted and feeble soldier the cause of which i remit to god yet my prayer is that i may be restored to the battle again and blessed be god the father of our lord jesus christ i am not left so bare without comfort but my hope is to obtain such mercy that if a short end shall not be made of all my miseries by final death which to me were no small advantage that yet by him who never despises the poor and afflicted i shall be so encouraged to fight that england and scotland shall both know that i am ready to suffer more than either poverty or exile for the profession of that doctrine and that heavenly religion whereof it has pleased his merciful providence to make me amongst others a simple soldier and witness bearer unto men
2255734 the first thing i am going to do when we get to the island is to kiss the ground
2255735 the holy scriptures are the only rule of faith throw aside all merit of works and look for salvation to the grace of god alone beware of a religion which consists of outward observances it is better to keep your heart pure before god than to abstain from meats one alone is your head jesus christ bishops and presbyters are equal they should be the husbands of one wife and have their children in subjection
2255736 parts of britain which were unconquerable and unapproachable by the roman armies yielded to christ
2255737 thats how serious they were nothing was more important to them than christ the king of the world the head of the church the only redeemer of gods elect and they were not going to compromise one iota of his revealed truth
2255738 all scripture is god breathed and all scripture is profitable that the man of god might be thoroughly equipped unto every good work

2255787 if you think about it in terms of multiple simultaneous users that is an interesting property
2255788 you can imagine scenarios that involve gaming would be fun
2255789 we are interested in this because it has some very unique properties and no one has really explored it at this level before
2255790 there are not product plans for this of course this is just one of many efforts to explore different form factors that are sort of a play off the surface
2255791 this has been a really fun project and it has got us thinking about other form factors as well

2255795 theres no question i stink im not denying it i do have an odor ive been playing for 17 hours
2255796 freedom actually drives a more vibrant economy than restriction and control
2255797 we just decided to move on in another direction and wish him the best
2255798 we tried to make some trades things did not materialize
2255799 we obviously had talked to different teams to see if there was an interest and looking at our situation eventually they knew this would happen
2255800 now im sure hes going to get an opportunity to go play somewhere else
2255801 its time to play football im just getting ready to go play
2255802 the chargers were great to work with and antoine is excited to get going
2255803 of course i was concerned but i had faith that it would get done all i could do was work out and control the things i was able to control and that was that i didnt worry about it too much because i knew it would get done so i did the things i could control
2255804 i definitely think i did have a good offseason and worked hard to put myself in a position to be here
2255805 i just want to get out there and play well and do the things i know i am capable of doing and also learn this game a little bit more im new and just want to get in and learn
2255806 there was so much hype last year and so much expectation and all training camp it was super bowl and we werent afraid to talk about it
2255807 i fell in that trap too not that we werent focused but it seemed like all the focus was on the ultimate goal subconsciously we took some things for granted maybe maybe we overlooked the meat and potatoes part of the deal you know what i mean we were looking ahead for the dessert
2255808 to tell you the truth i dont think its anybodys turn
2255809 you know its how hard you work for it and in our case finishing up how we want to finish they always say the team that almost gets there last year should win it the next year thats all good but for us we just look at it as something weve got to do
2255810 its tough because whenever you look around at this team and see the kind of players we have the first thing you want to say is oh this teams going to the super bowl
2255811 but thats what started us 1 3 last year because we came into the season after a 14 2 season the season before automatically assuming we were going to the super bowl were thinking the opposite this year were taking it one game at a time and having a faster start
2255812 again we have an understanding of what it really takes we didnt know what it takes to play in an afc championship game we didnt know what its like to go on the road and knock off the defending champs but now we know so when all these things come arising again which we hope we get the opportunity again then weve actually been through it were not just feeling our way through it you know what its going to be like well have a clue
2255813 feels better than i could have imagined it its going to be really key to keep staying on top of it ive been told by many people that know the deal that its going to get tired if you let it its the strength itll run out of gas quicker just keep filling up the tank
2255814 the only expectation we have is to play as good as we can
2255815 and we know that if we do that well be in good shape
2255816 since his arrival luis has been played a huge role in the success weve had as a defense
2255817 hes an ascending player who is committed to getting better were thrilled that hell be a charger for years to come
2255818 you know i am not usually short of words but today is different
2255819 three years ago all i looked for was an opportunity a chance to come into this league and play and prove the kind of player i was and prove the things i could do on that football field and to be standing here three years later committed to san diego for seven more its an unbelievable feeling
2255820 everybody knows look around this team of the incredibly talented players we have
2255821 its a credit to the chargers to put themselves in this position they have all these young guys who they are going to have to take care of look at their plan they are doing everything they can do to keep us together
2255822 since his arrival luis has played a huge role in the success weve had as a defense
2255823 hes an ascending player who is committed to getting better
2255824 a great deal for both sides its going to be fun to watch luis play at a pro bowl level the next seven years
2255825 gives everybody a lift it tells us what the organization is about obviously we are committed to keeping the guys that have been productive and luis is an outstanding football player and it will make me sleep better each night hes cranked up and ready to go he has had a great offseason
2255826 today is a great day but it is just the start of it
2255827 there is so much i want to achieve on the field on an individual basis goals of my own but there is so much i want to help this team do to be part of a super bowl in san diego and to be here for a long long time
2255828 as long as i can step on the field and look my teammates in the eye and know i have done my part that is what i want to achieve
2255829 barack is talking down to black people i want to cut his nuts off
2255830 im no expert in these matters but she should probably be sad for your sister
2255831 there comes a time when every parent must watch their child go off to jail
2255832 i hope they will send me a letter detailing exactly what they mean
2255833 we found that its a way of teaching guys to maintain proper body angles and to keep their feet underneath them
2255834 you have to keep your foot under your shoulders when you do it
2255835 whats important about antonio is that when he hurt his knee in college i think he realized that hes not made out of brick and mortar
2255836 he works at it i tell all the guys i train who are in the nfl to take 60 days off after the season just to rest their bodies i think thats really important but with antonio i cant keep him away hes back seven days after the season even if its just to do some cardio work
2255837 you take guys who have championship characteristics the size the speed the ability and you do your research to make sure they have the desire to work at it
2255838 im not na ve enough to think that some great players dont work at it or that you dont have to work with some guys to teach them how to work at it but thats not the case with antonio he does it some guys say in the offseason program ill see you monday then monday comes and you hear oh i had something come up not with him
2255839 thats how you want it to be when you play the best
2255840 hes the next of those guys who are the best of their era
2255841 i dont know if he has a nickname like prime time or whatever but hes going to have it soon his closing speed is just ridiculous you can get open against him but you cant stay open
2255842 he has that extra gear where he can not only outrun the ball but he can outrun the receiver to get to the ball
2255843 how fast am i as fast as i need to be
2255844 yeah i think im the fastest man in the nfl i dont know whos faster
2255845 youre not supposed to run that perfect when youre that big
2255846 antonio has the really unique ability to be able to change his speed depending on the situation there are a lot of guys in the nfl who are really fast but they dont have control of their speed antonio can accelerate or decelerate depending on the situation he just has great control of his stride
2255847 i said antonio youre not going to do that youre not an olympic high jumper
2255848 he just said well see so we get to the vertical jump and they set the top height at 44 inches
2255849 well antonio jumps up and cups his hand over the top of the whole thing everybody goes silent and just kind of looks at each other they didnt know what to really do but it takes awhile to set up the apparatus to measure the jump so they just write 45 and move on it was just ridiculous it was way past 45 whatever it was

2255879 you dont see the fallout in terms of physical play
2255880 and this isnt a stop gap this is a guy that could be a very productive player not just after four games but the entire season
2255881 and if you go into training camp and you wear your body out its just a matter of time before you have injuries
2255882 having a chance to win a championship is something that is very important to me
2255883 i think this group of guys and the coaching staff dont create that environment
2255884 i would say you could get lured into that but i think they have high expectations for themselves the coaches and players
2255885 you got to have those but you still have to be able to be loose go out and play football and not press you cant be a robot
2255886 he says he is re energized and im glad to hear that

2255892 i know he is making progress and he is on schedule
2255893 darren proved to me in the last seven or eight games last season that he can be a guy that can have an impact on the game and can have an impact on every game
2255894 thats our job as coaches to do that you give him the opportunity and its not going to happen every week but he certainly is a guy that can change games

2255937 the significant connection between the vocal pieces can thus appear in different lights according to their position in the instrumental development the chosen order will emphasize the apparent heterogeneity of the texts or their dialectic unity the texts are arranged in such a way as to suggest a gradual passage from a lyric transfiguration of reality proust machado joyce to a disenchanted acknowledgment of things simon for this text the voice speaks and becomes gradually nullified by the orchestra lastly the words of bertolt brecht which have nothing to do with the epiphany of words and visions they are the cry of regret and anguish with which brecht warns us that often it is necessary to renounce the seduction of words when they sound like an invitation to forget our links to a world constructed by our own acts
2255938 doing business became easier in many mexican states in 2005 2006 according to the new doing business in mexico 2007 report released today in mexico city the report finds that some states compare well with the best of the world while others need much reform to become globally competitive
2255939 if you were to open a new business in mexico city the start up procedures would take 27 days on average 8 days fewer than in shanghai if you decided to open a business in guanajuato or aguascalientes you would have to wait 12 days only one day longer than your competitor in amsterdam but if you needed to take a customer to court for a simple debt default in guanajuato resolving the dispute would take 304 days far longer than the 217 days it takes in dublin 1 but significantly shorter than in baja california sur where it takes 581 days these examples illustrate two patterns first some mexican states compare well with the best in the world second many states need much reform to become globally competitive

2255990 children are much smaller than they should be for their age a child that you think is a healthy two year old is probably a very underfed four year old
2255991 the angel of the lord encamps around those who fear him and rescues them o taste and see that the lord is good how blessed is the man who takes refuge in him
2255992 this means that the mistake must be at the root at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
2255993 the turn introduced by the renaissance evidently was inevitable historically
2255994 however in early democracies as in american democracy at the time of its birth all individual human rights were granted because man is gods creature that is freedom was given to the individual conditionally in the assumption of his constant religious responsibility such was the heritage of the preceding thousand years two hundred or even fifty years ago it would have seemed quite impossible in america that an individual could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his instincts or whims subsequently however all such limitations were discarded everywhere in the west a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice state systems were becoming increasingly and totally materialistic the west ended up by truly enforcing human rights sometimes even excessively but mans sense of responsibility to god and society grew dimmer and dimmer in the past decades the legalistically selfish aspect of western approach and thinking has reached its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse all the glorified technological achievements of progress including the conquest of outer space do not redeem the twentieth centurys moral poverty which no one could imagine even as late as in the nineteenth century
2255995 the problem is that now its all about consumption this spirit that has engulfed everybody mr
2255996 how can my mind be such chaos and still produce a coherent me
2255997 there is no single cell in the brain that is you
2255998 we know in the deepest part of our hearts that we cannot be redeemed by science or ideology
2255999 the danger for the western world to speak only of this is that today precisely because of the greatness of his knowledge and power man will fail to face up to the question of the truth
2256000 that the mind works a bit like a novelist were constantly telling a narrative about ourself to ourself
2256001 then we are defeated we are overcome by pain and evil it is just as well that the mystery did not think it useless to have mercy on our nothingness and through a fourteen year old girl entered into history
2256002 was the most important fact in history but we do not really believe it so when we are faced with a difficulty or a failure we are defeated we talk a lot about family society all important factors but do we have an i able to communicate this requires us not to be defeated
2256003 you govern yourself according to the destiny you are aware of this always implies a tearing away a wound in christian terms its called penitence or mortification mortification means that it seems like a death like a renunciation but it isnt because if someone chooses this t he then sees this b in another light he does not lose it
2256004 the companionships most external and evident value most clearly evident is that it calls you back to the religious sense to destiny
2256005 all that glisters is not gold often have you heard that told many a man his life hath sold but my outside to behold gilded tombs do worms enfold
2256006 so the community tells you not to be scandalized by temptation and not to be scandalized even at the mistakes you make but to indomitably take up the path again
2256007 error the possibility of error pertains to freedom that still isnt free that still isnt freedom that hasnt reached total satisfaction
2256008 as human beings we have within us a question a need a longing a plea about our lives our origins and our destinies
2256009 this question demands an answer indeed we are this question and like all questions we have an answer we do not know what ultimately we desire but we know that like nuala we are filled by a desire that life go on that our loved ones not be lost or forgotten that love beauty knowledge go on and never die we know in the deepest part of our hearts that we cannot be redeemed by science or ideology
2256010 it was possible some of his friends or supporters may have made payments without telling him
2256011 well i am sure that mr r doesnt get four weeks of holidays so he shouldnt be allowed to have another week at christmas when he already gets every other spring break and two weeks in the summer
2256012 yeah it hurt a little bit but you know you get used to it and its cool that shes doing it
2256013 well why does she do that anyway whats the point
2256014 you get off when you pee on her hand i didnt get off that day because i didnt have to go

2256017 theyre not pushy about how you should live or anything theyre just really big on helping other people like feeding the homeless and stuff
2256018 how are they to believe in him of whom they have not heard how are they to hear without someone preaching so faith comes through hearing
2256019 therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us also lay aside every weight and sin which clings so closely and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us looking to jesus the founder and perfecter of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the throne of god
2256020 hey this is real youre getting paid a lot of money it isnt all smooth sailing here you get paid the big bucks youve got to ride the tide not everything you do is right not everything you do is correct
2256021 i think when faced with the facts as we are we did not feel that comfortable with any of the available veteran guys i think in a perfect world youd have a veteran guy thats played some that can still play and be a mentor and all those sort of things the problem is you have to have somebody that you think can go into a game and help you win we felt comfortable with these two guys during the draft everything is a gamble you could say what happens if chad clifton gets hurt what happens if donald driver gets hurt or whoever thats just the nature of the nfl you cant really overly concern yourself with it we like our young guys
2256022 the packers were really talking about the wrong things and not the right things when they started talking more about the wrong things i just hung up the phone and didnt want to talk to them anymore i thought at first it was something that could have worked for the fact that brett favre was there but i think as the conversations occurred throughout the day and the next day i didnt really want to go to green bay
2256023 they were just talking about their team concept and the wide receivers and donald driver
2256024 it was like they were telling me that they were going to somewhat take a chance on me but if you do come here these are the things you have to watch out and be on your best behavior and donald driver is the top receiver here so dont come in and try to step on his toes and things like that
2256025 i didnt think that was right because my whole career i have been taken out of context sometimes but at the end of the day all i wanted to do was win games i didnt really feel they wanted me i felt that brett favre wanted me but i didnt really feel the packers wanted me
2256026 companies are continuing to invest in technology to reduce costs and enhance their information technology infrastructures
2256027 the only way to balance the market is by choking off demand which would require a spike above 200
2256028 oil has been very cheap now its becoming rather expensive
2256029 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened
2256030 is near simon and he says to him very softly without the others realizing he says quietly
2256031 every living thing gives proof of its life by that operation which is most proper to it and to which it is most inclined
2256032 nothing is more intelligent than following the companionship in which the lord who calls us has placed us
2256033 im too tired to make it all the way into bed ill just stop here
2256034 what has to happen for you to renounce that attraction to the secretary or whatever and come here
2256035 first a clear awareness of destiny love for destiny if one loses sight of destiny then he or she errs everyone a hundred out of hundred lives like this lets be attentive because we too live like this this is the horror this is against man its inhuman its man living according to a criterion that is against man thats what it seems like and the whole world says its right its comfortable you deserve it you want it so do it no because lifes destiny isnt that thing we want its the mystery of god awareness of the mystery awareness of destiny
2256036 jesus himself is the kingdom the kingdom is not a thing it is not a geographical dominion like worldly kingdoms it is a person it is he
2256037 where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them
2256038 heaven and earth are not separated by a great distance
2256039 what matters is not jesus coming from a great distance but his personal presence
2256040 a general lowering of moral standards throughout society a rise in infidelity a lessening of respect for women by men and the coercive use of reproductive technologies by governments
2256041 the great tragedy of population control the fatal misconception was to think that one could know other peoples interests better than they knew it themselves the essence of population control whether it targeted migrants the unfit or families that seemed either too big or too small was to make rules for other people without having to answer to them it appealed to people with power because with the spread of emancipatory movements it began to appear easier and more profitable to control populations than to control territory that is why opponents were essentially correct in viewing it as another chapter in the unfinished business of imperialism
2256042 contraception has released males to a historically unprecedented degree from responsibility for their sexual aggression
2256043 the onslaught of porn one social observer wrote is responsible for deadening male libido in relation to real women and leading men to see fewer and fewer women as porn worthy
2256044 if contraceptive intercourse is permissible then what objection could there be after all to mutual masturbation or copulation in vase indebito sodomy buggery i should perhaps remark that i am using a legal term here not indulging in bad language when normal copulation is impossible or inadvisable or in any case according to taste it cant be the mere pattern of bodily behavior in which the stimulation is procured that makes all the difference but if such things are all right it becomes perfectly impossible to see anything wrong with homosexual intercourse for example i am not saying if you think contraception all right you will do these other things not at all the habit of respectability persists and old prejudices die hard but i am saying you will have no solid reason against these things you will have no answer to someone who proclaims as many do that they are good too you cannot point to the known fact that christianity drew people out of the pagan world always saying no to these things because if you are defending contraception you will have rejected christian tradition
2256045 if paul vi was right about so many of the consequences deriving from contraception it is because he was right about contraception itself
2256046 this is exactly the connection few people in 2008 want to make because contraceptive sex as commentators from all over religious or not agree is the fundamental social fact of our time and the fierce and widespread desire to keep it so is responsible for a great many perverse outcomes despite an empirical record that is unmistakably on paul vis side by now there is extraordinary resistance to crediting catholic moral teaching with having been right about anything no matter how detailed the record
2256047 this elite developer is able to go in and directly interact with the thread libraries and other things hed know that if he called the xyz graphic function it wasnt safe and therefore hed be going from multicore to one core
2256048 however the conclusions arrived at by the commission could not be considered by us as definitive and absolutely certain dispensing us from the duty of examining personally this serious question this was all the more necessary because within the commission itself there was not complete agreement concerning the moral norms to be proposed and especially because certain approaches and criteria for a solution to this question had emerged which were at variance with the moral doctrine on marriage constantly taught by the magisterium of the church
2256049 the question of human procreation like every other question which touches human life involves more than the limited aspects specific to such disciplines as biology psychology demography or sociology it is the whole man and the whole mission to which he is called that must be considered both its natural earthly aspects and its supernatural eternal aspects
2256050 full awareness of their obligations in the matter of responsible parenthood which today rightly enough is much insisted upon but which at the same time should be rightly understood
2256051 physical economic psychological and social conditions responsible parenthood is exercised by those who prudently and generously decide to have more children and by those who for serious reasons and with due respect to moral precepts decide not to have additional children for either a certain or an indefinite period of time
2256052 that they are not free to act as they choose in the service of transmitting life as if it were wholly up to them to decide what is the right course to follow on the contrary they are bound to ensure that what they do corresponds to the will of god the creator the very nature of marriage and its use makes his will clear while the constant teaching of the church spells it out
2256053 the church proposes she imposes nothing she respects individuals and cultures and she honors the sanctuary of conscience
2256054 in preserving intact the whole moral law of marriage the church is convinced that she is contributing to the creation of a truly human civilization she urges man not to betray his personal responsibilities by putting all his faith in technical expedients in this way she defends the dignity of husband and wife

2256068 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2256069 producers such as venezuela could let production fall and nationalize the oil industry because there was no punishment for doing this when prices kept rising
2256070 proponents of peak oil who dont have the foggiest knowledge of petroleum geology
2256071 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola

2256083 the eucharist is the only place of resistance to annihilation of the human subject
2256084 the human race to account for not recognizing god and giving him the praise and honor that were his due
2256085 is evident to them because god made it evident to them ever since the creation of the world his invisible attributes of eternal power and divinity have been able to be understood and perceived in what he has made as a result they have no excuse
2256086 violence and hatred fills the world and even those who think they are above such things

2256096 ipv6 was supposed to be a solution not a problem
2256097 we use ip to allocate value and create incentives in society
2256098 just like many other powerful tools ip can be very useful but it can also be difficult to work with you can easily shoot yourself in the foot with intellectual property if you dont understand how and why this tool works
2256099 in fact i would argue that for most businesses in the united states the intellectual property part of the business is the most valuable part of the business
2256100 we are starting to see a swing away from stronger intellectual property protections and towards more openness and collaboration
2256101 people frequently have the mistaken impression that open source or free software is the opposite of intellectual property that is absolutely wrong
2256102 open source software is open source because of the way it is structured vis a vis the ip laws
2256103 clear correct and deep this is a welcome addition to discussions of law and computing for anyone even lawyers
2256104 productivity is defined as the amount of useful work performed over time

2256107 youve investigated psychics before agent mulder like luther lee boggs and clyde bruckmann and
2256108 he was bred to no profession he never married he lived alone he never went to church he never voted he refused to pay a tax to the state he ate no flesh he drank no wine he never knew the use of tobacco and though a naturalist he used neither trap nor gun he chose wisely no doubt for himself to be the bachelor of thought and nature no truer american existed than thoreau
2256109 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die to discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practice resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartan like as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and to be able to give a true account of it

2256121 javascript used to be a language that real programmers looked down on and which many people thought was only good for creating annoying pop up ads or making stars follow your cursor around the screen but then big sites like google maps and gmail got a hold of javascript and used it to create user interfaces that rival desktop computer programs javascript has never been as popular as it is now nor has it ever been as widely used to make compelling web interfaces
2256122 javascript opens up a lot of new design possibilities that can help web designers make web sites that are easier to use and which provide exciting interactive experiences this also means that javascript is now becoming another one of the must know tools of the web design trade so its important for designers to learn how javascript can be used to improve the look and functionality of their sites

2256213 widely known as the renaissance man of the indian art p khemraj focused on creating lasting art he had given a new dimension to modern art with his colourful and often mind boggling depiction of the female form that reflected sensuality and extravagant view of life at large in his artworks
2256214 the exhibition showcases his mural sized works on combined boards and early canvases as well as his delicate linear drawings swiftly moving on the surface with fluid grace his series fluttering with hearts is full of youthful exuberance and confesses his love for life
2256215 he would invite cognition of creative interplay of different forms of artistic activity brought about by his usual re reading of his poems avid strumming of musical instruments and formulate a visual cosmos in his canvas his creativity represented a play
2256216 khemraj represents the harmonious fusion of virginity and virility through a sensuous simplicity and passion
2256217 khem seemed to depict deep empathy for the damaged environment which gave birth to asha hans where he paints the vision of a paradise that could be our earth
2256218 artists like khem drop out of the straitjacket of the contemporary society that suffocates them that denies freedom wonder and sheer joy painting peacocks and flowers in superfluous abandon khem indicates his conviction that life is not a trust but a gift to revel in

2256281 todays technology companies are more globally focused with european standards like rohs becoming world standards

2256286 we had literally thousands of people who put their heart and soul into this place they wanted to be sure we got it exactly right and i think we did
2256287 their sole interest is in maintaining power by any means
2256288 i think their calculation is that the rest of africa is not going to do anything to stop them and the west is distracted by iraq and afghanistan the platinum mines can keep the core of the elite living in the manner theyre accustomed to just in a sea of poverty
2256289 hes in the twilight of his life and he wants it to be remembered that he left something to zimbabweans
2256290 thats the tragedy of this country those who benefited from land reform are also going to benefit from this takeover
2256291 uganda and rwanda who support the rebels fighting the congolese regime in kinshasa as well as allies of president laurent desire kabila angola namibia and zimbabwe have had no qualms about helping themselves to the riches in territories under their control unconfirmed sources in kinshasa say each allied country makes off with whatever valuable materials that exist in its sector the ugandans and rwandans plunder gold diamonds coffee and wood the zimbabweans diamonds and copper and the angolans oil according to the diamond office a division of the belgian customs bureau which exclusively oversees the import and export of diamonds uganda rwanda and zimbabwe have become exporters of diamond although not one mine exists on their own soil statistics for last july published by the diamond office show that zimbabwe exported 19 000 carats worth of diamonds rwanda 1 500 and uganda 11 000 the government in kinshasa says the ugandans and rwandans seized 185 216 carats worth of diamonds and 447 kilogrammes of gold during the first eight months of the war

2256300 my parents systematically deforested in order to plant more coffee plants now we know that this was a mistake
2256301 the certification is a mechanism to avoid the slide towards deforestation
2256302 the marketing strategy is to persuade the big certified coffee purchasing groups that this corresponds to demand from consumers sensitized to the question of sustainable development
2256303 one is already seeing the effects of climate change here this year it has not rained very much and if that continues we are going to have problems
2256304 by finding ways to embed offsets in our daily life even something as simple as downloading software we will create permanent reductions in energy use and have a huge impact on our environment and resource sustainability
2256305 we have the ability and in fact the responsibility to bring pc power management to a much broader audience
2256306 if just one percent of all pcs used edison we could potentially reduce environmental impacts by seven billion pounds of co2 which is equal to taking more than a half million cars off the road
2256307 implementing pc energy management solutions at home and in the workplace is a vital component of climate protection
2256308 anyone using a notebook computer is very familiar with the pc going to sleep so that it can extend battery life
2256309 what we find though is that when using a desktop computer or even when the notebook is plugged into the wall the typical user stops thinking about power management
2256310 and a lot of people who do know about it are intimidated about changing their pc settings
2256311 you set policies to reduce power consumption and then forget it
2256312 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2256313 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2256314 the administrator didnt mention anything to the governor about the livestock industry
2256315 however is that the result of the renewable fuels standard mandate our conclusion is no
2256316 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
2256317 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2256318 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate
2256319 continue to plan for and meet the fuel and food needs of the future

2256413 the local community is no more engaged with the communities first process than it was before the review and key local service provider organisations remain disengaged
2256414 the long running situation in west rhyl bears little resemblance to practice anywhere else in the programme and does not accord with the principles set out in the communities first guidance
2256415 discussions have started across the welsh assembly government to consider how community regeneration in this area can be incorporated in a wider programme of economic and social regeneration in rhyl
2256416 the job of making communities first sustainable in rhyl was made all the more difficult by denbighshire county councils lack of commitment to its goals
2256417 the authority has drastically cut the community development agency after actively instructing it to avoid communities first
2256418 this typifies the lack of engagement experienced in rhyl thus stalling efforts to rejuvenate the scheme
2256419 denbighshire expresses disappointment that the communities first programme for west rhyl has been unsuccessful but we are pleased to hear that this money will not be lost to rhyl

2256426 in retrospective studies toddler diarrhoea has been found in children consuming very low fat diets to prevent coronary artery disease on very high fluid intake and with high fluid osmolality i n a randomised trial of children with a recent diagnosis of toddler diarrhoea who were free from symptoms after dietary advice only reintroduction of normal clear apple juice resulted in the recurrence of diarrhoea these children could tolerate cloudy apple juice cloudy juice is bottled immediately after pressing whereas clear apple juice is industrially prepared by means of enzymatic treatment of the apple pulp to obtain a higher yield and an attractive clear product the products therefore differ in the amount of dietary fibre and the amounts of indigestible monosaccharides and oligosaccharides in developed countries the diet of children especially of infants and toddlers has changed dramatically over the past years paediatricians and other physicians are increasingly consulted not only for toddler diarrhoea but also for other health problems related to these changes ready made products increasingly replace food prepared fully by parents here new nutritional habits originate that go together with an increase in affluence drinking plain water is out of vogue it has largely been replaced by fruit juice and squash drinks are consumed on a more or less constant basis often by a drinking bottle they provide a high number of calories and may diminish the appetite reports from the united states indicate that these mainly carbohydrate containing fluids contribute to unbalanced nutrition in clinical practice we encounter young children having excess juice consumption as a contributing factor in non organic failure to thrive in a cross sectional sample of healthy young children excess fruit juice consumption was associated with short stature and obesity frequently drinking fruit juice results in a high fluid intake with displacement of fat and fibre from the diet more parents seem to be concerned with obesity and intend to offer low calorie drinks not being aware of the fact that because of its high carbohydrate content fruit juice equals the caloric content of many popular dairy products fat intake should be increased to at least 35 even 40 of total energy intake restoration of a pattern with well defined meals and snacks provides the opportunity for significant increases of fibre intake fruit juices in particular clear apple juice and other squashes should be limited to restore appetite at meal times drinks between meals are acceptable but overconsumption should be discouraged in almost all patients the efficacy of these dietary measures is such that it may even serve as a confirmation of the diagnosis it is evident that toddler diarrhoea is worrisome for many parents it is a condition related to modern affluent societies where new nutritional practices have emerged related to these changes clinicians see children with toddler diarrhoea nutritional deficiencies and even manifest failure to thrive with stunting the long term health effects remain uncertain

2256428 it makes it imperative that we run a successful program here and i think as long as we have a successful basketball program well have people in our arena

2256433 the process for approving new owners is critically important to the success and long term stability of the nba as it ensures that the proposed owner will conduct the operations of the team only in conformity with the rules and regulations of the league and will possess the economic resources and managerial skills to the successful operation of a member of the nba
2256434 the relief requested by plaintiffs is entirely inconsistent with these reasonable and lawful regulations of the nba and the disposition of this action therefore threatens the ability of the league to protect its justifiable interests
2256435 we have to make good decisions every day every day in the nba teams make decisions that can affect the future of your franchise
2256436 we have to be consistent with how we make our decisions i wouldnt necessarily put a timeline on it in x amount of years we are going to be here our focus is just getting better every day and finding a way to improve every day

2256481 as we survey all the evidence the thought insistently arises that some supernatural agency or rather agency must be involved is it possible that suddenly without intending to we have stumbled upon scientific proof of the existence of a supreme being was it god who stepped in and so providentially crafted the cosmos for our benefit

2256483 there is no intelligent design in the natural world when mammals die they are really and truly dead no ultimate foundations for ethics exist no ultimate meaning in life exists and free will is merely a human myth these are all conclusions to which darwin came quite clearly
2256484 a common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics as well as with chemistry and biology and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature the numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question

2256486 if you think what i write is about you then it must be true

2256489 if i were to pick out the most ridiculous vaccine available on the market today id have to say that this one would be up there at the top
2256490 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children
2256491 i agree with ted thompson that this is a gut wrenching situation for the organization and the fans
2256492 the poll results clearly indicate that nearly 75 percent want brett to remain with the packers but they are split on whether or not he should start
2256493 these results are much more meaningful than a poll which takes a sample of opinion
2256494 everytime you see this type of heavy response to a survey it is a clear indication that the beliefs being expressed are deeply held
2256495 it also is an indication that the green bay packers and brett favre are considered to be a big part of the fabric of that community
2256496 hey coach lewis werent you cleaning up this teams character
2256497 who gives the packers the best chance to win right now

2256509 over the years the enamel thins to reveal the naturally yellow dentin the underlying tooth structure
2256510 im anxious to know what theyre finally going to be the colors nobody knows anything about that
2256511 i think the team probably has a plan of how they want this to roll out accordingly and well certainly do whatever they want us to do
2256512 knowing the timelines that were under i could envision us launching the name first just because maybe we want to start selling tickets or maybe there are some marketing vehicles that require the name first and then the logo sometime thereafter and then the uniform last
2256513 weve got lots and lots of names so we feel like we have absorbed much of the flavor of what the citizens have considered and have certainly put that into the equation
2256514 he used words that would allow the designer to go down a path that i think will get us there faster
2256515 certainly once we have the name and you put the name with the emotions and the feelings and these competitive nature types of ideals that he wants to instill in this team
2256516 i think its all just accelerated theres nothing thats going to be compromised
2256517 if we can allow the fans to embrace us by showcasing heres the name and in a few weeks we launch the logo and the colors and then a few weeks after that the uniform that may be the best direction
2256518 but well talk to the team and well strategize accordingly
2256519 if you had 10 hours warning from a practical point of view you could evacuate populations you could certainly get people out of buildings you could get the fire department ready

2256521 children are at a dynamic stage of brain development hence infection at this stage can have devastating effects on mental functions later in life
2256522 the breakthrough here is that the je virus prevents neural stem and progenitor cells in the brain from dividing it hangs them up
2256523 its the first time that a mosquito borne virus has ever been shown to affect neural stem cells
2256524 humor occurs when the brain recognizes a pattern that surprises it and that recognition of this sort is rewarded with the experience of the humorous response an element of which is broadcast as laughter
2256525 it is not the content of the stimulus but the patterns underlying it that provide the potential for sources of humor for patterns to exist it is necessary to have some form of content but once that content exists it is the level of the pattern at which humor operates and for which it delivers its rewards
2256526 we are trying to understand what kind of genes caused the enormous increase in fruit size and variation in fruit shape as tomatoes were domesticated
2256527 once we know all the genes that were selected during that process we will be able to piece together how domestication shaped the tomato fruit and gain a better understanding of what controls the shape of other very diverse crops such as peppers and the cucumber and squash family
2256528 im not sure but they would certainly look nice in a salad

2256535 we needed a strong company with a history of being able to execute strong campaigns with an excellent number of employees being both educated and entertained verticportals depth of experience level of professionalism and ability to come up with innovative solutions to our problems meant that they were the obvious choice their clever edutainment approach really resonated and grabbed our attention meaning that we were able to succeed in our dual goals of generating awareness as well as generating demand
2256536 creating an educational tool is not enough it does not matter if you are a fortune 500 company employee or a member of the general public you want to be entertained online or you lose interest with the targeted campaign material hence we injected rich media to let the customer be both engaged and informed the appointment is a clear indication of how successful our edutainment solution has proven to be already in generating the tangible results harman strives for
2256537 our focus is on led lighting products and fixtures that can directly replace existing incandescent fluorescent and halogen bulbs in any household or commercial application
2256538 the extendlite led lights provide consumers with more versatility and make it easier to do so
2256539 leds can last up to 100 000 plus hours approximately 11 years and operate more than 20 times longer than the equivalent incandescent lamp
2256540 savings from reduced maintenance costs and downtime quickly return the capital investment expenditure and led lamps require 80 90 less operating power than their incandescent equivalents making them as friendly to the environment as they are to the operating budget
2256541 the e waste industry is still in its infancy which means all stakeholders can take an active role in defining the framework and working relationships to make it a collaborative program
2256542 now that the greenetwork is operating statewide it represents a great solution for retailers manufacturers and collectors who need a program that can address all their locations across california
2256543 were expecting that our collector partners in in southern california will see the same level of success as those with whom we work in the northern part of the state
2256544 as a member of the greenetwork we provide a service to our community that benefits everyone in a variety of ways we are a free drop spot for electronic waste this benefits our residential and commercial community by providing a free and easy way to dispose of e waste and benefits our environment by keeping this material from our landfills
2256545 the greenetwork program has helped us see an increase in the amount of calls for e waste donation pick ups and drop offs at our four thrift stores in san mateo county almost weekly i myself receive calls from people who said they found our contact information on the greenetwork website had it not been for that site they would not have known we accept e waste what callers have been glad to hear is that by donating their e waste to saint vincent de paul they receive a tax deductible donation form from us and that the funds generated from this program help support our services for the needy of san mateo county
2256546 powerpay plus is unique because it is a more convenient and hassle free way for businesses to earn extra revenue
2256547 this program allows our customers the freedom to decide what how much and when they want to curtail
2256548 the anticipated impact of the electric security plans would be a one two punch to customers wallets as any rate increases would be on the heels of the higher distribution rates proposed by most of ohios major electric and natural gas utilities
2256549 these are dire times for many residential consumers and well beyond just those with low incomes
2256550 the decisions made in the coming months through public utilities commission of ohio rules and the utilities proposed rate plans will determine future rate increases we need accountability that the money being requested by the utilities is fair and reasonable the occ will continue to work as part of the ohio consumer and environmental advocates and stands ready to protect the interests of residential consumers
2256551 this is uncharted territory in terms of how rates are being set which highlights the need for the occ to protect consumers from any unjustified rate increases
2256552 while traditional rate cases involve a year long process consideration of the electric security plans is on a faster timeline

2256554 marketing innovations in this industry are critical to reaching our goals of reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from buildings
2256555 we know that this study will allow us to help our members find profitable new business opportunities in the rapidly growing green building industry yudelson associates will come up with a broad based industry analysis and a profile of the most immediate market opportunities for the electrical distributor
2256556 our goal is to talk to and hear from both the mom and pop small distributor as well as to larger regional and national chains
2256557 we hope to outline not only the market growth and profitable openings for electrical distributors but also the best practices in responding to them
2256558 with the growing worldwide trend towards energy conservation national is pleased to support premier farnells global live edge design competition with its powerwise

2256591 will become real one day im certain of this because there is no place for the state of israel on this land
2256592 why should we disarm the militants while the palestinian territories are still occupied the people have to defend themselves

2256600 the possibilities are endless and it may not even be one of the characters who is leaving

2256616 prescribers should be aware of the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when simvastatin is prescribed with amiodarone and they should avoid doses of simvastatin greater than 20 mg per day in patients taking amiodarone
2256617 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute their readings
2256618 now we know some of the real implications of this that these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
2256619 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumors coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
2256620 the least we can do is find a way to level the playing field when it comes to diagnostic tools
2256621 yeah im drunk i know that you hate to be lied to so im telling you the truth i mean i could tell you that im not feeling well but i wont lie to you im drunk

2256634 chris mooney does refuting deniers only strengthen and empower them
2256635 but obviously some debunking must occur or else the myths go unchallenged the trick is as much as possible to focus on the truth and not on repeating the lie this is sometimes a difficult principle to live by and so it always bears repeating
2256636 even though they had arbitrarily placed that label on it
2256637 when people find a claim familiar because of prior exposure but do not recall the original context or source of the claim they tend to think that the claim is true
2256638 if someone says i did not harass her i associate the idea of harassment with this person

2256653 the louder they scream the better things are going for us
2256654 i dont see much in your educational background relating to the earth sciences
2256655 1 parading each weather anomaly as a sign doom convinces no one
2256656 3 so does the use of phoney fraudulent methodology and censorship e g tar mann curve etc how often do we bring that up
2256657 4 you have to accept what the scientific data say if they say theres a lot more to be learned then you have to accept that science has nothing to do with favouring an ideology its all about getting down to the truth
2256658 what are the 2 3 or 4 whatever arguments that convince you humans are causing or about to cause catastrophic global warming
2256659 mr x your arguments were refuted long ago and well waste no more time on them

2256662 there has recently been a surge in people running for school boards in order to influence the teaching or non teaching of evolution or creationism what are your thoughts on the teaching of these two subjects in public schools
2256663 i have no designs on either issue as neither is part of my platform but i do believe in balance and if one subject is taught the opposing view should also get attention ultimately parents should discuss religion with their children as it is a personal choice the debate over creationism versus evolution goes back decades and is now part of our american history a student needs to know that history to make an intelligent choice about how they view religion
2256664 how many people have actually seen the science of heliocentricism
2256665 there are some largish gaps in my understanding of agw for the moment im willing to take those matters on trust see the meta reason a above but i would like to ask on this blog and in other places the problem is that the whole discussion has become so polarized that there is a risk of even simple questions being taken the wrong way maybe i ought to read joes book first
2256666 dr climatescience you state in your paper that thusinsuch is likely can you in fact prove that thusinsuch is true
2256667 no im not at all claiming that this proves agw isnt happening but it does raise doubts even dr climatescience admits that his models are incomplete at this point we cant prove the science one way or the other thats precisely the problem and why it would be dangerous to harm the economy until we have done more research
2256668 this is so far out of my comfort zone and i am loving it
2256669 we at code factory have always realized that mobile devices have the potential to give blind and visually impaired users unprecedented access to reading material wherever they are
2256670 mobile daisy player has a unique role to play in allowing access to books from many different sources on many different mobile phones a short time ago a blind or visually impaired user was at a distinct disadvantage in that he she had to carry large braille volumes many cassette tapes or a specialized player if he she wished to read on the go with mobile daisy player however a blind or visually impaired user with a daisy book has an even more portable method of reading than his her sighted colleagues since he she can carry many books on a mobile phone which he she would be carrying in any case
2256671 people think of ai and they think of brains in boxes or
2256672 what ais done by trying to set itself lofty goals about understanding how to build intelligent software or flexible software its produced along the way tonnes of methods and insights that are now routinely deployed everywhere
2256673 what ai is much more about is micro intelligence its lots of little places where programs are popping up with a very limited capability but in its own area its pretty smart
2256674 theres all of these little programs that give you the impression of thinking oh thats pretty smart how does it know my taste or preference its using a bit of ai technology and presenting it in a useful way
2256675 what were seeing with the web is the way in which it can bring those things that computers are good at in co ordination with what people are good at you use peoples innate intelligence and ability you connect them up on planetary scale and youve got a new kind of assisted intelligence it isnt an ai because its not in any way self aware but its a phenomenal powerful thing
2256676 they are basically the lower level stuff and weve become pretty good at that but in truth building humanoid intelligence is a millennia long enterprise in my view
2256677 they wont be having debates with you about philosophy or they wont be worrying about their own self existence
2256678 as far as i know its the earliest recording of a computer playing music in the world probably by quite a wide margin
2256679 thats where the whole computer music thing started but they were not the first to have a computer play music
2256680 it played music months or weeks before the manchester recording
2256681 word must have got around that this electronic brain could play music
2256682 my understanding is that chris strachey got on and wrote a program for playing draughts and when the program terminated it played god save the king
2256683 at the time of the recording outside broadcasts were recorded on to acetate disks
2256684 you can hear the presenter tell the recording engineer in the van lift jim and that meant lift the cutter off to stop recording
2256685 it would perform any task within its capacity depending on what program was put in
2256686 that particular program was devised solely to make the machine work very hard so we could see where it was about to go wrong
2256687 if you gave the problem to a mathematician he would take a fraction of a second to give you an answer
2256688 there is a wealth of information to be shared about italys art culture and history
2256689 using standard keyword search that information remains buried but expert systems semantic search and retrieval can understand the concept of a users question in colloquial and jargon format and deliver relevant information from the data bank to the user in multiple languages
2256690 the results clearly show that drivers skills are far less impacted when they use speech recognition systems than when they take their eyes off the road to interact with their devices
2256691 in conversations with carriers where we have shared the study results they all express optimism that including speech recognition will help ensure their customers can continue to safely use their mobile devices
2256692 more comprehensive speech support for command and control and network feature access is shipping on blackberry devices from sprint and rogers
2256693 whats cool is that they built character into it though then you buy a 99 wall e robot but they dont work particularly hard to give it personality and as much as i love my iphone theres no chance its going to love me back
2256694 is about robots that can trigger emotional responses in people or even look like they have human like emotions themselves
2256695 people have an expectation of what a dog or cat will behave like its more difficult to suspend your disbelief when youre looking at something thats like but isnt a dog or cat its easier with a dinosaur
2256696 once i had the initial prototype up and running and i had a hexapod that could see and respond to the people it met it became a short jump to allow it to remember them too
2256697 once ic has locked on to a persons face ive programmed it to wait a short time and then capture that face as a digital photo the robot has an internet connection so as soon as it has met someone and remembered them or rather taken their photo it publishes the image to its blog
2256698 pleo is about an emotional relationship and a bond the endgame is the next generation interface its the difference between r2 d2 in star wars and commander data in star trek the next generation r2 d2 is limited in its interface but if you get the interface right then we can explore the whole depth of the machine its not that people dont want to use all their machines capabilities its that the barrier to use is too great so our philosophy is really to breathe life into any machine
2256699 maybe the next one will be emotional and not entertainment
2256700 one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it
2256701 i look more and more like a turtle every day
2256702 i never gave up my dreams to become a singer
2256703 liams sights are set firmly on getting back the factory and booting tony out
2256704 after nearly five years of wearing matthews suits every morning and having to shave every day i feel ready to pull on some bermuda shorts and grow a goatee
2256705 but ive had a brilliant time at emmerdale and im excited about what lies ahead
2256706 he committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth
2256707 a week or two before maybe two weeks gradually move them over from a summer schedule to a school schedule
2256708 if we leave you alone well be dragging you out of bed
2256709 youre fighting human nature here by making some of these kids get up early
2256710 it really means some very strict control of the environment
2256711 work with the school board to change the start times
2256712 the cognitive impairment during the biological night was twice as large as during the normal time of awakening the biological morning
2256713 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
2256714 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
2256715 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
2256716 this is a broader and more important collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models
2256717 the cells will allow researchers access for the first time to cell types of interest to watch the disease progress in a dish to watch what goes right or wrong well see in the years ahead that this opens the door to a new way of treating degenerative disease
2256718 that is where all of the science will go on over the next many many years
2256719 even though the ips methodology gives us a facile way for making disease specific lines it does not eliminate the value or need for continuing to study
2256720 those are really the gold standard for pluripotent stem cell types they have no genetic modifications and at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue beyond that are going to be extremely valuable tools human embryonic stem cells allow you to ask questions that we never can ask with ips cells
2256721 whether or not were going to be able to figure out how to do it without viruses so we can use the cells therapeutically is as of today an unanswered question
2256722 im confident were going to get there and that within the next year or two we will have several strategies for reprogramming cells without viruses and when that happens we may have cells in our hands that may be valuable for cell replacement therapy
2256723 in these complex genetic diseases were so ignorant at the moment we dont even know if patients who get type 1 diabetes all get it the same way there could be 50 different ways to get
2256724 aligned to omgs programmer oriented vision in which models are just a more efficient way for developers to generate code
2256725 an egee comparative study grid and clouds evolution or revolution
2256726 of course part of the problem with redheads is that there arent enough of them they make up just two percent of the population so theyre pretty extraordinary redheads are too numerous to be ignored too rare to be accepted
2256727 i love being a redhead its a rare thing so i think theres a bond between redheads
2256728 once in his life every man is entitled to fall madly in love with a gorgeous redhead
2256729 youd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair
2256730 people who havent red hair dont know what trouble is
2256731 nobody who has known a redhead can say that redheads are tame
2256732 i do believe my redheadedness plays a huge part in who i am if i were a blonde or brunette i would be an entirely different person
2256733 we redheads are a minority we tend to notice each other you know and notice our identity
2256734 all throughout history from reuben to robbins redheads have been recognized as a rare breed
2256735 while the rest of the species is descended from apes redheads are descended from cats
2256736 its not the hair that turns men on its the spirit that redheads exude
2256737 when a fellow has a home and a dear little red haired wife in it what more need he ask of life
2256738 gentlemen may prefer blondes but it takes a real man to handle a redhead
2256739 out of the ash i rise with my red hair and eat men like air
2256740 i used to hate my red hair but now i love the attention i get with it i think that very smart daring men love red hair and i love that in a man
2256741 redheads have been nicknamed demons by my associates and i because of what they can do to the human heart best thing thats hit the earth ever never had too much luck with them though advice is accepted
2256742 the attraction to redheads is a lot like being addicted to drugs
2256743 redheaded people are highly intelligent they have many admiers and marry young
2256744 vuja de happens when you enter a situation youve been in a thousand times before but with the sense of being there for the first time the term was originally coined by bob sutton
2256745 this guy i really like gave me the best compliment
2256746 the best way to make an arab man fall down on his knees is to bring a beautiful chubby women to mesmirize him
2256747 im always against the conspiracy theory but it is not a secret that arabs have been a target for zionist propaganda which you just unintentionally circulated
2256748 if three men with different nationalities were at a bar and a beautiful woman past by which one of those men is most likely to drool and fall off the stool
2256749 you cant get married unless you get fortification under the consent of the king
2256750 you need to get f u c k to get married
2256751 we had to sit on the floor in front of the tv for dinner and then her uncle came in and yelled at me and said wa7ry ya 7emara
2256752 shell never want to come over to our house ever again
2256753 well ill be damned this is a sign of the times since when do you americans know about such things unless you worked for the us goverment when i was studying in the states you guys didnt know where kuwait was let alone if i was shee3a or sunna
2256754 well we dont want to be accused of being arrogant or ignorant we oughta know about such things
2256755 so i suppose it would be perfectly normal to be at a party in the states and ask a girl you just met if she was jewish or catholic i think i prefer you guys being ignorant
2256756 favre has been a terrible quarterback in the playoffs for the latter part of his career
2256757 the main thing is the man has shown no respect to perhaps the greatest quarterback in their franchise history bretts a little disappointed he feels like he can still play he knows he can still play
2256758 when its all said and done ted thompson is the man to blame on all this
2256759 ive been really busy with work and stuff you know 7areem receptions and stuff
2256760 weee 7asafa kint mo3jaba o al7een sa7abt e3jabee kilah too bad
2256761 suppressed women in the middle east who bitch about men in blogs then again maybe we should let her and then sue her and add another million to our bank account yaaay more shopping
2256762 specialist teachers acting as proselytes and high priests of the movement
2256763 clearly i am talking about a movement of moral reform
2256764 us frogs are really very friendly plus we eat all the things you dont like
2256765 replace underscores with hyphens in search engine results words separated by underscores will run together while hypens will create a space between each word
2256766 revise your site to ensure that people know exactly what the next step is if you want a visitor to click a link tell them
2256767 if people think god is interesting the onus is on them to show that there is anything there to talk about otherwise they should just shut up about it
2256768 but its also one ive come to question first of all what is the point of fighting and debating climate skeptics any more
2256769 if so it follows that the defenders of climate science ought to be at least as leery of outright engagement with heartland as the defenders of evolutionary science are when it comes to engaging with discovery
2256770 fox newss highly publicized lawsuit against al franken surely helped sell copies of lies and the lying liars who tell them so why wouldnt repeated critiques by environmental groups of someone like say bjorn lomborg or the heartland institute do exactly the same thing
2256771 you realize that all of these things cannot be repeated in milwaukee right
2256772 so dont you get your hopes up if i call because i always catch myself when i fall but i got to admit that im a little bit in love with you
2256773 so far one thing thats very clear is this is very much the group rod wants to go forward with i think that says a lot
2256774 it appears all the coaches and all the players are on the same page and buying into rods system
2256775 we havent had that in the past weve had some talented players but they often were either selfish or didnt buy into what the coaching staff was doing
2256776 a lot of it will depend on how the team does
2256777 late in the season if were in the hunt people are going to want to see us
2256778 the first rule of getting better is to show up to work
2256779 we do not choose to be born we do not choose our parents we don not choose our historical epoch the country of our birth or the immediate circumstances of our upbringing we do not most of us choose to die nor do we choose a time and conditions of our death but within this realm of choicelessness we do choose how we shall live courageously or in cowardice honorably or dishonorably with purpose or in drift we decide what is trivial in life we decide that what makes us significant either what we do or what we refuse to do but no matter how indifferent the universe may be to our choices and decisions these choices and decisions are ours to make we decide we choose and as we decide and choose so are our lives our formed in the end forming our own destiny is what ambition is about
2256780 i just wanted a long term deal and they wanted me to wait a year
2256781 i told them i thought i deserved it right now
2256782 it is big to have players like dwight and brian with us this year
2256783 those are players that we can trust on the field and that can help us teach the system
2256784 the fact that we know the system is obviously a help with the learning curve here
2256785 it is still an adjustment but in this league every year is a new adjustment whether you change teams or not
2256786 these days with all of the offseason activities you get a lot more time with your teammates before the season
2256787 ive been here since march because this is now a 10 month a year job its not just six months like it used to be in the 60s and 70s
2256788 ive been able to work with the other safeties and give them some ideas and i know brian has been able to do that with the corners
2256789 i can help the corners but im also talking to the safeties
2256790 its too bad it would have been nice for us to finish off the game
2256791 but the idea is to improve from the first preseason game to the second weve got a lot to work on
2256792 obviously weve got some work to do but thats what the preseason is for
2256793 it was good to go up against a different defense and it was good to see the receivers in live action
2256794 i wish he had gotten a chance to finish it off
2256795 we had plenty of time and he had us in great position
2256796 when we have good protection the turnovers are going to go down when youre not under duress you have the ability to make better decisions
2256797 the key to everything is running the ball its hard work but we have to stay at it
2256798 i liked the way he moved the ball down the field
2256799 it maximizes how to facilitate what i want to experiment with and serves the exploration of the play
2256800 this is something far different from a walking talking android
2256801 this piece of technology is an enabler of the old concept of more direct communication between audience and performer i am so engaged about when we want the audience to affect the play and when we dont
2256802 its a deep play a complex play its very funny his takes on issues are very often unserious
2256803 its important for me to do cymbeline without making a feminist statement and to see the parallels to our own government this is a ruler who has many inadequacies and makes many mistakes he does not come through the journey to knowledge a la king lear
2256804 it is a deeply experimental play shakespeare was using in new ways things he had combined or made conventions of his own work
2256805 our interest is to take a familiar technology and hijack it for other purposes
2256806 its not a pick your own ending but a technological mediation between the actors and the audience
2256807 i am so engaged about when we want the audience to affect the play and when we dont
2256808 im getting older and looser i dont feel so reverential
2256809 wow the iscl has really taken her own advice from yesterday to heart
2256810 in 24 hours its gone from 1 55 to 1 50 which is highly unusual that changes your game plan for the marketplace
2256811 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2256812 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2256813 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2256814 lots of investors have been on high commodity prices and a low dollar and those bets are getting destroyed
2256815 want to highlight the good as well as raise some questions about coverage that we believe has some holes in it most of all we want to try to create a clearning house of information and opinion on this topic this is what blogs do best
2256816 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2256817 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2256818 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the marketplace
2256819 just going against a different jersey different players different coverages different schemes just try to test your mind a little bit
2256820 its been a year since i played a game and being the first one out there is a little nerve racking with matt and stuff
2256821 everyone im going out there with theyre all going to help me and i feel confident in that
2256822 its just an opportunity for me to show what i can do
2256823 its a very tough challenge coming in and having to run with the first team all the time and now going against two of the best d tackles in the game
2256824 two pro bowl guys from last year thats a tough first game its a welcome we realize its a challenge and were going to play as a team and help him out
2256825 its all good and i hope the players know that as nice as everything is thats not going to win us many games
2256826 we have the best facility in football now and i want them to enjoy it its very player friendly but then we cant get too caught up in that we still have a lot of hard work to do
2256827 i had been here with the kingdome and ive been here with the new stadium so to be able to be blessed to see this its great
2256828 we might even get to walk through the whole thing
2256829 a lot of times you talk to a lot of free agents and a lot of them want to see the facilities and what the team has to offer
2256830 the players desks it was the old school desk they would stick to the players as they would walk to their meetings with the desk attached to them and the coaching staff we had our offensive staff and coach bill walsh in one room basically
2256831 its so different but the game has changed the money has changed the stadiums have changed the nfl is a really big business and im very proud of our city and everyone that put this whole thing together and allowed us to do this its fabulous
2256832 one or two seconds can separate an olympic athlete and the rest of the world
2256833 i dont know if it will be an advantage or a disadvantage
2256834 we havent even talked about it yet to be honest i dont think i am going to be able to hear anything anyway with all the noise at qwest field but if they pumped music into that thing the other team might be in trouble
2256835 hes a great little guy a tough guy and im pulling for him
2256836 we were traveling one time i get all the way to my hotel room i find i have a 10 pound weight in my book bag i thought my book bag was kind of heavy and i was like what is this weight doing in here they made me carry it all the way back to the weight room i was going to get fined if i didnt bring it back
2256837 they told me saturday and it hit me like a ton of breaks
2256838 i thought it would be another week of rehab and id be back on the field ive been a guy that plays through pain and injuries when they told me i was done it was pretty hard for the first day and a half
2256839 i am deeply sorry i really look at myself as a person who has high integrity and high character
2256840 to have these errors in judgment is not my character im sorry to put my family my friends and the seahawks through this
2256841 but i cant go out to dinner or to the mall or anything like that
2256842 its been tough one of the toughest things ive ever had to go through
2256843 theres a perception out there i have a problem theres a perception out there that i have two duis theres a perception out there that there is this wild guy driving around seattle drunk
2256844 but i have no one to blame but myself for that
2256845 pretty much the writing is on that wall that its going to be that way its kind of like three strikes and youre out
2256846 i really dont but like i said you never know i wanted to get professionals to see
2256847 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck rick davis mr
2256848 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me mr
2256849 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
2256850 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
2256851 we wanted to encourage our employees to take more steps towards sustainability and one way to do that is to provide an example to them
2256852 we intend to use zap trucks at one of our larger facilities so the employees can use them to get around to our different water collectors
2256853 we would like to congratulate the sonoma county water agency for stepping up and being a leader in this era of record gas and oil prices and helping to put more electric vehicles on the road in
2256854 the renewable energy credits recs offered in the state of for this type of project created an outstanding investment opportunity for mc gowan builders the recs combined with deprecation the federal tax credit and the finance package they chose will produce a positive cash flow for the company within the first year and drive the effective cost of the system down significantly
2256855 we selected csss 800 000 solar energy system for mc gowan builders new headquarters building as an investment in the future the future of our firm and the future of our planet css provided a solution that satisfied both our cost and performance requirements the photovoltaic panels will reduce energy production related carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 144 000 pounds annually this investment is a part of mgbs environmental initiatives that incorporate green construction practices as well as design and building systems solutions that will result in leed points for the companys new headquarters
2256856 if you get a tv and you dont have a way to install it it obviously affects the satisfaction rate with that purchase
2256857 so we decided to get into offering installation packages online
2256858 when you make it harder for illegal immigrants to get work you force them to take riskier measures
2256859 we expect them to ensure individuals they hire are legal to the best of their knowledge
2256860 were put in a situation where we have to be a detective
2256861 the only way to help with this situation is if the irs sends us a letter then we can investigate
2256862 i made a lot of paper copies and sent big letters
2256863 we contacted 50 senators 30 government departments and two governors
2256864 my wife would jump every time the phone rang in the middle of the night she would wake up afraid and just sit up in bed
2256865 we abide and live by the laws set forth in checking job applicants papers
2256866 parents are supposed to take their child to the pediatrician every year and that happens till theyre about age six
2256867 then parents start forgetting pediatricians dont nag them and schools dont require it
2256868 a parent would have that gut instinct that this isnt a simple flu but a sorority sister or a roommate might not realize it
2256869 we got her to the hospital in 40 minutes and her veins were collapsing i was still thinking she had the flu and theyre telling me she has a 50 chance of living
2256870 my son was an honor student pre med gorgeous happy
2256871 we went through 26 days where we saw his hands and feet turn black as the gangrene set in he lost his kidney function and his liver function and had 10 hours of grand mal seizures and to think that all this could have been prevented with a vaccine that we just didnt know about thats why its so important to get the message out now
2256872 this the first time we have ever given adolescents multiple vaccines where are the studies that look at whether or not this is a healthy thing to do over the long term
2256873 you have a 20 fold greater chance of getting meningococcal meningitis without the vaccine than of getting gbs from the vaccine and even if you get gbs youll likely recover statistically the choice is very clear
2256874 isnt always at the top of peoples priorities or kids say oooh i dont like shots
2256875 but people need to know that this exists and by the way you can prevent it
2256876 its one of the very rare bits of valuable heritage of the communist regime
2256877 its kind of like monica had two lives with two families
2256878 from a social standpoint its very hard on the animal
2256879 they are members of the family and you do have a special bond with them
2256880 until we can get a better understanding on how this legislation may affect future growth
2256881 and there are smaller numbers of people involved in the animals life
2256882 it makes you feel good about the world around you
2256883 it may be a short bond but its a real bond
2256884 there is tremendous market interest for plastics derived from renewable sustainable sources
2256885 major retailers consumer product companies and the packaging and plastics industries are working together to implement solutions to lessen our dependence upon foreign oil and to reduce global warming the utilization of sugar cane ethanol as a chemical feedstock is the next logical step after its use as an alternative fuel
2256886 in recent weeks reports by diverse organizations such as fao oxfam the world bank the u s federal reserve and now the oecd highlight the vital role that brazilian sugarcane ethanol has in emission reduction as well as economic development through competition not subsidies or trade distortions gasoline is now the alternative fuel in as drivers choose lower costs and less emissions with sugarcane ethanol
2256887 if the facility is determined to get someone out its generally not that hard to do it in an assisted living facility
2256888 theres not much law so they get to do what they want
2256889 across the board involuntary discharge numbers have risen in recent years
2256890 its really hard to know how many folks were simply told we think you need to find another place for your mother
2256891 people get lost people dont know which side of the bed to get out of or where the bathroom is
2256892 you could see the panicky look in his eyes everything was strange
2256893 thats what theyre all doing right now is building up these recovery rehab units
2256894 your facility is not ceasing to operate as you are not surrendering your license
2256895 we had to pick the one that best met the circumstances
2256896 i think it would kill her if she couldnt see my sister
2256897 theres probably a facility somewhere that can provide mr oconnor with the treatment and the care that he needs
2256898 could contribute to his behavior in the facility if he was having pain
2256899 i believe that theres some nurses there that can really help me out
2256900 admit patients into our facilities that we can properly take care of we do not refuse to take them back
2256901 the conversion of ethanol into chemicals is not a new process or technology some of the first plastics produced were originally made from ethanol due to increasing petroleum costs and global warming this is a now a very compelling eco efficient alternative to traditional petrochemical production
2256902 i am working with zap to bring the products into
2256903 youve never seen the olympics in a market that has such domestic commercial scale
2256904 when the olympics were in los angeles and atlanta the u s market was already fully developed
2256905 were not providing adequate sex education and adequate information about avoiding pregnancies therefore we must do more
2256906 a study released a few years ago by the harvard school of public health compared firearm mortality rates among youngsters 5 to 14 years old in the five states with the highest rates of gun ownership with those in the five states with the lowest rates
2256907 the results were chilling children in the states with the highest rates of gun ownership were 16 times as likely to die from an accidental gunshot wound nearly seven times as likely to commit suicide with a gun and more than three times as likely to be murdered with a firearm
2256908 only a lunatic could seriously believe that more guns in more homes is good for americas children
2256909 for all we ought to have thought and have not thought all we ought to have said and have not said all we ought to have done and have not done i pray thee god for forgiveness
2256910 if one considers the status ascribed to poetry and mathematics by plato one sees how ever since romanticism they have swapped places and conditions
2256911 who will prove to be the strongest the most moderate those who have no need of extreme articles of faith who can think of man with a considerable moderation the richest in health who are equal to the most misfortunes and therefore less afraid of such misfortunes 15
2256912 established itself as a horizontal structure for the historicity of the finitude of existence
2256913 that we do not possess the wherewithal to be atheists so long as theme of finitude governs our thinking
2256914 in the deployment of the romantic figure the infinite which becomes the open as the site for the temporalization for the site of finitude remains beholden to the one because it remains beholden to history as long as finitude remains the ultimate determination of existence god abides he abides as that whose disappearance continues to hold sway over us in the form of the abandonment the dereliction or the leaving behind of being
2256915 does it become possible to think within a radically deconsecrated realm
2256916 on the one hand the ethical pathos of finitude which operates under the banner of death presupposes the infinite through temporalization and cannot dispense with all those sacred precarious and defensive representations concerning the promise of a god who would come to cauterize the indifferent wound which the world inflicts on the romantic trembling of the open
2256917 there is nothing but infinite multiplicity which in turn presents infinite multiplicity and the one and only halting point in this presentation presents nothing ultimately this halting point is the void not the one god is dead at the heart of presentation
2256918 the guy in charge has been here a long time
2256919 but the guy im talking about is jeff fisher hes been here 15 years you know hes been around the block he just always seems to get the most out of this team no matter how chaotic things are
2256920 fired two reporters who were paid 20 000 for collaborating with the national enquirer on an elizabeth smart story because they misled their employer about the level of their involvement with the tabloid
2256921 the story ha d been retracted as part of a settlement between the smart family and the tabloid
2256922 mum about the location of the enquirers photographer the type of camera used its an extremely blurry photo after all and how edwards manages to have the exact same sweat pattern in both photos even though the conditions and shirts might both be different
2256923 banned its bloggers including political bloggers from mentioning the edwards rielle hunter story
2256924 because the only source has been the national enquirer we have decided not to cover the rumors or salacious speculations
2256925 this is not the time for a lot of hype
2256926 its a time to actually go out and prove it
2256927 thats the name of the game i think that the expectations for this team are that they will win
2256928 otherwise you might as well you have to go into each season believing that youre going to win and winning the championship is the goal and it has to be the goal and rod absolutely believes that and believes that well contend for it
2256929 i think ultimately though it will depend on how the team is doing
2256930 if we get off to a good start and were playing exciting football the fans i think will get behind us and if we dont then then they wont
2256931 ive been frustrated with the team for several years so yes ive been extremely frustrated and disappointed not in rod but in the performance of the team but i have great faith in rod
2256932 im not getting into any kind of what ifs and end of the year thatll sort itself out at the end of the year
2256933 because football is ultimately a team game and the difference in talent between teams in the nfl is not very large
2256934 and typically at least over the years that ive seen it the teams that do well are truly well integrated teams that have been together a while and understand what theyre doing as a team and i think rod is forming that now
2256935 and thats what gives me hope is that we really have it appears all the coaches and all the players on the same page buying into rods program i believe that gives me real faith as we go into this season
2256936 we havent had that in the past weve had some talented players but they often were either selfish or didnt buy into whatever the coaching staff was espousing
2256937 i feel very good about our coach and i think ive probably made that clear because i feel good about the coach i feel good about the fact that he has the kind of players that he feels he can win with
2256938 i have no idea looking back why all that happened all the changes that he made
2256939 theres one thing that i still use that he taught me and thats it and that was just changing my grip a little bit and im sure just any coach probably would have come along and changed that a little bit just the difference between an nfl ball and one of those nike college footballs
2256940 i wanted 24 so bad it hurt my heart when i couldnt get it
2256941 too much money i was willing to pay like ten thousand and i heard rumors its going to cost like 50 im aint buying nobody no car now
2256942 hes done it for a lot of years smart high character guy im really kind of anxious to see him get his pads on and go to work
2256943 i discussed that earlier in the year and i dont want to talk about it
2256944 the picture that science fiction fans of every age and in every corner of the world have prayed sometimes forlornly that the industry might some day give them
2256945 almost like having a remote control built into your face
2256946 mundane subjects or those that try a teachers patience would be good for robot teachers
2256947 computers are already powerful enough to sustain useful robots that interact and assist humans in everyday life
2256948 now progress requires a scientific shakedown in goals and methods not unlike the cognitive revolution that occurred 40 years ago
2256949 so in later research when the computer recognizes that a student is perceiving a lecture to be really hard or perceives that the user wants the robot to slow down it will accommodate
2256950 if im a student with a robot teacher and i can say yeah speed up come on i understand you or hey im losing you slow down a second then thats really good really helpful
2256951 if im completely puzzled and yet the robot keeps giving me more information thats not going to be very useful
2256952 its not going to revolutionize the world but its promising
2256953 i was tuning in and out and i thought how much i wished i could get through it a bit quicker
2256954 jakes research is exemplary of the kind of education oriented research that we hope will become an increasing part of the centers research output
2256955 only a human teacher can put their heart into it
2256956 a manager walked in with the letter in his hand laughing saying youre not getting in here
2256957 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all
2256958 mcdonalds clearly continues to be one of the few consistent performers in a challenging consumer sector
2256959 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2256960 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2256961 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
2256962 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2256963 the racketeering charge has really been key to our attack on ms 13 because weve been able to charge a large number of members from the leadership down to the to the low level members
2256964 it was 24 hours just like anyone else does if they have that offense
2256965 i want to apologize to anyone i have let down especially the kids out there its not the right thing to do you shouldnt drink and drive
2256966 ill never forget about it im just glad no one was injured i think ill be a better person for it i already know i have taken great strides
2256967 not necessarily something you want to have associated with your name as ive worked so hard to have my name in a good light im going to do everything i can to earn the trust and respect back to restore it
2256968 its over and done with so im just glad to put that past me and move forward really
2256969 not really it wasnt much for me you know what i mean
2256970 it happened it got over with you know and thats pretty much all i have to say about it really
2256971 my thing is this is such a detailed oriented game if you can put an investment into yourself and it makes it 1 percent better thats pretty significant where the competition is so close
2256972 if it makes you perform like that on sunday you bet ill take two
2256973 thats new stuff for me but if they believe in it and it works for them and their minds telling their body its working why not plus they all make a lot of money so they can probably afford all those little doodads
2256974 ok theres some stuff that is sort of out there that can really help things that you dont really have an answer for
2256975 id knock on the door 10 oclock every night say hello to his wife his kids go down to his basement and go to sleep in his basement in his hyperbaric chamber
2256976 the fact that it still healed up while playing with it on sundays was a good indicator to me
2256977 there is no proven efficacy of these ziploc bags for lack of a better term other than for altitude sickness which is the only use the fda has approved them for
2256978 if psychologically patrick kerney thinks that by having one of these he will bring down 15 more running backs next weekend thats great for him i have no problem with that
2256979 the problem is people read this and think its a true medical solution
2256980 its well known that when you have adrenaline flowing through the blood you are going to be able to do things physically that you are not going to be capable of otherwise
2256981 it certainly allows me to do things physically where i shake my head and say to myself theres no way a calm version of myself would be able to do that
2256982 my dad was asking me the other day what are you going to do with all this stuff when you are done playing
2256983 you always want the ball in your hands but at the end of the day it comes down to victories
2256984 hes making a lot of things happen right now hes been a real surprise coming back into camp
2256985 all you can do is just go out there and thrive off each other and push each other
2256986 so this is what matt hasselbeck goes through every day
2256987 there wasnt much of a choice once they told me the seriousness i couldnt risk being confined to a wheelchair just to play a 16th year
2256988 i have two young kids and a wife who has supported me the whole time it would be fun to spend time with them
2256989 im talking to the team about a marketing deal kind of like the thing you know
2256990 its not for 20 million but a couple hundred gs it would work
2256991 the last two days every time i started talking to someone i started crying
2256992 all of a sudden whoo it just cut off its kind of a shock
2256993 ron heller told me the fastest way out of the nfl is to get hurt
2256994 i always prided myself on being able to play through pain
2256995 regardless of who those guys are out there at wide receiver work the system
2256996 the system works we believe in the system work the system dont even worry about the reps you get with certain guys
2256997 i just have to forget some of that stuff and just throw it to whoever is out there
2256998 i cant say oh when joe jurevicius ran this route or when darrell jackson ran this route or when deion ran this route i gotta just find them and hit them less rhythm and knowing the guy i cant worry about it
2256999 realistically as a quarterback you throw to guys and you get to know the little nuances the things they do where theyre going to be
2257000 so theres a comfort level there but given what happens in any given year youre mixing and matching with whatever happens and i think in years past that has frustrated matt hes a very precise guy its one of the reasons hes good but not everybody is that precise and the fact is he has to throw it to the guy whoever it is
2257001 with bobby with certain routes we have done it so many times that i know before the ball is even snapped how hes going to run his route what hes going to do
2257002 weve talked about it done it for whatever the reason we know what each other is thinking it would be impossible to have that feeling with somebody i havent worked with
2257003 i think my natural tendency would be to feel exactly the way marino felt but as i talk to coach holmgren former seattle quarterbacks coach jim zorn before and new quarterbacks coach bill lazor now they reinforce that you cant get frustrated with anything
2257004 in fact you need to use this as a positive i havent figured out how to do it yet but its part of being a quarterback you have to learn to deal with young guys
2257005 it would be a expletive shame to lose a game because we couldnt get lined up right
2257006 im immune to that by now i dont think theres any nostalgic sense
2257007 thats more the motivation now that its his last year hes not going to let things slip especially this year its not any different its always been like that even when i was in green bay as a practice squad kid watching after three consecutive mvps and after they had gone to two consecutive super bowls he still flips out if its not done right no change whatsoever if any change the bar is set higher
2257008 this was a little different scrimmage than weve had in the past
2257009 we kept a lot of guys out in the scrimmage because we really wanted to look at some people that were competing for maybe not starting positions but certainly the depth of making the football team
2257010 so in fairness to those young guys we set it up a certain way
2257011 i feel like every time you step on the field you have something to prove
2257012 im the biggest back weve got hopefully i bring some power
2257013 it is a lovely area and we are upset about this
2257014 can you believe two occurrences in days this is illegal and its damaging for a very precious resource we have wed like to get to the bottom of it and find the culprits this is outrageous
2257015 you would think it would be done under the cover of darkness but its a secluded community so it wouldnt have to be
2257016 from all the indications at the moment they had an unlikely involvement but we dont want to draw that definite conclusion at the moment
2257017 random victim of identity theft at the hands of major drug traffickers
2257018 this crime was compounded by law enforcement when it illegally invaded the calvo home tied up the mayor and his mother in law and killed the family dogs
2257019 the calvo family is still waiting for an explanation from law enforcement as to how this could possibly have happened
2257020 im in a bad mood i dont want to be in a good mood no signing hymns
2257021 i go to church and i love to hear hymns
2257022 if you dont fix this youre not going to be here
2257023 i was kind of surprised to be honest with you
2257024 and im very thankful for the opportunity and coach holmgren and his staff and the people in the front office for believing in me after going through what i went through last year
2257025 hey its a tough business sometimes if he couldnt handle that little bit with me it gets a lot harder than that
2257026 id been a school teacher for a long time now and so i kind of know how its going to work before i do something at least i think i do i try not to back a player into a corner unless i think im going to get the response i need
2257027 just getting a feel for my surroundings and endurance was the biggest deal being able to last for a while
2257028 really the only thing that prevents him from being very very successful on every play is leonard
2257029 hes strong enough hes fast enough he has great skill he has become a very good blocker
2257030 of course were all competing but ive never gotten sour
2257031 the police did it they did a great job virginia beach is a super safe place to be and i look forward to going back next year
2257032 he says it looks like that guys carrying my surfboard
2257033 he keeps telling me some story then he says i think that is my surfboard
2257034 being an idiot i said sir sir excuse me is that yours
2257035 this did not stop them and in fact they sped up morrogh took off after them
2257036 we may as well just throw all these letters up into the wind
2257037 i dont think theres any doubt in anyones mind that we have a moral and statutory duty to notify people that evidence exists that could prove their innocence
2257038 by choosing to use the mail we are selecting the least reliable method of notification
2257039 i think it will work in many many of the cases in those cases where it doesnt work then we can explore another option
2257040 the players went out before the games to make the field after the game we had to put green paint over the white lines because theyd have another game
2257041 searched for football rules printed it out and learned it
2257042 i think were out of the crawling stage i think maybe now were in baby steps
2257043 hes very raw behind in experience hes an extra bonus spot his reps will be very very limited
2257044 having him here may not affect the nfl this generation but in the next generation he may go home and spread the nfl game there
2257045 its much like the globalization of basketball that has already happened
2257046 the key to maintaining our impressive growth is to continue building out our national footprint and educating the local markets about interclicks unique targeting and transparency

2257073 ethanol from corn has had a modest impact on the volume of oil imported into the u s and has marginally stabilized the price of gasoline but a less expensive form of ethanol can significantly impact the marketplace and reduce tailpipe emissions
2257074 our best opportunity to enter the solar market is with products aimed at a specialty market solar energy is now developing so fast that it has become difficult for a small company to gain a foothold without a specific advantage in a niche market as we combine mantras financial strength and vision and the technical expertise to be built into nextgen we can quickly bring our products to consumers
2257075 shifts from physical to digital will disrupt the marginal economics of the tv and movie businesses just as it did for music

2257077 many products such as security software are viewed as essential by corporate tech buyers
2257078 the business environment in which sony operates is changing rapidly and with the advance in digital technology and broadband networks technological innovation is moving at a pace never experienced before
2257079 it would be o k to repeal or it would be o k also if a strict constructionist judge viewed it as a precedent and i think a judge has to make that decision
2257080 they filmed juno at school the spanish classroom is my classroom you can see my homework
2257081 i sent you an email i think didnt you get it
2257082 today arsenal sent us a letter saying they were willing to talk to us about adebayor
2257083 if you guys are gone when i get back from vacation
2257084 would you guys be ok with taking him home on oxygen and a monitor maybe he could come home end of next week
2257085 ive heard rumors of tuesday for homecoming since hes doing so good off the oxygen oh yeah he doesnt need to come on oxygen by the way
2257086 he doesnt need oxygen he doesnt need a monitor he passed his car seat test with flying colors hows wednesday

2257088 youre actually going to make me leave with these people
2257089 well if you guys are gone before i come back
2257090 frozen in time to keep the potency for a long time
2257091 one brigade of georgian forces is in iraq and we are calling it home tomorrow
2257092 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
2257093 and he has anointed himself ready to carry the burden of the one
2257094 to quote barack i have become a symbol of america returning to its best traditions he can do not wrong can you see the light
2257095 its a light hearted ad that pokes fun at him
2257096 for people who want a reason to be skeptical of obama this might nail it down
2257097 the end times a new testament reference to the period surrounding the return of christ were popularized in recent years by the
2257098 the rev tim lahaye co author of the series said in an interview that he recognized allusions to his work in the ad but comparisons between sen obama and the antichrist are incorrect
2257099 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama
2257100 the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania
2257101 short of 666 they used every single symbol of the antichrist in this ad
2257102 there are way too many things to just be coincidence
2257103 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2257104 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead
2257105 even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true sen mccain continues to lie about sen obamas plan
2257106 ive never done this in 25 years as a journalist but im posting transcripts of my conversations with rob richer
2257107 rob can only say from first hand knowledge that its from the white house that means either the vice presidents office the presidents office or the nsc cia chief george tenet came back from the white house one day with essentially the memo sheet with the mission to create this fabricated letter
2257108 what i did on this book having worked with george on the last book is i said i need to go to people who have first hand active knowledge from their own actions of things that they did
2257109 i said look you guys are walking into the hottest fire you can imagine
2257110 the book is really about america finding its moral compass
2257111 much of its about the conflict between power and truth its really oddly about the american character at this moment we bled away some of this precious matter the moral authority that really underlies power in the world and how do you get that back i kind of wept as i wrote part of it
2257112 what you find is public rhetoric thats often lofty while its private practices are often low and ugly they two things ultimately become clear at some point americans are feeling a crazy disconnect
2257113 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job my first year
2257114 smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2257115 i couldnt ask for him to be any more gracious than hes been and supportive since the campaign ended
2257116 if you want to support your candidates of choice the most secure way remains a hard dollar contribution
2257117 even if these prosecutors were so cold hearted and so focused on getting paul they should have been humane enough to agree to some release terms that would enable him to be with his very sick wife
2257118 minors actions and his actions alone are responsible for his imprisonment and no amount of sympathy can form a legal basis for his release from prison
2257119 each case is evaluated individually so theres not a specific timeframe that i can indicate a request will be approved
2257120 minor was never found to be a flight risk and the issue of danger was with his alcoholism for which there is now a clear record of improvement and which could be redressed through numerous conditions that could be imposed on release
2257121 there are of course conditions of release that would ensure that he complied with court order so that hes not a danger to anyone
2257122 paul has courageously examined his life confessed his personal failings and faults and is trying to choose who he wants to be from this point on in his life
2257123 the response includes information on the national cyber security center how privacy will be protected under the cnci how success of the initiative will be measured and how the department views the private sectors role in the initiative
2257124 the department chose to redact information relating to contracting at the national cyber security division the senators have asked dhs explain their reasons for the redactions
2257125 why was the determination made that the contract will be for a 10 month period
2257126 how will the dhs provide appropriate oversight to ensure that the contractors support efforts do not intrude on inherently governmental functions
2257127 prior to this announcement committee staff had been instructed that the existence of the ncsc was itself classified
2257128 their letter to dhs in may asked for a detailed account of the departments role in the comprehensive national cyber security initiative noting a lack of information from the department in spite of the fact that the administration had claimed that cybersecurity was one of chertoffs top four priorities for 08
2257129 rod beckstrom the director of the national cyber security center in dhs continued the pattern of providing few details during his keynote at the black hat security conference thursday in las vegas
2257130 instead of getting into specifics both examples of real threats and what the government is trying to do about it he mainly talked in general terms about how businesses need to understand better the economics of security and the need to improve collaboration between people and governments throughout the world he also talked at length about abraham lincoln and george washington and how those two would have approached tech security
2257131 beckstrom started in march so hes still pretty new plus this administration has gone through cyber chiefs like spinal tap goes through drummers
2257132 so we should cut him a little slack still we couldnt help but feel disappointed by what we consider another missed opportunity
2257133 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2257134 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in detroit wayne county and the state
2257135 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2257136 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2257137 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home
2257138 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2257139 i think that we are having an important debate about how we keep the country safe
2257140 those are important judgments for the american people to make
2257141 i dont need another job in government with anybody look im a republican all right senator mccain is a fine patriot and he would be a great president
2257142 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2257143 we think we have a pretty good estimate of how much abu nabaa solicited
2257144 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2257145 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2257146 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2257147 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2257148 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2257149 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2257150 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2257151 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2257152 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2257153 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2257154 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2257155 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2257156 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2257157 during the course of the conspiracy kuo cultivated a friendship with bergersen bestowing on him gifts cash payments dinners and trips to such places as las vegas
2257158 kuo also led bergersen to believe that he would make bergersen a part owner or an employee of a company selling us defense technology to taiwan after bergersens retirement from government service
2257159 i do think we need to examine the issues of both gulf war syndrome and the anthrax vaccine and how they can be dealt with they are political problems for us
2257160 it didnt bother me that rove referred to it as a political problem at the time because it meant that it would be properly dealt with finally
2257161 the political problem became a problem to me when they dropped the ball and allowed the program to continue it was politics that motivated them to investigate and it was politics that motivated them to allow the program to continue now the political nature bothers me
2257162 bruce ivins was responsible for the death sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailings
2257163 purchase install and deploy the eligible homeland security equipment and manage related law enforcement protective actions
2257164 has the unprecedented boom in biodefense research made the country less secure
2257165 adverse effects may include redness or swelling where the shot was given larger than the bottom of a soda can and or more than 24 hours of headaches muscle joint pains and or fatigue tiredness that interfered with your daily activities
2257166 bioport should not be able to keep that contract for years they never met any goals or objectives for years they got bonuses that equaled or exceeded their salaries and didnt accomplish their goals
2257167 the damage that was done to our tigers in the armed forces is incredible
2257168 hundreds of pilots have left the air force rather than take the shot 6 million to train one pilot thats a high price to pay right
2257169 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008
2257170 fannie mae is providing stability and liquidity to the housing market in the united states and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle
2257171 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgement of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan
2257172 guarantees itll be easy for unscrupulous players to cheat and thats obviously whats going on here
2257173 the safest course of action is to say we wont certify imports from china because their law wont allow inspections
2257174 everybody there is so proud of increased production that few people ask much about the farmers production methods

2257176 this is the beginning of a new physics of materials which enables researchers to determine physical parameters and properties in the nano range through highly precise measurements of the atomic spacings this will also provide clues on how these properties may be manipulated in order to gain new functions and better functional performance
2257177 didnt ask for it but you should never have gave it to me if it wasnt going to happen
2257178 i was initially shocked but you know when duty calls
2257179 i cant do much about it im being optimistic about everything taking it with a smile having a good attitude about it disappointed that i didnt get my one shot but thats ok because when i went to the academy i initially went to the academy to be an officer
2257180 its unfortunate but it doesnt mean caleb campbells dream is dead it just means it will be delayed

2257184 there were a lot of questions why is this kid going to be able to pursue this opportunity
2257185 i had a lot of guys come up to me i think initially they were confused they didnt understand the aspect of this whole situation but it was never anything vulgar just a lot of questions a lot of curiosity from my fellow cadets

2257187 army has redefined the alternative service option to include playing professional sports
2257188 our coaches are now operating under a significant handicap when recruiting head to head with army it may not be reflected on the playing field today but i can guarantee you that it will result in a competitive disadvantage down the road
2257189 the real advantage for the army is just the amount of publicity we get
2257190 when you think about it whos the best recruiter for the navy you can think of david robinson hes called the admiral for goodness sake the attention that we get in our primary demographic to have someone playing sports whos in the army thats where we in the army see the advantage in this program
2257191 an activity with potential recruiting or public affairs benefit to the navy and marine corps
2257192 the performance will reflect the cultural aspects of chinese society and showcase what modern china and its people are all about

2257217 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2257218 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the market place
2257219 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2257220 while that is significant the strength this event supposedly created yesterday was rather insignificant
2257221 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2257222 generally the banks that have done relatively well in maintaining profitability are not pure play investment banks

2257224 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2257225 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2257226 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2257227 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2257228 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2257229 the tremendous downtown changes have given the residents a renewed sense of confidence and optimism about the future of the city
2257230 externally its really helped us to reset the image of kansas city
2257231 in order for us to go downtown and bring jobs into downtown we wanted cordish to push along with their plan under a specific timeframe
2257232 we wanted an area that would attract the kind of employees h amp r is looking for
2257233 people are back downtown with their pets with their bikes and vespas
2257234 but the area also provides the best options for larger blocks of space at competitive rates

2257243 american democracy has weathered many storms in its 239 years its survival and prosperity are consequences of both good fortune as well as the remarkable foresight and common sense of its founders however a new kind of challenge looms on the horizon unanticipated by even the most prophetic of the founding fathers it is technology more specifically digital technology which both offers the promise of unfettered communication learning and global commerce and the prospect of a panopticon like state two extremes two doors each with radically different outcomes
2257244 simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein now has weapons of mass destruction there is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends against our allies and against us
2257245 let me be clear analysts differed on several important aspects of these programs and those debates were spelled out in the estimate they never said there was an imminent threat
2257246 vice president cheney and what weve seen recently that has raised our level of concern to the current state of unrest if you will if i can put it in those terms is that he now is trying through his illicit procurement network to acquire the equipment he needs to be able to enrich uranium to make the bombs question aluminum tubes vice president cheney specifically aluminum tubes
2257247 there is no doubt that he has chemical weapons stocks
2257248 it is important to underline the word estimate because not everything we analyze can be known to a standard of absolute proof
2257249 there is no reliable information on whether iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons or where iraq has or will establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities
2257250 saddam hussein no one has said that there is evidence that saddam hussein directed or controlled 9 11 but lets be very clear he had ties to al qaeda he had al qaeda operatives who had operated out of baghdad
2257251 should iraq acquire fissile material it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year
2257252 but you can buy them from outside heres the number of an agent

2257274 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
2257275 our neighbor worked for the climate modeling section of this division and was laid off
2257276 frankly its irrelevant whether it was human caused or not the focus should be on whether humans can do something about it
2257277 frankly its irrelevant whether it was human caused or not the focus should be on whether humans can do something about it did i really just read that
2257278 frankly its irrelevant whether it was human caused or not the focus should be on whether humans can do something about it

2257285 it is as close to scientific fact as you can get
2257286 critical survival of economies societies not individuals they will always survive as the record shows so far choices
2257287 just a simple chemistry 1a question here but wouldnt the melting of glacial ice in greenland antarctica and the rest of the arctic mean the ocean could absorb much more heat from the atmosphere since the specific heat of water is about double that of ice 4 187 kj kg k vs 2 108 kj kg k
2257288 yes not every single contributor is a scientist the vast majority are
2257289 it is as close to a scientific fact as you can get
2257290 its not padding perhaps these individuals perform critical work for a scientist or group of scientists and their efforts are being recognized
2257291 there is concern that they could be used in places where detainees are enclosed in extremely hot conditions
2257292 typically prisoners are isolated for no more than 12 hours
2257293 someone in a segregation box is actually observed more than those anywhere else
2257294 since the abuses at abu ghraib the us has improved conditions for the 20 000 detainees it holds
2257295 the us hopes to continue releasing prisoners recently some 20 foreign fighters were sent back to egypt and saudi arabia and thousands of iraqis have been set free
2257296 we are able to capture threats to the iraqi government and the population detain them rehabilitate them and 99 times out of 100 release them
2257297 human rights advocates warn that as long as the us military puts people in these conditions the day may come when a captured us military member is held in a wooden crate somewhere in the world

2257306 after a stunning battle former vice president al gore is elected democrat presidential candidate
2257307 i can just not imagine a better diplomatic wingman than ambassador ryan crocker we were determined to achieve unity of effort
2257308 these are not light switch moments what you have is more of a rheostat many many rheostat moments where in small areas local areas districts and eventually provinces there is an ongoing transition and has been an ongoing transition for the iraqi forces to step more into the lead and the coalition forces to step back and provide enablers
2257309 it is this exercise of pushing the stone up the hill a sisyphean endeavor at times where you do make two steps up and one step back sometimes you make one step up and two steps back but over the last year or so from the large comprehensive offensive launched in june 2007 when we had all of the surge brigades on the ground since that time there has been a fairly steady degree of improvement
2257310 do you have an idea of what victory would be in iraq or the global war on terror
2257311 the provincial elections law then it can be declared that they have met them plan objectives in the political line of operation

2257325 peru recently did not renew a license uruguay didnt renew a license why do you hold venezuela to a different standard
2257326 i would think as a self described liberal you would stand up for the right of people to quote challenge authorities and institutions and yet you are apologizing for the squelching of minority views why could that be
2257327 they rctv falsified information they got people out on the street they falsified footage that showed pro chavez supporters killing people which did not happen they refuse to cover any of the pro chavez demonstrations
2257328 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process

2257331 the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many western faces with worry and even depression the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about
2257332 today well being in the life of western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask
2257333 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
2257334 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror
2257335 a false slogan characteristic of a false era people also have the right not to know and it is a much more valuable one the right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip nonsense vain talk a person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information
2257336 through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive

2257341 we need more nuclear power it means we need clean coal technology and that means we need to offshore drill for oil and natural gas we need to drill here and we need to drill now
2257342 and anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
2257343 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
2257344 we are spending all of this time on a parliamentary tactic when nothing less is at stake than the planet the air we breathe our children breathe
2257345 anyone who does not believe the price of oil will plummet the minute congress approves more drilling is either naive or stupid
2257346 while the saudis and the uae are primarily sunni muslims and the iranians are primarily shiite tensions between these islamic branches would not be a significant factor in this dynamic

2257376 the papers did not seek comment from ndabeni ncube or provide details of his meeting with tibaijuka
2257377 retailers and commuter omnibus operators for the sharp rise in bus fares and prices of basic commodities
2257378 on urban commuter omnibuses who were not following stipulated fares
2257379 which they announced without government approval soon after the fuel price increases
2257380 a friend is one who knows us but loves us anyway
2257381 you dont need to put pilots in a vehicle where you are only collecting data providing you can do it safely
2257382 thats going to drive savings in weight which will drive savings in fuel costs so where you see normal routine data gathering operations by manned aviation today i would see that gradually being transferred over to uavs in the next 20 years
2257383 it has a back up so we can take control of the vehicle if we need to and fly it manually
2257384 it tells you the difference between green crops that are photosynthesizing and bare ground
2257385 the more dense the crop the less fertilizer you need to apply
2257386 we know you can get good maps of this sort from manned aircraft but its so difficult to get an aircraft to the field you need it in at the time you need it there and its also very expensive
2257387 we can see uavs extending a long way because we know that its useful for monitoring forestry and detecting disease in crops
2257388 we were here are here and shall remain here indian muslims are not asking for a separate state quite unlike some other separatist movements in india
2257389 has no muslim died in any of the bomb blasts that have occurred in our country post independence
2257390 leaders are performing well today have a clear vision of market direction and are actively building competencies to sustain their leadership position in the market service providers in this quadrant have a strong worldwide presence provide a broad range of services invest in innovative service tools and technologies and articulate a clear vision of current and future customer requirements and storage service solutions
2257391 ibms unique approach to storage and data services is founded on a client view of the problems they are trying to solve therefore we integrate across our company with ibm research and development the many recent ibm acquisitions like xiv diligent and cognos and with our robust partner network to provide end to end client solutions
2257392 in my opinion this honor from gartner shows that ibms evolving winning and well executed strategy is paying off and demonstrates our continued commitment to helping clients more efficiently store manage and understand and leverage data so they can align their it and business strategies to grow their respective businesses
2257393 we are pleased to have kelenna back in the fold
2257394 hes a young and talented player who has continued to improve during his two seasons with our team
2257395 his versatility athleticism and ability to shoot the 3 pointer certainly fit into our style of play
2257396 we think he will continue to improve and expand his game
2257397 i lived pretty well before the iphone i dont see why i should commit myself to pay an enormous amount of money over 3 years for the newest gadget i much rather invest that money instead and really enjoy myself down the road
2257398 success is the result of action directed toward a desired goal
2257399 the police are trying to reduce hindrances and reduce traffic jams that would be caused by the demonstration too
2257400 but at the same time the demonstrators say police have no business disturbing them the police have a responsibility in ensuring there is no trouble and all is safe for the public
2257401 they can scream at the top of their voice and
2257402 ah so you were the one who shouted for it just now
2257403 the only way to balance the market is by choking off demand which would require a spike above 200
2257404 oil has been very cheap now its becoming rather expensive
2257405 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened
2257406 no shouted at the heavens as in every war movie ever made tims recently cleaned bedroom emits a blinding white light a la
2257407 we have evidence to suggest cr creatine uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
2257408 those of us interested in pulmonary rehabilitation are happy to see confirmation of the beneficial effects of exercise training this information indicates that creatine supplementation not be viewed as a substitute for exercise training
2257409 this is something that is very true in my clinical experience
2257410 the uninsured cant get in to see the doctor they miss medications their blood pressure is out of control and really you see devastating consequences
2257411 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster
2257412 longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to because of hypertension
2257413 we found some pretty striking differences when we compared uninsured individuals with one of these seven conditions with insured individuals with one of the conditions
2257414 these are conditions that we take care of in the clinic we know that we can prevent disabling complications or catastrophe if we are able to manage these conditions
2257415 it is interesting that chronic conditions are more common among people with insurance than without but that isnt surprising either people with a chronic condition are likely to place a higher value on their coverage and work harder to get and keep it
2257416 but having insurance is not likely to prove to be a panacea for these folks
2257417 people with chronic conditions who are insured are not doing so well either we do not do a very good job of delivering chronic care in this country for anyone
2257418 we are encouraged that some of these mutations do not seem to completely remove the gene altogether but instead disrupt its on off switches
2257419 that does offer hope we may be able to figure out other ways of activating the gene
2257420 we can begin to think of autism as a disease of synapses of the way connections are developing in the brain
2257421 this is really quite intriguing it adds another region for science to go after to look for new targets for either autism treatment or prevention it is a very important step
2257422 we still dont understand the underlying genetics for more than half the kids with autism so we have a long way to go to understand that and to understand what non genetic factors might also contribute
2257423 we know genetics is very very important in autism but we dont know whether it is the whole answer or not
2257424 autism even though it has a heritable component is a complex disease that will take a lot of different approaches to decipher
2257425 it will not be one stop shopping we know there is no single major cause and no simple answer
2257426 when we talked to each other we realized gee a lot of our genes that are involved in autism are also their genes that are involved in learning in the brain
2257427 there is nothing more powerful in science than these kinds of serendipitous collisions between people working in related but somewhat distinct fields
2257428 pollinate the flowers of the tree of life and create a fruit that gives birth to a new world
2257429 mouths are sacred and meant for breathing in energy from the air and singing the songs of the stars

2257432 how do you see the global power dynamic in 2008
2257433 what are your thoughts about the passing of william f buckley
2257434 i wish i could answer sensibly i just cant you should see the room in which im working piles of books clippings manuscripts notes all sorts of lost treasures buried in them
2257435 the layman when asked about the introduction of steam power will usually reel off newcomen watt and trevithick
2257436 but when it comes to computer pioneers they are absolutely baffled
2257437 it was the first programmable computer that went into routine operation
2257438 when we wrote the proposal to build the replica machine an explicit goal which was to re run the first program as a tangible tribute to the pioneers that brought this about
2257439 this is a good change for america and we urge congress to pass this legislation
2257440 people with chronic disabilities need to manage their disease and not be discriminated against for it
2257441 people know about artificial intelligence but the perception is that robots are cold and calculating industrial automatons
2257442 but over the last decade there has been a new field where robots have become the opposite of that
2257443 were emotional machines we cant help it we forget how easy it is for us to be drawn in
2257444 i dont think it will be a substitute for human relationships but i certainly think people will form bonds with their robots
2257445 if they robots portray some kind of emotional response people will become attached to them
2257446 i have lived the dream and very few people get to live out their dreams
2257447 he was a very good jockey and a very very good friend
2257448 he came to me in 1992 and hes been a team player for a long time
2257449 we all became friends and it was easy to work
2257450 but he is a very good talker and a very good thinker in fact hes got a bloody good brain
2257451 this is micks day im not going to say anything about that at this stage
2257452 i take it one race at a time we know how hard it is to win any group 1
2257453 were going to try and stretch him out in distance
2257454 if hed got his ground hed have run in the derby
2257455 he would have pulled out more if needed when he hit the line he was still full of running
2257456 aidan said she is very straightforward and to bounce her out there is no point complicating it we were going nice and steady and i knew i was in the right place
2257457 she has plenty of options shes a classic winner and a nassau winner the roll continues

2257460 my father had to pay a fine of 1000 yuan thats not much in todays dollar but at the time it was 3 years wages and since he was a government worker it was very tough for us after my brother was born
2257461 when you have boys do you have to make them with boy love and when you have girls you have to have girl love did you have boy love or girl love with this baby
2257462 well you made boy love for lex and boy love for liam and boy love for eoin and boy love for me did you make boy love for the new baby
2257463 you see daddys genes decide whether its a boy or a girl but we dont get to choose so theres really no boy love or girl love just love love
2257464 bruce and steve want the legal right to file their taxes as if they were married
2257465 you never really own one youre just keeping it for the next generation
2257466 sometimes after your eyes adapt to the dark a spectacular sky appears such was the case earlier this month over ontario canada when part of a spectacular sky also became visible in a reflection off a lake
2257467 the arrangement of atoms and molecules in glass is indistinguishable from that of a liquid but how can a liquid be as strikingly hard as glass
2257468 letting email im twitter browser run full bore during the periods of the day you are supposed to be creating something is exactly as stupid and criminal as driving a car while on your cell while texting while watching a dvd player someone is going to get hurt and youll be to blame
2257469 the magical jelly bean keyfinder is a freeware open source utility that retrieves your product key cd key used to install windows from your registry
2257470 the price is right and the solution is fully programmable via a convenient web api so its snuck itself into all sorts of places
2257471 as the economy moved into a standard business downturn in 1929 and 1930 americans responded by dramatically cutting back expenditures in other areas so that they could continue making there auto payments
2257472 sometimes i watch them and see they are counting each bite to make their ice cream or chips last as long as possible and they separate the food into groups on their plates and save just like i did the best for last
2257473 opportunity does not knock it stands silently by waiting to be noticed but most of the time we do not take it because we think its an uneven exchange
2257474 its probably not a number that justifies that kind of financial commitment
2257475 we are absolutely thrilled to have monta under contract for the next several years
2257476 he has been one of the top young players in the nba for the last two years and enjoyed a tremendous season last year the growth that he has demonstrated at such a young age is incredible and we look forward to him playing a big part in our future success
2257477 we are pleased to have kelenna back in the fold
2257478 hes a young and talented player who has continued to improve during his two seasons with our team his versatility athleticism and ability to shoot the 3 pointer certainly fit our style of play
2257479 we are absolutely thrilled to have monta under contract for the next several years
2257480 he has been one of the top young players in the nba for the last two years and enjoyed a tremendous season last year the growth that he has demonstrated at such a young age is incredible and we look forward to him playing a big part in our future success
2257481 we are pleased to have kelenna back in the fold
2257482 hes a young and talented player who has continued to improve during his two seasons with our team his versatility athleticism and ability to shoot the 3 pointer certainly fit our style of play
2257483 remember that you like the colour you used to wear it often
2257484 yes but with silver bangles or earrings or rings or neck pieces
2257485 it does not it seems like a sky full of remorse
2257486 that must be light then if they are not realised
2257487 no they sit inside me as though i am an incubator
2257488 because they were not mine to begin with they came to me while i was asleep and stayed to watch the sun with me
2257489 look into it straight and watch yourself blink away the tears now open your eyes and see it through that film of agony
2257490 the sun is not grey your way of seeing it is
2257491 this sun peeps in during the rains when the clouds are grey and that one cloud stops me from seeing it and makes it appear grey
2257492 no you feel you belong to it or it belongs to you but you do not own it
2257493 if i cry over something then i own the grief
2257494 this transaction allows us to acquire another future asset and we wish marcus the best in his basketball future
2257495 we are happy to add a player like marcus to our roster
2257496 we felt that we needed to acquire another point guard and a player who is capable of running our offense and expanding our depth we feel that marcus can contribute to our cause next season
2257497 were fortunate to add a player with ronnys intangibles to our team
2257498 hes a young high energy player who will provide our squad with additional frontcourt depth rebounding and interior defense
2257499 men working offends them it has been changed i bet you could sell those men working signs for a pretty penny if only i knew before i could retire and live off the profits
2257500 obama would rather lose the war than lose the election
2257501 i watched the show with my sister and it was kinda weird because i do have a love hate relationship with her too
2257502 did not get picked thats fine because i am free to give it to a gallery now
2257503 i need to go home and pull apart the dashboard
2257504 the light is beginning to fade a little and so am i i should lighten the background more but i decided to quit
2257505 a frisbee would never be able to go as far as a disc
2257506 microsoft hasnt said no yet but then they havent said yes either
2257507 it was something i always wanted to do but i never really found anything i was interested in
2257508 he said would you be interested in auditioning for the show
2257509 and i said yeah i didnt really think it through it was just sort of a trigger response because i was a big terminator fan and then he said well you need to come in for audition tomorrow so i was in the audition process and i got the part before i really understood the full implications of what id gotten myself involved in
2257510 shes the ceo of a corporation that develops certain technologies
2257511 and shes very self empowered successful self assured singular so its a cool character to play
2257512 like i just responded to that because i was young and disenfranchised and i wanted to be her i wanted to be empowered i wanted to kick ass i wanted to push back against the people that i felt werent treating me right and so i identified with her more than anything who doesnt want to be a terminator right
2257513 it definitely has to do with the network and what i presented to them
2257514 it was one of those situations where we were all very enthusiastic about the world we were building but they loved the pilot when they read it and then they saw it and they said ok this feels a little different than we thought it was going to
2257515 since we are coming into the series at the middle of the story its easy to take a step back
2257516 its as easy to figure out what happens before as to what happens after in fact its something i have to do all the time when a show comes in short or something like that its all a part of executive producing and i actually kind of love it its like solving a puzzle
2257517 will be a lot more kinetic and a lot more iconic in certain ways the second one echo the original pilot im going to reshoot some of it but since its the second one i wont have to reshoot as much it still will have all the questions and all the cool stuff that i loved and that the network loved but people will have already been introduced to the world and feel more comfortable there
2257518 ive been working on that for quite a long time doing coraline and re recording and voices changing and it being different each time
2257519 i kind of had a higher voice in the beginning so its been easier just to have a higher voice the whole time
2257520 for one christmas henry selick gave me a coraline model and its so neat because its like actual sets real clothes on the model i have these striped stockings and theyre actually knitted by a woman and the stripes are proportionate and its like its so amazing it takes like 90 days to do three seconds of film and the patience i dont think i even have the patience for that but im so excited for it to come out i think itll be very interesting and it has such a cool look
2257521 all the things werent finished yet when i saw it but i wanted more
2257522 i wanted to see more it was so cool it is fantastic
2257523 and kind of sarcastic and i got to have colors in my hair it wasnt real but it was so much fun to be so different from my true self
2257524 cassie is what they call a watcher and that means that she can see the future but it comes in like flashes of seconds or minutes
2257525 and whatever decision that anybody makes can change the future so shes always kind of trying to beat her power in a way and try to get to that future first before it changes it was really so much fun to play a true character and i felt thats what cassie was it was so fun to be a part of like the costume and everything
2257526 shes very sarcastic and very dry and shes always like that
2257527 thats just who she is and shes kind of trying to deal with being a 14 year old and also having this power and trying to find the balance between that and also trying to save her mom her mom is in danger and shes by herself in hong kong and i think its all very tough for her and shes trying to keep a strong face on
2257528 i think the graphic novel and the screenplay attempt to ask that question and to answer it at the same time
2257529 so the experience of doing it was the experience of asking that question every time does he have any more humanity left
2257530 mostly he was an entity that was distracted by what for him were a higher order of problems which is how does the universe operate or how do particles fundamentally interact and he was being asked to be a dutiful man at the same time by his government so he was trying to attend to both of those while trying to carry on a relationship and i think ultimately he discovered through his own journey that he was no longer as interested in people as he was in the universe so i think my experience of doing it was the experience of asking that question each and every day
2257531 it was a burden for about the first day until i saw what these guys his fellow actors were in and then they also had to go work out and watch what they were eating blah di blah blah blah
2257532 we probably had about three weeks to sort of just hang out together and get to know each other and we definitely just got along right away
2257533 like gugino said we have a lot of similarities in our lives and in our families that sort of brought us even closer so we could relate these characters to things that have happened in our lives and sharing those with each other so that we knew when we were doing our scenes where that was coming from
2257534 when zack first said i would love to talk to you about playing this character i thought well this sounds amazing but in the graphic novel especially theres so much more of sally jupiter as an older woman than there is in her youth
2257535 we have the flashback to the rape and a couple of other brief moments but not much else so i thought thats interesting i would think hed want a much older actress and ultimately in a way sort of showing the passage of time and how we come from the 40s to the 80s he ended up adding in a lot more images of her as a young woman i think you need to see sally jupiter shine in her own right so that you can understand why she tries to impose that on laurie
2257536 i was in full prosthetics when we were doing this
2257537 it was a really natural sort of connection for us in our lives
2257538 there wasnt that much screen time to really establish that relationship either but i think any daughter would say that their relationship with their mother is complicated on some level probably like any son and their father i mean its just an intense complex thing so it was great to be able to have the chance for us to talk about all of those elements in our own lives because it does bring things to light
2257539 we are steering away from the word flashback and embracing a whole new word
2257540 once again when season five starts youre not going to know when and where you are we do this fun thing every year where we let the audience figure out where they are
2257541 there will still be flashbacks and flash forwards on the show but we are going to do something different this season and mix it up there will be storytelling both on the island and off the island and in different periods of time its just going to be organized differently and not constrained by the rules of flashbacks and flash forwards
2257542 we shot in prague for four months its got everything its got submarines helicopters planes hummers bikes jet skis you name it weve got it in there nature didnt help we needed snow and didnt get it so it was a rough shoot
2257543 its one of those movies whereby the interaction of the characters needed to evolve within the script while we were filming
2257544 thats never easy to accomplish but somehow with vin and melanie thierry and myself we had an incredible chemistry sparked off by the madness of mathieu kassovitz
2257545 religion war everything is taken over and people have lost humanity and hope
2257546 and there is this mercenary diesel who has been hiding in the lost world in europe because its war torn and ravaged he tries to get home to america and hes in conflict because theres no way he could get back until someone presented him with this option deliver this package and we will give you safe passage home
2257547 these two women have been living out in the remote mountains to get away from all the chaos thats been happening
2257548 and as the three of them journey back to america they discover that people are chasing after them so its a journey full of danger hazard and theyre trying to kidnap the girl as well is she a weapon of destruction the hope to our future this is something we have to protect we have to make sure our girl goes into the hands of the right people
2257549 a little bit of pressure i had looked at what we could do and the movie does not revolve around wire fu there is some wire work but i didnt want crouching tiger i didnt want them running up walls and flying and all of that or house of flying daggers i wanted there to be gravity that gravity was always a factor and even though we would stretch reality a little bit whatever goes up must come down as we know it
2257550 i was thinking of what kind of fight they could have and i came to swords because i believe that in a sense it leveled the playing field between a man and a woman because the weapon itself is partly an equalizer
2257551 so i said to jet and michelle this thing is going to be like a dance and im going to shoot it a certain kind of way where i have ability to change the time sequence so moments theyll be very extended or very compressed and itll go between reality and fantasy and therell be a certain amount of wire work anyway that was my approach that it was ballet in the middle of a battle that was raging around them this fantasy battle and that it would highlight both actors gracefulness as opposed to their brutality because it is a man versus a woman and when you get to ballet a pas de deux with swords which was my concept you kind of equal the playing field enough to say its a battle
2257552 after in post is when i realized that i had had her swing right close to jets head in the one moment she might have won
2257553 and it was later that i went you know what would be fun if we digitally extended his hair his ponytail and she cut it that was like an afterthought
2257554 i didnt have anything to do with the two hour telefilm
2257555 i was brought in after the movie to create the series but what i found was that fans missed certain things like the turbo boost and the interaction between mike played by justin bruening and k i t t voiced by val kilmer
2257556 i went back and watched the original series the first season and asked whats the mythology where are we going and how do we create this 25 years later its been all about taking the concept to the next level
2257557 we live in a world where two wars are going on and there is terrorism its not as simple as it was in the early 80s when you just go and get the drug dealer down the street there is a much larger threat out there
2257558 i think the biggest thing was embracing technology and owning it and making it our own
2257559 we realize it is an iconic show and that david hasselhoff is an iconic person but we couldnt redo the same thing over again i dont think the other half of the audience would stand for it and theres a whole new generation who has never seen it at the knight rider comic con panel we were in the room when the car transformed and the kids went crazy i think we are doing the right thing
2257560 i had to go through sensitivity training for my job at a small magazine publisher and during the training our trainer told a story about hazing in the firefighting community
2257561 i was fascinated by the idea and came back to my workstation to e mail danielle about it what if there was an elite task force that got out of hand and had to be given sensitivity training i asked to which danielle replied what if they flew dragons the rest of the book grew out of that initial concept
2257562 as the two try to one up each other in innovative warfare volstov creates the ultimate weapon mechanical dragons fueled with liquid magic forcing the ke han to retaliate with their own last resort
2257563 we had to conduct the entire process over instant messages and e mails
2257564 we were also writing on separate coasts in separate time zones so while that distance was an obstacle we learned to exploit each others waking hours to the fullest
2257565 a lot of the time danielle would write while i was asleep and vice versa danielle would write about five to 10 pages send them off to me i would proofread those pages add five to 10 and send it back to her the writing had a snowballing effect and wed always have a new part to look forward to in the morning or when we got back from work or school
2257566 its something that star wars creator george lucas has been thinking about for many many years and as you know hes a real storyteller and he had lots of ideas and stories that he wanted to tell during this time frame between episodes ii and iii
2257567 and he didnt have the time to do it before working on all the other movies so finally he decided that this was the time
2257568 and its amazing how he can just start riffing on some of these characters that you may have only seen for a brief moment in one of the live action films and all of the stuff that will come out from him he just knows this inside and out
2257569 its not just about the clone wars as much as its personal stories its dramatic and theres comedy its all kinds of stories mixed into one which is what star wars is all about and the characters that the writers wanted to delve into exist at that point in the star wars universe and galaxy
2257570 we dont initially start off thinking at all about how were going to make it
2257571 we just start telling a story that we find interesting i mean being huge animation geeks we tend to incorporate elements that are friendly to that medium just inherently i think and its only later that we start to think how is this actually going to be done its all about the story
2257572 in part its just because were still figuring it out i mean at this point now we know our film pretty well but theres not all the stuff that we want to be able to show people because were still working on it and also just i think it helps us kind of focus on one thing at a time
2257573 i always had this sort of vague notion that films would spring forth fully formed out of a creators brain
2257574 like walt disney would sort of wake up and go dumbo and then theyd just do it you know doesnt ever happen never not one of the films that weve worked on has been like that its always been like hey theres kind of a cool idea and you play with that and you add this and this and throw that out so its a very organic weird messy process and this one came basically from co director bob peterson and myself playing around with ideas over the course of about a year i guess until all the elements really clicked
2257575 i wrote this while working on heroes and was absolutely inspired by the work we were doing there the larger than life storytelling
2257576 i absolutely bounced ideas off the writers there and asked for their help and advice at various points i probably could not have written this without them being there encouraging me and giving me good ideas when i didnt have them
2257577 i look at kings as a high end family drama where the family just happens to be a royal family there are similarities in that there will be ongoing storylines but kings lends itself a bit more to stand alone stories in the battlestar galactica model there are no barriers for entry for audiences
2257578 taking these elements and thinking what is goliath in this world
2257579 and taking these touchstone elements that people do know from the story and bringing them to life in a new way we are taking inspirations from the original bible story so its very much a story of one king rising while another one falls its a way for me to tell godfather like stories or these operatic stories
2257580 im not afraid of sci fi and i love it
2257581 we didnt want to do this as a space opera we wanted it to be a familiar world but at the same time we are inventing a world we had a lot of fun inventing what this world is going to look like we are taking new york and impressing our own aesthetic and own iconography we got to have a lot of fun with that i remember talking to david eick about this when he was doing battlestar and he said they were always asking themselves the question what do doorknobs looks like we decided that we wanted to have things look like they could fit in our worlds but youre not sure what city it is
2257582 i look at it as the hand of faith guiding the heroes
2257583 im curious to see how people perceive that the ongoing discussions when people see it are is that magic did something just happen beyond physics is it something special or luck i wont answer that and will let people interpret that
2257584 theres 14 new commentaries on top of the original 14
2257585 so 28 commentaries in total and we did commentaries with some of our various geeky celebrity fans basically it was sort of like a geek nexus of me simon jess quentin tarantino matt stone kevin smith patton oswalt and bill hader
2257586 a lot of it was nice because they were people that had inspired us in the first place particularly in the instance of quentin and kevin smith
2257587 to do commentary on the scene with the pulp fiction reference we do in episode one season two and having quentin in the commentary booth was quite bizarre it was a moment of circularity that i think anyone rarely experiences and it was great i mean kevin smith just wanted to talk about other things didnt he
2257588 thats the thing about doing a dvd commentary because actually sometimes when you go off completely tangentially it becomes a lot more interesting because you get the kind of strange ramblings and actually sometimes when you get too literal it can be boring
2257589 i think what j j has created and what weve been a part of is really the birth of these characters not only their individual journeys and how they all meet but also the forging of those relationships and how it carries on to the five year mission
2257590 infuse these characters with as much humanity as possible so not only are you getting the big effects you would expect from a blockbuster but also something of a character movie which i think is difficult to do and i think weve done extremely well
2257591 zach is great between him and karl urban and the rest of the cast theyve really captured who these characters are
2257592 i wrote him a letter in the beginning of the process and introduced myself and said hello just to make a connection because i didnt know him at all
2257593 and he was very nice and he was very gracious and sent me a letter back and thats the only contact weve had except my father in the first week i got the star trek project did a priceline commercial with william shatner so there was multi generational contact with mr shatner
2257594 because im a ufo buff for me i like finding shows that show sort of the ufo experience with some intelligence that was a show that was sort of designed in that nature like heres a great what if who would be the people you would put together and how would they deal with an alien invasion the dvd was sitting on my desk when carla came in to meet and i really got excited by the notion that they were treating it like science
2257595 they find me and johnson brings these kids in and says theyre aliens
2257596 and immediately of course i think youre bulls tting me and then i realize that its true at which point its the most exciting thing thats ever happened to me in my entire life and after being somewhat sort of hysterical i finally become a part of the team and we head off to try to race to witch mountain we find out that both our planet and the planet theyre from are in dire dire straits and its kind of up to us to save the day
2257597 andy was actually a fan of the show and when i first read this i was like oh god i dont know if this is going to be too similar to this character i played
2257598 because for me i always want to play something new you know
2257599 there are the adventure elements and theres the great sort of mystery and those elements but theres a lot more comedy in this and ultimately as we started to flesh her out and find her more shes much goofier than molly this character is a total kook and shes just much more like a kid in a candy store whereas molly was much more type a but they could be sisters
2257600 its funny it sounds like a joke theres actually a rabbi and an episcopal priest involved
2257601 its pre religion and it dates back before judaism before christianity i started researching spirits and exorcisms it all comes from the same thing i was even researching kind of muslim mythology and all those religions came out of the same basis and so the whole idea with this is it goes back much much earlier so were talking like 5 000 years almost like pre language
2257602 i was reading about support groups of people that had grown up as only children that had discovered that they actually had unborn twins
2257603 that they were in the womb with a twin and then something happened and the twin died during pregnancy so theres a series of support groups around the country for people who have found this out after the fact i thought it was creepy and in some instances also a situation will happen where you know one of these twins will die in the womb and because if they try to get rid of the dead one it would put at risk the living one the mother has to carry the dead one to term and so the living one and the dead one are in the womb together for like four or five months and that actually happens and i just thought that is a crazy starting point for a horror film
2257604 i think once a film makes 200 million i guess its a pretty good sign that therell be more of them
2257605 and i think its something the studio dreamworks animation is pretty excited about and chief executive jeffrey katzenberg in particular is really excited about the franchise potential of kung fu panda so yeah i think im sure therell be many stories to tell and itll go on
2257606 at this point i dont know exactly what the plans are
2257607 i think theres stuff in the works but im taking a little vacation and then im actually going back to a project ive been developing for a while
2257608 ive been really excited about a lot of stop motion thats been happening lately
2257609 and it seems like theyre trying to push the boundaries and i think that theres potential to use the best parts of stop motion and to use the best parts of cg in a way to really take stop motion to the next level
2257610 i had actually just shot a pilot with fellow regular cassidy freeman and they didnt pick it up i think it was a day or two later that i got the call from smallville we talked a lot and i love playing the character i have a lot of faith in the writers that they will write great stuff for me
2257611 clark and oliver are buddies and friends in the premiere
2257612 its actually why oliver is coming to back to look for clark but oliver gets broken down a little bit he starts to look at all the things he sacrificed to do what he does and he starts to wonder if it was worth it its kind of cool and i think everybody does that but once you start to question something and your heart is not in it then it becomes really dangerous to keep doing it because you are vulnerable and susceptible its like the football players that say if youre not going to play 100 percent you are going to get hurt oliver starts to question if its worth it anymore and clark starts to embrace his destiny a little bit more its interesting because the guy thats worn the suit is going the other way and the guy who has never worn the suit is going that way
2257613 were going to go back into the smallville mythology and explore how oliver became the green arrow why he is the green arrow and how he became so good at archery
2257614 theres something i think sort of charming about the fact that three characters in north london are acting out these moments from big american films
2257615 and theres definitely something about spaced that has that aspirational quality because its almost like the characters can only articulate their lives through the media they consume and so tim and daisys lives are played out in a succession of video game and comic book and tv and music and film references because thats the only way that they can communicate
2257616 now its slightly more even handed youre getting a lot more of our stuff than you used to but we brought in so much american product because our tv industry wasnt big enough to support itself entirely and also people are interested in it
2257617 in fact when we started making references to spaced in shaun of the dead that was the most crystal moment of self indulgence ever its kind of weird i suppose although its funny in spaced theres a line when tim says about every odd numbered star trek movie being s t which is kind of a huge irony considering im now in star trek xi playing scotty so its funny how those things come back to haunt you obviously the rule doesnt apply anymore
2257618 the rainbow tribe is a great little summer camp movie
2257619 its got grayson russell from talladega nights and david james elliott its a sweet little movie its doing the festivals right now and its getting some really really good response i basically went to summer camp last summer and shot it
2257620 and there is kind of a fantasy element to it its the aurora borealis and it deals with that camp mythology what we thought was real when we were kids was it real that feeling of invincibility we had was it just youth or was there something to it some gravity to that its a sweet little movie i know theyre really looking to get it a theatrical release and theres even talk of doing a sequel before this one gets released because the kids are growing up fast
2257621 i wanted to do something different so i came up with a cunning plan to write a fantasy novel set in an early victorian style society
2257622 secondly i wanted to blend science fiction elements into a fantasy novel hence the nano technological steammen race steam driven transaction engines computers airship cities and other dimensional foes
2257623 oliver is framed for a murder he didnt commit while molly realizes she is being hunted by assassins and they both have to go on the run and work out who is trying to kill them and why
2257624 they are soon mixed up in a deadly conspiracy that involves agents of the court of the air a mysterious organization that operates out of a high altitude airship city and acts as judge jury and executioner when it comes to dealing with threats against the kingdom
2257625 british parliamentary practices airship building and flying victorian history period criminal argot i thought it would never stop
2257626 but then i never cease to be amazed by the gems you can turn up like londons early 19th century plans for a working atmospheric an airless vacuum based subway system with high velocity transport capsules that went straight into my book
2257627 electrical current has become erratic and hard to tame at the useful levels where engines can be driven reliably
2257628 hence the reliance on steam power high tension clockwork nano technological systems and in the south a rather vicious form of genetic engineering
2257629 green arrow seems to be one of the characters in the wake of this phenomenal summer book ended by iron man and the dark knight for which goyer received a story credit i know that for warner brothers green arrow is one of the characters that theyre really interested in and seem to be interested in moving forward with next
2257630 it started out as a supervillain escape idea and the idea was well we can either go marvel or dc
2257631 and i talked to both of them and i kind of said well who can you give me because i needed a superhero that i can bounce off of and i dont know for my money it was if we went marvel it would be captain america if we went dc maybe green arrow and green arrow seemed like the best fit
2257632 green arrow is you know probably on the same level as iron man
2257633 in the imagining of a post apocalyptic world you do have unfortunately a lot of references that we can go to today
2257634 war torn countries and third world countries where people dont have access to basic clean food and water and necessities and medical provisions and thats something to kind of examine i think for us to say ok yes were making a picture about totally devastating circumstances but the fact that it does reflect things that are going on currently in this privileged world that were living in where there hasnt been an apocalypse and robots havent taken over the world i mean i think thats something definitely for us to re investigate and to continue to make choices for our own future
2257635 for my character because she is a physician you really are trying to just do the best that you can given circumstances and i mean i assume shes just finding books and shes just talking to as many people who have survived at the hospital to learn techniques so she can continue to save lives
2257636 so thats been a really fascinating journey for me personally
2257637 occasionally ill just have an idea im completely like shampoo in my eyes and everything and you just have to jump out of the shower and write it down
2257638 when i got this idea i couldnt think of another film that was like this and it just was very personal to me in some ways
2257639 my father died when i was i think 4 so its just enough to have some vague memories of him but not enough to have a sense of who he was and what he thought of me so a film about a son trying to figure out who his father was and what influence he had on him is very personal my father wasnt a serial killer but you know that kind of thing is i think just very it felt like i know this kid you know
2257640 she is a nod to both ms teschmacher valerie perrine from superman the movie with tess and then her last name mercer is a nod to mercy from the comic books
2257641 but she is neither teschmacher nor mercy we are taking a little bit of both but the storyline and who she is and where she came from and where she is going is completely created by the producers
2257642 cassidy freeman is great she is a young actress and we love that you havent seen her face everywhere she is very fresh before we came down to comic con we saw a first assemblage of the premiere and we are so ecstatic with her shes remarkable
2257643 she hit the stage day one and nailed it as you can imagine not that shes becoming the new lex luthor but now that michael rosenbaum is not on the show we were wondering if we could get somebody with the layers that he brings to that character and we think cassidy really does that were excited
2257644 a little more of the emotional backdrop of what goes on inside edgar frogs mind
2257645 youve got a guy thats been over the trenches thats been in the battles and now this is his way of life
2257646 i think we pull it off it just gives a little more inside of what hes thinking what makes him tick
2257647 the thing that was so special about the first movie was the tone an open eyed look at what if a family member was actually a vampire
2257648 well its such an absurd idea that it has to be approached with humor our number one mandate that i gave to myself and to them was what would you really do this has got to be truthful humor grows out of that and that sense of absurdist realization that one of your family is a member of the undead
2257649 its really its own movie it stands alone but it also certainly pays homage to the other movie
2257650 obviously having angus sutherland playing the bad vampire is a nice nod to his brother doing the original we have corey haim and jamison newlander there as cameos
2257651 its great because the score counts up at the end of the round it kind of hearkens back to those old school quarter munching days
2257652 its marcus phoenixs story but its also about his buddy dominic santiago and his search for his wife right there from the beginning dom has the lead on his missing wife and thats an important plot point for the entire story
2257653 when we shipped the first game the reviews were great the sales were great but as creatives we always knew we could do a little better
2257654 the character lighting in the first one bugged me a little bit because we didnt have that kind of movie rim lighting that we have in the sequel we have like 400 tweaks to make it play as well as players expect
2257655 thats not only with seeing the battles with hundreds of locusts its also narrative wise other guys in other parts of the world are tuning in and letting you know whats going on you have more of a sense of the war
2257656 were not confirming any of it i never came out and said this was a trilogy somebody put words in our mouth at one point well see if gears 2 comes out and everybody hates it then there wont be a third but i hope people like it
2257657 you want television sometimes to represent the way things should be
2257658 i love the fact that theres never even a mention of it that its so seamless it doesnt really strike anyone as odd or like it needs to be addressed its completely and totally natural which is exactly what it should be life should imitate art in this sense and i have always been really proud of the network and the writers for always leaving it alone and letting it be exactly what it is and letting it live the way it does
2257659 season three is moving forward in kind of the same tone from season two
2257660 the opening episode is a massive massive special effects episode we normally shoot an episode in seven days we were supposed to shoot this one in seven days and it ended up taking at least nine its going to be a lot of fun with a couple of new characters coming into town and a couple of really really big story arc reveals
2257661 so its a great big episode and then well start moving forward into the main part of the season and there are some huge developments by about episode four episode five that i think the audience will be pretty blown away by
2257662 while i was building this world i got to speak with evolutionary biologists at cornell and rutgers a special forces major an air force colonel a mechanical engineer an m d and a young lady in politics
2257663 yes politics but its scary like everything else in the book
2257664 along with a small band of rebels ruth hopes to share the vaccine freely but the fractured u s government intends to keep this technology for themselves controlling the only gateway down from the mountains
2257665 unfortunately our enemies overseas also become aware of the vaccine colorado is hit with a massive nuclear strike which heralds the full scale air invasion of the west coast as the russians and the chinese take california
2257666 plague year tells the story of what happened to the planet and the not so lucky survivors in the mountains before plague war begins
2257667 that was a lot of ground to cover i mean year saw 5 billion people dead thousands of animal species extinct and nonstop conflict betrayals romance and adventure somehow the high points needed to be addressed in this new book without bogging down
2257668 theres also a book trailer thatll make your head explode
2257669 im lucky enough to have a friend whos a professional cinematographer and we shot a short film called
2257670 were not just making things up unless we need to for the story
2257671 there are a couple things for sure that are not based in any sort of real life but hopefully well find ways to piggyback on real things so that you find them believable in the film
2257672 we have our main character who is caricatured to such a degree that i think if you actually measure his head is like 3 feet wide and hes 5 feet tall and hes got limbs that are weird proportions
2257673 yet he looks totally believable you accept him as a real old man on the screen but hes very caricatured and so how does the cloth then behave on such a caricatured body how do things like even the scale of the balloons what size is right so its been a lot of things like that almost more artistic challenges than technical ones
2257674 it is a tricky one specifically because its such a weird fantastic place that people are not familiar with already that you could photograph it and half the audience would go i dont believe that that really exists so were straddling this line of ok we want to caricature it and make it a cartoon and yet find enough believability so that people feel like its not an alien planet or something its still earth and were still finding that its part of the fun
2257675 hes a mover which is essentially hes telekinetic nicks father was telekinetic nicks father was actually killed by the division when nick was 8 nicks father was phenomenally powerful and the division felt he was uncontrollable so they killed him actually in front of nick as a result nick has no one else no mother no siblings he kind of has turned his back on his power on people he chooses to not let anyone in because its too painful hes gone to hong kong to hide to escape and pretty much live a lonesome life
2257676 youve got to tap into a kind of fantastical world that doesnt exist you have to kind of think how would somebody move something with their mind and youve got to take your own take on it but who hasnt had practice doing that we were all little kids i can remember trying to move my pencil in math class so youve just got to tap into your inner child and be willing to be a little silly and believe it if you dont believe it no one else will
2257677 the best thing is in the movie you get to see him kind of mature in his ability
2257678 he kind of stops using his power i think it kind of brings up brutal memories i think the only time he uses his power is he gambles a lot a dice game where he kind of manipulates the dice other than that i think he kind of is pretty clumsy with it so throughout the film you see his kind of growth in that field and that was great because you get to work out how you would move a table do you do it with your eyes your hands it doesnt always work out doesnt go as far as you want it to so it kind of lent itself to my own experience
2257679 it sort of starts kind of like about two months after the events of the h g wells book finish
2257680 and the h g wells book kind of ends with you know the original invisible man griffin who has these three notebooks that all of his secrets are in and at the end of the h g wells story you establish that theyre still in existence but nobody knows where they are and my story begins with those three notebooks falling into the hands of someone else and it takes off from there
2257681 its got elements of horror but its sort of a big epic adventure movie part of it takes place in england part of it takes place in persia part of it takes place in siberia and i added a couple i think wrinkles to the notion of invisibility that nobodys managed to do before so it kind of takes it to an extreme level
2257682 i mean ive been reading a lot of kipling a lot of steampunk trying not to go in the sort of movie league of extraordinary gentlemen place laughs but there are a lot of real historical figures that are woven in among it and i think ive come up with some pretty cool things in it that i know havent been on film before so well see
2257683 youre really lucky when you have a a script to work with and then b a whole other movie to base your character off of and research you know
2257684 and the great thing about michael biehns performance is its very layered and you get a very complex character in
2257685 every little thing to me in that film said to me ok thats a part of this guy
2257686 theres the kyle reese thats obsessed with the sarah connor picture why is he so obsessed you know he doesnt talk about her like a sexual object he talks about her like this woman that hes so in love with i looked at that and said god this guy grew up and never had any relationships with girls what does that say about him you know look at how angry he is here what does that say theres just so much theres just such a vast wealth of info to go through
2257687 able to convince the network to let us air long episodes to take single episodes and make them double episodes and to take double episodes and make them quadruple episodes
2257688 our episodes are always long and were constantly getting into the editing room with 10 15 sometimes 20 minutes of material that you cant get into an episode
2257689 the story has become so critical in order to realize the arc of the series that we cant just cut stuff out and save it for later or push it til next year the stuff were used to doing its all got to be there
2257690 there are so many great episodes in between but the script of the finale its poetry it really is
2257691 like all good endings sort of ties into the beginning its like a great piece of music where all the strains and all the melodies that youve had so far come and are referred to in the end and there is a new beginning as well the same for lee its an ending and a beginning and its sublime
2257692 we were trying to do something different with science fiction with the space opera we were trying to kind of blow the wheels off the sort of star trek aesthetic and i think on that front we feel very accomplished its definitely gratifying to feel like we captured some part of the publics imagination and that the show overcame its title and overcame in some respects its genre to get the respect its gotten
2257693 its fun to see it all put together because obviously there are some special effects
2257694 it was really fun to go through the process of having this prosthetic jaw made
2257695 it took hours to put on and to look just right so that you could buy it and then have digital special effects overlaid onto my face of the jaw ripping off
2257696 growing up there wasnt a genre of film besides horror that could give you a stronger visceral reaction watching it
2257697 as an actor thats something that will draw you to a genre if you can actually affect an audience that powerfully
2257698 this idea of being able to meld these two genres a drama of a man really trying to put his world back together combined with this horrific circumstance i found an unbelievably exciting opportunity
2257699 each character has his own thing that alex has devised for them to go through physically
2257700 looking back i understand that the supernatural element is very important for the motion picture association of america which hands out the ratings i think its completely wrong and i think theyre way off but according to them its less graphic
2257701 im pretty sure were done i mean i cant say for sure you never know but i would imagine given the fact after the first film i think the week after the first film opened they were writing the next script and talking to us about it and very much involving us and we were up and running six months later the second one came out and i havent heard a word and its been almost a year now i would imagine fantastic four is done
2257702 i think what theyre going to do theyre probably going to take the silver surfer franchise and run with that
2257703 theres so much history to that character and its such a cool character and its cgi so you dont have to pay an actor so it makes sense dollars wise
2257704 well when we went into making this movie there was really no concept of making one that comes after it
2257705 without giving too much away the ending to me at least feels very finite and if the audience loves the film well wrack our brains and try to figure out a way to bring him back if were lucky enough to be in that position but this movie stands on its own
2257706 we still are terrified whenever you take on something that big you open yourself to all kinds of scrutiny which we get every day
2257707 rejoice in the lord always i will say it again rejoice
2257708 finding a way to be happy even when things dont go your way
2257709 what would you talk about with jesus if you walked down the road with him
2257710 there are two means of refuge from the miseries of life music and cats
2257711 tom comma my neighbors boy comma is a good kid period
2257712 paco boy has been working with major cadeaux for the last two or three weeks
2257713 we are probably running for a place but he is a good horse and we will give him a race
2257714 while i am not endorsing senator john mccain the possibility is there that i might
2257715 if i give you executive platinum status id have to give it to everyone
2257716 only to platinum members who have gotten canceled three times in a row and use your airline exclusively
2257717 well there are many people in that situation so i cant grant you that request
2257718 wow im very disappointed what are you willing to offer me to convince me to try american again
2257719 weve already given you 8 000 miles thats all that we can compensate you
2257720 you can take back those 8 000 miles if you want to offer me something else frankly they dont even come close to making me want to try american again
2257721 you can donate those miles to charity if you dont want them
2257722 w e dont invest any of the rituals we use with religious significance
2257723 the mankind project i believe represents a sincere effort to try and create for the first time in the history of our species a vessel of masculine initiation that strives truly to be inclusive this is a new thing on this planet a grandiose undertaking but a worthy undertaking that we have decided to work on
2257724 these are the words i want to leave with you keep love alive keep love alive and if we keep love alive my personal judgment is nothing is going to stop us
2257725 i think that there are a lot of challenges to work through especially with no venture capital
2257726 hes thinking of a world gone by when you could have done this but not this day and age
2257727 its going to be a functional commuter service with tourist appeal
2257728 i may have the feeble body of a woman but i have the heart of a king
2257729 im not going to say god did this to you but youve just been dealt a really bad hand at a really young age
2257730 i may have the feeble body of a woman but i have the heart of a king
2257731 the uk government wants to hear your ideas for new products that could improve the way public information is communicated the power of information taskforce is running a competition on the governments behalf and we have a 20 000 prize fund to develop the best ideas to the next level
2257732 her hair has been shedding like crazy lately and tonight we decided it was time to shave it she had big bald patches all over and was starting to look pretty ragged
2257733 to you this is just a job to me its my entire career down the toilet unless you make me look 80
2257734 the only comfort at this moment is that although estelle has moved on sophia will always be with us
2257735 i knew i could be seduced by success in another field so id say dont promote me please
2257736 i always told her she should be a standup comic she was so funny in person
2257737 she would always say why couldnt we make these characters jewish
2257738 a number of anti doping organizations including the international olympic committee store doping control samples of their events for eight years for potential future retesting
2257739 mice are very good at running as far as they can
2257740 when they get exhausted they just stop running they cant run any more
2257741 cant exercise and this would give them some of the benefits
2257742 people who exercise have lower levels of depression and higher bone density
2257743 whether or not this pill would confer those benefits we dont know
2257744 all i have right now is a vision of slim vain lazy mice
2257745 recently i had the pleasure of working with my friend and colleague q manning to create the following spec commercial for a contest currently being hosted by the klondike bar company
2257746 like the reflections of the lake my eyes show the love in my heart for you dear
2257747 like the reflections of the lake my eyes show the love in my heart for you dear
2257748 he is a solid defender who will fit in very well with our team we are excited to add mickael and feel he can help us reach our ultimate goal
2257749 hes been one of the most productive players in our league for the last several years and provides us with additional versatility and veteran leadership
2257750 we are really excited to add a player of coreys ability to our team
2257751 hes been one of the most productive players in our league for the last several years and provides us with additional versatility and veteran leadership
2257752 were happy with the way hes handling the pressure and the expectations

2258007 with her children getting older caroline was thinking of engaging in more active public service
2258008 lurking beneath her public shyness is a person with a great wit who works hard
2258009 the timing was perfect for her to get more involved
2258010 turning 50 made her ask herself how can i do more
2258011 because hillary has a personal relationship with caroline no one was given the responsibility to check in with caroline
2258012 friendship and support have been immeasurable for barack and me
2258013 we couldnt criticize obama for taking on the kennedy aura
2258014 because with her and teddys endorsement it was completely legitimate for him to claim the family connection
2258015 that jim johnson wasnt replaced is a strong sign of the confidence in caroline
2258016 i looked at caroline eye to eye and asked if my comments would stay confidential except to sen obama
2258017 theres been some inquiries yeah they ask for a lot of stuff ill leave it there
2258018 it was just after laos began opening up to tourism and business in the 1990s
2258019 a lot of visitors were going home and asking bars and supermarkets for beerlao and then local beer distributors began contacting us thats when we knew we might have an international brand
2258020 we dont want to undermine beerlaos word of mouth appeal so for us it is better to let it grow naturally
2258021 but its one of the few brands where the customer seeks it out rather than the other way round
2258022 i smell it and see how the head settles in the glass to judge whether its a good beer
2258023 who would miss someone wearing a white dress and an 8 foot train
2258024 she didnt get hurt or tear her dress and i didnt get kicked out of the wedding for almost killing the bride
2258025 by the time their hands hit their face immediately hits and they smash to the ground
2258026 u gotta walk with ur chin about 45 degree angle n u wont bump into nothing
2258027 on my bum as they say and feet in the air
2258028 because meteorites represent left over materials from the formation of the solar system the key components for life including nucleobases could be widespread in the cosmos
2258029 now we have this beautiful garden so theres never any reason to go anywhere else
2258030 you have all sorts of roles and personas they are valid and important embody them fully however they are time bound and dont fully capture your essence your true essence could never be captured by an occupation a gender a religion or a personality type your true essence is beyond words and description you are nothing less than a christ a child of god an expression of universal love in this moment
2258031 we must clean the country of the crawling mass of maggots
2258032 the house i spent all my fortune on is gone my family is homeless it all happened so quickly one minute we heard rumours about our houses being demolished the next we were hurriedly packing our familys belongings since the riot police were moving in fast we watched helplessly in the winter cold as bulldozers razed our houses the house i had spent four years building was destroyed in the blink of an eye i had borrowed money and used most of my salary on this house but it is no more
2258033 we must clean the country of this crawling mass of maggots
2258034 our lives have been destroyed i was living in the joburg lines in mbare with my younger brothers and sister while i made a living selling vegetables at the bus terminus now that they have destroyed our houses and prohibited us from selling our wares from mbare musika we do not know what to do next
2258035 i have nowhere to go with my children i have spent four days sleeping in the cold even if i get a place to live i do not have the money to pay rent and transport to go to work my husband is unemployed and i have three children who are all in school
2258036 i do not know how they are going to cope with the situation
2258037 accommodation is a problem in the city as several more affordable cottages i could have gone to rent with my family have been destroyed even aeneas chigwedere the education minister has admitted that schoolchildren who lived in these illegal homes have been forced to drop out of school however his ministry is assessing the extent of the problem before they can act on the matter but how long will it take for them to assess the matter while children miss out on classes
2258038 i have been made homeless in my country of origin where can i go for refuge we hope they are going to do something as this is a disaster
2258039 god grant me the serenity to accept the people i cannot change the courage to change the only person i can and the wisdom to know that person is me
2258040 might have been spooking about for years perhaps centuries but i dont think so i honestly do believe that i wrote it myself
2258041 god give us grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed courage to change the things that should be changed and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the other
2258042 god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference
2258043 although wealth was unlikely to make anyone miserable wealth alone would not make people truly happy
2258044 if we had money without friends freedom and an analyzed life we will never be truly happy and if we have them but are missing a fortune we will never be unhappy
2258045 it was a great exposure india is now a global village and artists are connecting to buyers outside unlike yesteryears artists do not have to depend on odd jobs money has brought an explosion of creativity
2258046 but there is enough room for my kind of work in terms of art india is now very positive artists are rich now
2258047 in the 1970s there was hardly any money but the number of collectors has grown now it is easy for prices have doubled
2258048 i remember buying one of artist sunil das horses the motifs for which the artist is famous for rs 5 000 in 1992
2258049 people are willing to spend on art both as an investment and for the love of the medium then there are people like me who just love art
2258050 it was only when i lay there on rotting prison straw that i sensed within myself the first stirrings of good gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart and through all human hearts
2258051 kext has immediate dependencies on both com apple kernel and com apple kpi components use only one style
2258052 morgan tsvangirai raymond majongwe mike davies and grace kwinje etc are the candles burning big and bright the icing is made up of a small section of civic and political activists while the actual cake itself comprises the zimbabwean people
2258053 until we the zimbabwean people come to the party and support civic and political leaders working for change not much will happen the cake has got to cook its got to get warm and bake and maybe even burn but it cant stay like it has been unmovable
2258054 because if it does no matter how many highfield rallies we have and no matter how iconic tsvangirai becomes the struggle for freedom in zimbabwe will remain lop sided
2258055 no doubt the fall out over this violence will last only a few days before the world neatly sweeps it under the carpet and the dirty underbelly of african politics
2258056 please would someone out there actually do something about this mugabe person
2258057 south africas so called quiet diplomacy has achieved precisely nothing in zimbabwe
2258058 its call to mugabe yesterday to respect the rights of citizens will change nothing mugabe like his ilk elsewhere in the world recognises cowardice when he sees it and knows that talk is cheap
2258059 the world as seen through the eyes of a zimbabwean
2258060 the media in zimbabwe is owned and operated by the mugabe regime so in sundays aftermath zimbabweans are being force fed a diet of mdc thuggery non attendance and opposition violence this makes me wonder when the pro democracy movement will get its act together in terms of creating its own robust media and information response unit
2258061 the herald is a zimbabwean government owned newspaper and the bbc is a british government owned broadcaster the heralds version is pro mugabe and pro police but at least it was there the bbc wasnt its version is mdc propaganda with a little bit of british imperialism chucked in
2258062 morgan tsvangirai is a western sponsored terrorist he plotted in london to assassinate mugabe and overthrow the elected government there is nothing democratic about the mdc the only reason the british government is anti mugabe is they still consider zimbabwe to be rhodesia
2258063 europe intervened in the balkans and the coalition of the willing did a job in iraq but nobody seems to care about zimbabwe
2258064 britain in my view has more legal grounds to invade zimbabwe than it did iraq
2258065 mugabe has clearly violated the agreement he has breached conditions including white representation in parliament nb this clause has expired independence of the judiciary citizenship and payment of pensions these should be sufficient grounds for britain to demand change or otherwise invade who knows maybe john howard will even commit a couple of hundred australian troops
2258066 the big problem for me is that china doesnt seem to care it will continue to block un efforts to protect zimbabweans from mugabe proving once again the powerlessness of the world body
2258067 you shouldnt come into a crowded waiting room and say things like that
2258068 why not you asked me what was wrong and i told you
2258069 now youve caused some embarrassment in this room full of people you should have said there is something wrong with your ear or something and discussed the problem further with the doctor in private
2258070 you shouldnt ask people questions in a room full of strangers if the answers could embarrass anyone
2258071 um you know i think it was the second one the one with the thingie
2258072 but absolutely we wanted to make this a fun record to make music that could be socially engaging and challenging for this crazy time but would leave people inspired and uplifted
2258073 and the gates of hell will not prevail against it
2258074 im really excited to remain with the warriors and continue my nba career in the bay area
2258075 the organization and fans have been terrific to me over the last four years and im looking forward to building on some of the success that weve had in the last couple of years
2258076 were extremely happy to have andris under contract for many years to come
2258077 he is clearly one of the top young centers in the nba and much like the young player we signed a few days ago monta ellis he has continued to improve every season
2258078 were extremely happy to have andris under contract for many years to come
2258079 he is clearly one of the top young centers in the nba and much like ellis he has continued to improve every season its not easy to find quality young big men in this league but we certainly think we have one of them and hes only 22 years old
2258080 the organization and fans have been terrific to me over the last four years and im looking forward to building on some of the success that weve had in the last couple of years
2258081 this shows the warriors following through on their commitment to monta and andris
2258082 lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner amen
2258083 people about the spreading of christ rather than the spread of christianity
2258084 they spent the last few years trying to integrate it
2258085 there are a lot of questions that a buyer and the government would have to have
2258086 improving operations making additional investments entering into strategic partnerships and considering potential divestitures
2258087 every piece of the business is for sale at a certain price right now because they continue to struggle
2258088 even if they want to sell iden i dont think theres a buyer
2258089 solo falsit luno allaltro si dicono bocche piene di menzogna tutti a nascondere ci che tramano in cuore come rettili strisciano e i pi vili emergono al colmo la feccia
2258090 to me it speaks of the importance of our relations with china
2258091 the olympic torch will light the home of an ancient civilization with a grand history
2258092 thousands of years ago the chinese people developed a common language and unified a great nation china became the center for art and literature and commerce and philosophy china advanced the frontiers of knowledge in medicine astronomy navigation engineering and many other fields
2258093 you mean they got someone in your office who can speak the language
2258094 well continue to be candid that all people should be free to say what they think as worship as they choose
2258095 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2258096 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2258097 enough progress has been made so that a draft agreement was circulated in our respective capitals but negotiating is continuing
2258098 we are getting closer to a final deal but we are not yet there
2258099 these are not arbitrary deadlines for u s forces to leave iraq
2258100 these would be aspirational goals for iraqi security forces to assume responsibility for the safety and security of their people
2258101 there is a bitter fight going on and significant damage is inflicted on the enemy
2258102 its beneficial for all of the teams from division i through division iii its been great all the feedback ive been getting from the coaches at all the schools is that theyre very appreciative of the league
2258103 the guys from duquesne and robert morris are good and the guys from the smaller schools can shoot everyone is good everything i do here is getting me ready to play in big east games
2258104 now you can come and watch sam clancy give tips to division iii kids thats good stuff were starting to rebuild that basketball togetherness jamie deserves the credit for this he sincerely cares about basketball in western pennsylvania i dont think you could have said that about other coaches who have been at pitt in the past
2258105 he got into a fight which is a no no down here he was suspended hes back in pittsburgh
2258106 i talked to coach dixon and coach antigua thats incorrect
2258107 the easiest things were recruiting and connecting with the community
2258108 although i might not have been able to say that had i come from oregon or texas but i had a hard time adjusting to the restrictions
2258109 but this year i feel a lot better about what i need to spend time on
2258110 youve got to be wild to even think about doing it
2258111 youre throwing yourself in front of bullets thats the type of job i want to do something exciting
2258112 it makes our agents feel young again to be able to explain the job to him and see his eyes light up
2258113 hes going above and beyond he does fit the profile of a candidate weve been looking for
2258114 most of the time you think about football then reality starts hitting you
2258115 you get hurt a few times and start thinking about your future
2258116 you read about the players who get in trouble this is stuff you dont read about
2258117 hes a sharp kid hes a real success story hes not your typical student athlete
2258118 i see a lot of me and my experiences in what hes going through
2258119 i did the same thing tore a ligament in my knee and went through the rehab and played another two years i feel his pain so to speak
2258120 i was struggling in school in ninth and tenth grade and by eleventh grade it was too late to get caught up
2258121 as long as aundre does what hes supposed to do hes going to be ready to enroll at pitt in the spring
2258122 im coming here to get my grades up and retake the sat so i can play college ball
2258123 chris will end up at a very high profile school
2258124 if he plays to his full potential he could very well go to one of the top 20 schools
2258125 it looks like they want to end live broadcast tv
2258126 we already know that they arent afraid to go after news
2258127 i struggled with it mentally i didnt know what to think
2258128 finally it hit me and i began to believe in myself and understand that it wasnt about me it was about the team
2258129 i watched how the players got to the basket in the nba playoffs and i talked a lot to carl krauser pitts leading scorer as a senior last season
2258130 the key is getting to the free throw line even if you dont make the shot you want to have the opportunity to get those points somehow
2258131 im excited i expect my senior year to be a good one
2258132 i know im one of the leaders of this team now and i can tell you that since my freshman year ive been through it all
2258133 we only lost one person krauser who gave a major contribution
2258134 i think we gained a lot of experience in big games and we proved in big east games that we could get it done even when carl was in foul trouble
2258135 its going to make us a lot better knowing we can play the way we did last year in certain situations
2258136 were all going to be working hard because were playing for a position were all going to be pushing one another
2258137 its very important that we improve our game in each match
2258138 the canadians are certainly the weakest opponent and that gives us the chance to integrate dirk nowitzki into the team without any pressure
2258139 im not optimistic at all that brandon barrett will be in a mountaineers uniform
2258140 brandon he started out summer school well hes really fallen off you cant go run a guy in summer for missing class because rules prohibit coaching intervention hes a walk on so you cant threaten to take a scholarship away its been unfortunate
2258141 that duke really looks like he means business i think the image is something fans of duquesne will rally around
2258142 it wouldnt be a conflict in scheduling if everybody was division i
2258143 it would be a huge gap between the schools that are i aa and i a i would go for having one moniker
2258144 when i was here we had a first round draft choice every year weve got to get back to that
2258145 recruiting is just selling and if youre selling something you believe in its easy
2258146 its shocking that we were as thin as we were there
2258147 weve got to find ways for the defensive line to make more plays
2258148 it all starts up front its not a matter of how many tackles the middle linebacker makes youve got to have your down guys make plays
2258149 encouraged prompted by the host coach wannstedt stressed that he knows what it takes for nfl people to consider drafting someone
2258150 it was crazy i had a good camp and everything swung for me
2258151 it is always a great feeling to come out and support younger kids
2258152 the ymca football clinic allowed us to show children the right way in life rather than finding trouble on the streets
2258153 thats what we need from him just manage the game and let the other guys around him make plays he will do that he has prepared himself for this season and worked as hard as any quarterback ive been around i wouldnt want anyone else leading our team this year
2258154 and i think about coach wannstedt and oc cavanaughs history with qbs and what they want from them in the offense
2258155 looking at it now thats probably the best thing to do for everybody to get a chance to show what they can do
2258156 everybody is going to be fighting to get on the field were all trying to get the same two spots
2258157 weve got a lot of freshmen who were highly recruited out of high school theyll get the opportunity to learn the offense or defense and be ready to play we can see their talent and potential and theyre trying to get them on the field its going to be real intense this is going to be the toughest camp weve had its going to be a challenge
2258158 honestly looking back i probably should have done it last year
2258159 everybody looks at this as it just benefits the freshmen but really its not like that
2258160 we are excited about all of our bowl partners and really we are already starting to look ahead to the next round of bowl contracts to see who might be interested in the big east
2258161 the toronto bowl is really important because we as a conference are trying to brand ourselves in canada and i know for pitt we have a lot of licensed products in canada and this will only reinforce our brand as a football program
2258162 but i think one of the main reasons weve had some changes in our bowl lineup is that we felt like we had to play some bcs conferences more than just the acc for a lot of reasons as we go along wed like to get more bowl games against the big 12 the sec and the big ten because those are the games that are the most attractive and they are all a part of our strategy as we go forward
2258163 he was in the nfl bouncing around and doing those things
2258164 at first ours wasnt like a normal father son relationship because he was doing football stuff
2258165 he realized he missed out on a lot now were making up for things its never too late to make a relationship better or get it back
2258166 we grew up in the same household and al took me under his wing because he knew my dad couldnt be around as much as he wanted to be
2258167 he was my best friend he taught me everything i knew about football even if he did something wrong hed say make sure you dont ever do that he taught me to be a gentleman and to be well spoken and to carry yourself in the best situation because you never know who is watching everything he taught me i took to heart and still use it today
2258168 to me it is important to make sure there is a welcome feeling and a sense of family that runs through not just our current guys but past players
2258169 that is why guys like these have an invitation extended to them to work here sometimes i think it is overlooked how vital it is to bridge the gap between past players and the current program and this is a way to do that it is also a way to make sure the campers get solid instruction
2258170 i know i have a lot of friends here in pittsburgh
2258171 and everybody is always calling me saying come back come back when i saw that they could use some guys to work camp i had to come back here wherever it is i am in the world i know i can always come back here to pitt and that is important to me
2258172 its a huge shot in the arm for the program winning begets winning
2258173 it helped in recruiting the more we can win the more we can leverage that and continue to build a program
2258174 all along thats been the plan to have any success we had to build an infrastructure of a program that was missing it took some time but i really enjoy our football team
2258175 we set out to build a championship program and thats not about one season last season was great for the program and for the university and what it created was a window of opportunity we have a foundation now we have to keep building on it
2258176 well have to play better in every game this year than we did last year
2258177 i was on the other side and i know there were programs out there that no matter what the score believed they would beat rutgers those days are over people know they have to play a complete game which means we have to be better
2258178 i know ive been champing at the bit since the end of last season to go out and play
2258179 none of us were satisfied with what happened last year the best way to get past that feeling is to get back on the field and compete
2258180 the football deal alone will surprise a lot of people because we werent supposed to be able to sell big east football according to the doom and gloomers
2258181 the football deal is very good it will guarantee a lot of exposure for our programs the basketball deal however is off the charts any questions about our conference if there are still any out there will be put to rest
2258182 i can tell you this there were seven other big east coaches rooting for west virginia that night
2258183 im glad people are talking about that instead of saying oh that loss really hurt
2258184 i like to think that the league was ok regardless but its a positive thing to have people talk about that win
2258185 this is the first summer in a long time that we didnt feel like we were under siege
2258186 my sense is that people are more open minded now i feel a lot of people had made up their minds about this league that this was the end
2258187 you can almost sense this incredible change since the west virginia game was over
2258188 all we ever asked for was time and an opportunity to prove ourselves theres only one way to deal with criticism and thats to prove it on the field
2258189 but the fact is we have to do it again this year thats how it is every year you go out and prove it on the field and continue to get better
2258190 i know our team better i know what our guys can and cant do i am a lot more comfortable a lot more confident
2258191 comfort comes from success you pick up more as you have success
2258192 with a 12 game schedule in the same amount of weeks therell be less time for guys to recover from injuries
2258193 you have to be real smart about what you do on your bye weeks what you do when you have days off and when you have weekday games its a real challenge to take care of your players and make sure theyre as sharp as they can be
2258194 were going to have to play freshmen just because of our lack of depth
2258195 when you bring in 25 guys and you have 85 on scholarship thats a little less than a third of your team thats freshmen so theyre gonna be in a position to play how much and who i dont know
2258196 the first four days of preseason camp before we put the pads on are going to be real critical
2258197 it isnt fair to ask freshmen to compete with upperclassmen when they dont even know the plays
2258198 and it isnt fair to ask upperclassmen who have been busting it for our program for two or three years to take a backseat while we evaluate younger kids trying to take their jobs
2258199 by ncaa rules you can only have one practice per day during the first five days but as long as it is within the time restraints and as long as the players are only out there once you can split the practice up
2258200 and i just think that given where we are as a football program it is important for us to have the two different groups work separately for the first week because it will give every player on our team an opportunity to get a lot of work in
2258201 it will give the varsity player who is battling for a spot a chance to prove to the coaches he is the guy and it will give the freshman kids and younger players a chance to prove what they can do as well as get a lot of reps in and learn the system
2258202 i still think for us to reach our maximum potential pittsburgh and syracuse need to get back to where they were
2258203 when they do then i think well start to really be what i think we can be
2258204 right now he just needs to worry about having a good training camp
2258205 he has a lot of great natural ability but that only takes you so far
2258206 the thing that separates darrelle is that the intangible things are so positive by that i mean his work ethic his film study his passion to be the best those are the things that take a guy with great athletic ability which he has and puts him on top
2258207 hes a gamer every team probably has one guy maybe two that you say you never want them to be off the field youd like them to return punts youd like them to return kickoffs youd like them to be a wideout and throw them the ball hes that top of guy
2258208 you see a lot of kids theres a difference between talent and working hard
2258209 that extra work ethic is going to take you to another level
2258210 im athletic i can do things i can probably jump from here to here on one foot i can do all of that but its a thing that you have to set yourself aside and the thing about doing that is working hard the work ethic pushing through a line finish all the way through just doing the little things do the little things and big things will happen
2258211 i think were a lot different than a year ago
2258212 last year we hadnt played a game yet it was all new now weve played each other and started to develop some rivalries and see what everyone is about
2258213 weve only been playing some of these teams for three years and i dont know if you develop a rivalry in three years
2258214 you want those things to happen and i think they will you can see some signs of things maybe getting a little bit closer to that i think theres a potential rivalry to be had with syracuse and with rutgers because of a proximity standpoint and some of the things that have already happened through the basketball end of it
2258215 to me when you have rivalries i think its usually an in state thing or bordering states or its just a history of playing for a long time
2258216 i think in the short history with rutgers weve beaten them a few times they beat us last year the scores have been very close the last few years its something you see that might be happening
2258217 we have three 19 year olds a veteran for us is 23 years old its a unique situation we have the ability this summer to play these games and get to know each other with no pressure
2258218 we need to get ready for next year and the year after
2258219 i think we had a group of guys who played together for quite a few years and thats what theyre trying to establish here
2258220 weve got some guys who are going to be together and can look long term at qualifying for the olympics and the worlds and can build toward that each summer we did that with the younger team and it paid off
2258221 we had eight or nine coaches from across the country involved in the process of putting the team together
2258222 there was no question that andy earned a spot here he shot the ball very well
2258223 this is a summer of development and experience for us
2258224 we want to establish a core for the olympic qualifier next year were taking young players we feel have potential to play for us next year and in the olympics the year after and mixing them with a group of experienced veterans
2258225 its not a rivalry yet but its going to get there
2258226 when you start playing and its a game like we had and its triple overtime then it accelerates the process for us the pitt game the backyard brawl is the no 1 rivalry and people are talking about our game with marshall being a rivalry but the louisville game will probably become a rivalry much quicker
2258227 but i want to go the way most go first being a recruiting coordinator an offensive coordinator and then becoming a head coach
2258228 right now im learning from the best wannstedt about how nfl guys do it he does an outstanding job getting the most out of his players
2258229 david will be a tremendous role model for our student athletes
2258230 he has an outstanding administrative and basketball background and is an individual who will benefit our program in many facets he is a former ncaa division i player who is familiar with the kind of student athletes that we have and will continue to have representing the university of pittsburgh
2258231 it is my understanding that kojo didnt submit any dates for an appeal and hasnt submitted a list of schools to get a release
2258232 why cant he play at duquesne why cant he play with shawn there is nothing illegal about wanting to play with a friend
2258233 i want to go over this on a school by school basis the ones i have a problem with i wont release him to i wont release him to any conference school and a few others
2258234 mensah said he wanted to go to a higher program be on tv more and improve his nba chances i have no problem with a young man thinking that way but we have all of those laid out here at siena he can appeal or give us a list of schools he wants releases for based on what he said to me i would expect a list of schools from the acc and big east the last three or four times we played duquesne we beat them
2258235 based on what ive seen so far this is going to become a tremendous asset to pittsburgh
2258236 coach dixon said how can you have all those high school leagues and nothing for college kids
2258237 one thing led to another and thats how it happened
2258238 most cities do have one and i felt we needed one it will be getting bigger and it will improve basketball in pittsburgh
2258239 i told him if he did well it would change his life
2258240 when i got back i was getting blown up from all these coaches its crazy how one good camp can change your future
2258241 i figured wed get connecticut at home this was all talked about at the league meetings everything went as planned
2258242 with the strength and depth weve shown as a 16 team league we were still able to produce a large number of marquee matchups without simply forcing the perceived top three or four teams to play one another twice
2258243 when youve had the type of success that our program has enjoyed you have to expect that youre going to be challenged
2258244 the benefits far outweigh the negatives youre on tv often and there are monetary reasons for it too
2258245 once it all comes out itll again be the toughest schedule weve had to face since ive been here
2258246 it was a little surprising because our graduation rates are so much higher
2258247 it was at that point that i figured the corruption runs the full gantlet of the administration
2258248 we were getting sociology majors graduating without taking sociology classes im a director of a program putting out people who i know more than likely dont deserve a degree
2258249 i want to assure everyone associated with auburn that upon completion of the investigation we will deal with this issue as we have dealt with other challenges directly and openly
2258250 hes the kind of teacher that you know he wants to help you out not just pile a lot of stuff on you
2258251 youre just studying different kinds of math its one of those things where you write a report about the different theories and things like that
2258252 i got dropped from a class and need a class to stay eligible for the bowl game
2258253 i need a class and ill take any class right now i dont not want to play in my last bowl game
2258254 im committed to kansas state but pittsburgh could be an option
2258255 ive talked to michael about prep schools and about the possibility of him coming to the winchendon school and michael has an interest
2258256 we have very few beds left on campus im begging my headmaster to save one more bed
2258257 ill just take this as a good experience im going to go out there and compete and learn a new language
2258258 im not sure when the league starts but im going to find out a lot when i get to germany
2258259 theres a few summer leagues going on in new york ill get up there when i can
2258260 im going to play and work out as much as i can
2258261 the nba messed up in not picking up a veteran point guard like me
2258262 to pick up a bunch of college sophomores is something i cant quite understand their minds and bodies will be fatigued
2258263 the big east conference will honor its founder and future naismith memorial basketball hall of fame inductee dave gavitt by hosting a very special tribute event at the rhode island convention center in providence on aug 10 beginning at 5 30 p m
2258264 at this point im down to pitt and ohio state both schools have a great deal to offer
2258265 it looks like i should have decision within the next two weeks i want to get to columbus and pittsburgh within the next two weeks and spend time with both coaching staffs ive already been to both schools a bunch of times but i think the final visit will help me separate the schools
2258266 i have been to pitt many times and im very familiar with their facilities and coaches the coaching staff there is great its close to home and they need offensive linemen
2258267 pitt has a big campus and you have to take shuttles to get to parts of it its a little more in the city compared to ohio states campus but thats not a big deal
2258268 just from all aspects it makes the most sense ill be able to learn the system in the next few months and that will be a big key for when im able to get back out there
2258269 he is going to visit kansas state and if he doesnt like it he already told cox that he will go to pitt
2258270 if cox was hired one day earlier beasley may have committed to pitt they won the aau national championship together and are very close
2258271 i had a lot of scholarship offers before i got involved with pitt they really werent in the picture until they hired panthers assistant coach mike rice
2258272 once coach rice got to pitt he started recruiting me as soon as he got there
2258273 i visited in late june 23rd when they held a camp there i loved everything about it the facilities were incredible and i liked the city and campus they showed me the classrooms dorms and thing like that as well i got to meet their two point guards ron ramon and levance fields they were nice guys
2258274 on the way home from pittsburgh i was heavily leaning towards committing to them i really liked it there and i felt comfortable it seemed like a good spot for me i got home and decided to commit to them david cox pitt director of basketball operations joining the staff made it that much easier
2258275 huffing and puffing and having trouble getting up and down the court
2258276 i want to be the best player i can be by the time i get to college
2258277 our academic rigors and integrity have never been called into question until now
2258278 were a high profile institution and were proud of the success that weve had with our young men and women
2258279 has enrolled for only one year or has a significant jump in his gpa in his third or fourth year
2258280 some of the students who attended there might get their records reviewed by the ncaa clearinghouse
2258281 a lot of people ask do you think you made the wrong decision
2258282 even into the morning i was still thinking about it
2258283 she said once you get to the nba youre going to have to kind of grow up and it might not be as much fun anymore
2258284 she said why dont you just stay have another year of fun enjoy your college life get your education now instead of later and just live it up the nba will still be there next year
2258285 he has different alternatives and different ways of getting the best out of his athletes
2258286 hell make sure theyll have the best conditioned team out there whatever talent is there hes going to raise the level 10 percent or more
2258287 back in the day in 1980 everyone was just winging it
2258288 darnell dodson is just starting to scratch the surface of what he can be down the road
2258289 he has grown in the last year and the expectations have grown he could be a 6 6 or 6 7 two guard if that happens the sky is the limit pittsburgh saw the upside that not a lot of other people saw if the kid works he can be a superstar
2258290 i know people wont believe that but its simply a bonus to have them together david cox is not really known as an aau coach as much as he is known as an assistant principal at washington st johns college high school
2258291 i can handle anything that life throws at me abdul said but if something happened to chase thats the one thing that would break me
2258292 the kid has been through a lifetime of heartache in a couple of years
2258293 you couldnt make this kind of stuff up its too unbelievable
2258294 i dont know if he has had a chance to kick with a clean bill of health and i mean mentally and physically since his freshman season
2258295 its exciting to have an opportunity to play that competition
2258296 we want to get to the point where when we play every one of those teams its a toss up were moving forward in that direction
2258297 im not sure what is going to happen but i dont want carl just going to an nba summer camp
2258298 theres nba interest in him but its not at the level id like
2258299 every college team in the country knows what players are returning and what players have left ive made my decision and i havent looked back
2258300 one of our biggest additions mike cook who sat out has gotten a taste of how competitive the big east is
2258301 he knows exactly what is going to happen theres going to be no surprises thats a big advantage to us and something were going to look forward to
2258302 our whole mind set as a team is weve got to get better
2258303 it was a learning process for a lot of us last season we were playing many times with three freshmen in the lineup so we were real inexperienced but we played the whole year knowing what things were going to be like
2258304 i played like eight minutes a game over my first two seasons
2258305 right now we realize the potential we have but we really havent done much
2258306 we understand if we want to get better theres a lot of things we have to change
2258307 we not only have to change our work ethic and how much we workout but also our mind set
2258308 we cant settle for making it to the big east championship game and losing
2258309 right now were just working as hard as we can to achieve them this season its going to be special man
2258310 i have gone back and forth with some favorite schools but im wide open for the most part
2258311 by april we said this kid is a i a player
2258312 some of the colleges said well follow him his senior year but pittsburgh and maryland came through with the offers
2258313 i have a lot of scholarship offers but three schools seem to stand out
2258314 i want to visit pitt auburn and tennessee and see what their campuses are like playing time is going to be important to me as well the panthers are putting together a power running game i like that a lot because it fits me style i like to pound the ball im a physical runner
2258315 it looks like the panthers offer me the most playing time i want to go to college and become the feature back it looks like that could happen in pittsburgh
2258316 three schools standout to me pittsburgh minnesota and wisconsin the panthers are still my favorite school i like their offense and i think i would fit into their scheme coach dave wannstedt would be great to play for
2258317 wisconsin and minnesota sound interesting and they really want me to visit i want to be thorough during the recruiting process so i owe them a visit i should take a look at them and compare them to pittsburgh they have been recruiting me pretty hard
2258318 hes up there now and loving it i think tj is going to make a big impact with them
2258319 it would be great to play with him and play together on the same offense
2258320 we visited pittsburgh on saturday and doug absolutely loved it
2258321 doug has scholarship offers from pitt wisconsin seems close to offering as well i received calls from miami fl today its rare to have the florida schools calling up here
2258322 doug would like to stay along with east cost his clear top three right now would be pittsburgh penn state and syracuse
2258323 doug was in absolute awe when he met coach dave wannstedt he had a grin from ear to ear coach wannstedt was in the middle of talking with us and he received a call from a big time offensive lineman
2258324 i just landed an offensive lineman to block for you
2258325 coach walker spent time talking with doug and showing us pitts offensive scheme their offense is exactly like the one we run and doug seems like a natural fit there hes a very powerful player hes a powerful north south runner that happens to be very quick laterally doug is unique you dont find many with his size and speed he has a side step that would remind you of marshal faulk
2258326 i just wanted to come back and give the kids an opportunity to be coached by professional coaches and to learn something about the importance of academics and character
2258327 weve got pro coaches and college coaches and weve got young coaches and old coaches
2258328 and weve got young offensive linemen and older offensive linemen young running backs and older running backs the camp was put together by bruce babich an aliquippa grad and now the he also coached the linebackers at pitt under johnny majors from 94 96 he has scary eyes
2258329 to be a division i athlete you have to stay focused on your grades and you have to stay focused on the things your parents are teaching you your parents will steer you on the right path stay with the positive stay away from the negative people who will drag you down
2258330 everything that i was listing all of the pros were just pitt and everything good i was saying was pitt pitt pitt
2258331 i have a good relationship with the coaches they are probably the greatest coaching staff ive met i like that its a big city
2258332 after i talked to pitt coach dave wannstedt on thursday i called mcdowell football coach joe tarasovitch and told him i wanted to commit he told me to sleep on it i went in coachs office and talked about it for about an hour yesterday and said this is the place where i want to go so i committed right then
2258333 i saw the campus and the city and saw it was beautiful
2258334 the facilities were outstanding i really like coach wannstedt and the other coaches and know they will be there for awhile
2258335 coach greg gattuso was recruiting me and he did a great job so i called and committed to him about 20 minutes ago
2258336 i told him i made my decision and i wanted to be a pitt panther he was excited and told me he was callin coach dave wannstedt
2258337 the coaches were great the facilities were great everyone there was friendly and i just felt like that was where i wanted to spend the next four years of my life at
2258338 i would like to graduate hopefully in early january and get to pitt early
2258339 i think it will help me for football and help me get a jump start on my education
2258340 i have narrowed my list to six schools at this time
2258341 i have visited all six schools over the last two weeks notre dame would be in the mix as well if they offer at this time im going to focus on the six schools i listed
2258342 it looks like ill make my decision on august 13th prior to our three a days pitt is heavily in the mix my mother is a big fan of the panthers and shes pushing for pitt
2258343 the last 24 hours have been crazy the whole offseason has been bizarre but it is what it is i am a member of the jets im excited about the opportunity
2258344 i was told by numerous people to at least talk to jets general manager mike tannenbaum and as i told him today i didnt talk to him until 24 hours ago because i knew i would be convinced
2258345 i think ill always be a packer people will say it was the best 16 years i think it was made clear this offseason that they were moving forward thats ok its time for me to move forward
2258346 hey bud you may be interested in checking out this amazing mens weekend it could change your life add more richly blue
2258347 it was clear from the moment i arrived at the new warrior training adventure in a mountain camp east of los angeles that this was no recreational retreat
2258348 we are an order of men called to reclaim the sacred masculine for our time through initiation training and action in the world
2258349 if this turns out badly i never have to see these men again
2258350 it is basically an attempt to leave dominant patriarchy and move to a more inclusive societal framework
2258351 an archetype according to websters is an original pattern or model from which other things of the same kind are made
2258352 in individual people the archetypes are derived from the experience of the human race and are present in the unconscious of the individual
2258353 the mature male is one who has integrated moore and gillettes four archetypes the king warrior magician lover and continues to confront the destructive shadow side of each the mature masculine of each archetype is toward the center of two opposite and destructive poles one active and one passive
2258354 for example the mature king energy integrates the tyrant and the weakling and the mature warrior integrates the sadist and the masochist
2258355 the new warriors grew out of a discussion of three men over ten years ago ron herring a therapist bill kauth a therapist and member of the mythopoetic mens movement and rich tosi a former marine captain they believed that men needed more masculine ways of dealing with feelings and that they needed to do this together
2258356 rites of passage provide recognized paths across the boundary separating childhood and adulthood and when completed the participant is recognized as an adult by his or her culture
2258357 the confirmation in the christian religion and the bar and bat mitzvahs of judaism are currently active rites of passage
2258358 they are done in the early teens however an age that is not recognized as adult in our society
2258359 the discontinuation of rites of passage results in a lack of connection between our youth and the rest of society
2258360 the news of the day including destructive and violent acts by young people who dont know how to behave in a civilized society
2258361 have their own gangs and their own initiations and their own morality and theyre doing the best they can but theyre dangerous because their own laws are not those of the city
2258362 this reflects an issue social workers see on a daily basis men who have no connection to an ethic or morality other than what i want is right and an ethic that says i can get what i want any way i want it
2258363 we need to study the possibility of programs to initiate young men into a mature masculinity that is nurturing and loving and encompasses smurls five aspects of ethics and morality theory self cultivation truth telling promise keeping beneficence or love and justice
2258364 what is at risk for you to give the people you know in your life sincere empowering feedback being assertive rather than remaining silent being passive or tearing them down being aggressive
2258365 every man who completes the new warrior training adventure weekend remembers what he did on that particular weekend of that particular year for the rest of his life
2258366 he wanted love with no involvement so he chased the wind thats all his silly life required and the days of vanity went on forever and he saw his days burn up like paper in fire
2258367 a disaster like this is not a punishment but a warning for everybody that we should be vigilant and should not put all our trust in what can be taken away in one day if not by the flood of water then by the flood of time time passes and will take everything
2258368 i thought i might be looking a few weeks or months at the most
2258369 lower end college graduates in middle management and certain professional positions
2258370 for 16 years i had no trouble at all finding jobs
2258371 a number of films that are quite conservative in philosophy
2258372 we are going to take it out of the hides of wall street
2258373 we want the abolition of the national banks and we want the power to make loans direct from the government
2258374 we want the accursed foreclosure system wiped out we will stand by our homes and stay by our firesides by force if necessary and we will not pay our debts to the loan shark companies until the government pays its debts to us
2258375 wall street is our bad example because it is so successful
2258376 provides us with new origination capabilities in the non prime market which we can build upon to provide access to high quality product flows across all market cycles
2258377 on tuesday we asked you to share your favorite windows maintenance tools and today were back with the five most popular answers

2258379 he had to get into my head just to become me and im not saying becoming a mini me but a maxi me
2258380 you have to put your ability to leak up against my ability to catch you
2258381 the nostrils would flare he would get very red faced and angry and you would just want to quit
2258382 it was the learning part that would always make you forget the part where you basically wanted to crash a chair over his head
2258383 our goal is perfection we will never achieve it our standard will be excellence we will meet it every day
2258384 at some point you felt like how many times can you say the same thing
2258385 the best way to assist me is by thinking exactly like me because i cannot think about everything
2258386 he had to be a second arnold out there running the campaign
2258387 all of a sudden hes the republican nominee for president of the united states and im one of four people standing in the room
2258388 at a minimum it seemed in bad form to say im going home now
2258389 a is aggressive like a giant finger pointing at you
2258390 it seems to have nothing to do with the whole idea of yachting which is about cruising around at a leisurely pace and enjoying your friends and the sea
2258391 a boat like this has never been done before and it will probably never be done again
2258392 physically it is more a fish than a building it is sort of a stealth yacht
2258393 those babies are sometimes put on acid reducing medications but they dont get better
2258394 theres no medicine for colic except time and mother nature
2258395 we should be looking for signs of treatable conditions so babies arent suffering needlessly
2258396 our position is that if the parents think their child is in significant pain they need to talk to their doctor
2258397 if you say my baby cries all the time the doctor may not take you seriously if you say my baby cried six hours yesterday and six hours the day before then they know its time to do something
2258398 when we went over the symptoms with him he said hed had this for as long as he could remember
2258399 i think weve all got post traumatic stress from that four months of screaming and no sleep
2258400 you can talk to parents 25 years later and theyll remember it like it was yesterday
2258401 i have a feeling that this painting is going to be very valuable
2258402 im really happy i was able to sell those and use the money to buy more art
2258403 obama is such an icon to the public already that would suggest that the work will be valuable no matter if he wins or loses its partially the hype of the times
2258404 whos to say that its unfair or unethical to try and sell a print to make a little extra money on the side
2258405 if we can make it through this we can get through the race
2258406 the problem with our sport is that people can understand a marathon people can understand an ironman
2258407 but when youre talking about doing that every day for 10 days people cant understand it
2258408 youll find that the winners are the most mentally fit
2258409 you cant think about work you cant think about family you cant think about emotional issues
2258410 she needs to learn to respect me as an athlete
2258411 being young and not really sure who i was i was looking for someone to take over
2258412 take a step back have a breath and stay focused
2258413 i still feel like doing handstands during work is a little inappropriate
2258414 is the antithesis of what yoga is about in terms of inner peace
2258415 its too far out of the box for our customers
2258416 but people often dont realize how much of what you feel is under your own control
2258417 today the dow closed down or up points and that made me feel
2258418 the first soldiers out of the trench are always machine gunned but somebody has to go first and im curious about this you try these things and see what happens
2258419 the money was rolling in and it was interesting because i didnt have a publisher and it didnt involve ink or a bindery
2258420 i just ran out of ideas it doesnt happen often and not usually in public
2258421 this isnt about reading a comic book on a tiny screen
2258422 tell me what you eat and i will tell you what you are
2258423 i really need to buy one of those maid carts like they really use at a hotel
2258424 this is as close to vacation as were gonna get
2258425 every single night my son asks me if we can camp out
2258426 with gas prices and the general cost of living sky high
2258427 it seems like ill be showering at home versus the hilton
2258428 tokyo ramen is going to be completely different from osaka ramen
2258429 god forbid i get confused and ask for the wrong one at the wrong restaurant
2258430 are celebrating at least a decade of being stuffed in the back of the same drawer
2258431 it seems that slips sort of went the same way that virginity went
2258432 what a slip says about its wearer today is fuddy duddy
2258433 walking around in diaphanous dresses with only a thong underneath
2258434 propriety is a word that just has no meaning today
2258435 reek of a bygone era of extreme modesty almost victorian
2258436 i finally had to ask my mom where i could buy one and what type i should get
2258437 now apologists for gypsies will inevitably drone what do you have against these people
2258438 thats where its joined so it is just the left arm you were right rex
2258439 i know that but im not so concerned about those

2258441 senator feinstein i assure you that the right to privacy is something i take very seriously i mean the fact that you had cornflakes for breakfast is of no interest to me whatsoever
2258442 senator levin ill repeat i simply cannot answer these questions national security and all that what i can say is that should a particular senator contract a raging bout of crabs they could simply remember the two ss 1 shampoo and 2 shave hypothetically speaking of course
2258443 senator uh what was your name again durbin social security number 443 91 9003 slept with your neighbors wife last fall mothers maiden name is jennings no no i havent seen todays post article on detainee treatment
2258444 have i knowingly broken the law during my tenure at the nsa
2258445 ambalals work may be seen within a critical phase of indian modernity his adaptations and resistance as he seeks to create a language that is both recognizable and intensely personal
2258446 i dont decide what to paint before hand the initial idea may be from a newspaper photograph i have seen in the morning or an antique sculpture then as i am painting something starts to grow inside that canvas and that takes on the final form on the canvas
2258447 the exotic island of bali has always intrigued me with its underlying likeness with our own visual culture the legends of mahabharata and ramayana are brought to life in the pictorial images that we see in far east as also the ajanta and ellora caves of india what is indeed fascinating about the far east culture is the harmonious relationship that man shares with nature resonating his acceptance to all its forms be it gods or demons vivid images of graceful women in temple processions and idiosyncratic protagonists human and otherwise thus find way on to my picture plane
2258448 the chinese authorities have done everything that is feasible and humanly possible to address this situation what they have done is extraordinary
2258449 the fog you see is based on humidity and heat it does not mean that this fog is the same as pollution
2258450 there is some moisture and fog out there but the air quality today is good
2258451 however we are missing the point by having so much attention on the short term exposure while the long term exposure is really ignored that is where we have a problem
2258452 it is a very small risk for visitors from outside and even less so for athletes because they are in very good shape
2258453 if you have a pre condition such as asthma or respiratory problem if the air is very polluted it could aggravate that
2258454 the positive thing about the olympics is that the government has taken action to try and decrease the air pollution
2258455 you can now store a host name in the default settings
2258456 make her known make her loved she will save the world
2258457 just keep your head down and things will be alright

2258459 we would be better off with only six million people we dont want all these extra people
2258460 we all know nuclear power isnt enough and drilling isnt enough
2258461 i knew nuclear power was safe then and i know its safe now
2258462 wait a minute didnt the los angeles class nuclear power submarine uss houston leak radioactive water earlier this year
2258463 he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
2258464 i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in we need electricity to plug into

2258471 as a consultant using your tools its our responsibility to make or save our clients money i often find that in order to do that i have to do a lot more than simply measure conversion funnels because all that does is show low hanging fruit which will only give you so much and only works for some sites
2258472 i want to appeal to the world community i urge russia to stop shelling georgias peaceful towns without delay georgia did not initiate this confrontation however georgia is not going to concede its territory
2258473 if we had no winter the spring would not be so pleasant if we did not sometimes taste of adversity prosperity would not be so welcome
2258474 shes got a lot of friends she brings groups shes just a wonderful lady theres no juice there there aint any juice
2258475 she has not worked at any time for ground zero
2258476 the rain came but it stopped the maize stopped growing we have nothing nothing i dont know what to do when you go to the store for food they want money
2258477 aids has been a contributor to the food shortage families lose their household heads the able bodied men and women what is left are grandparents who are at that time of their lives when they expect to retire and they often need care themselves but they must again raise a new generation of children the grandparents are too old to tend the fields and the children are too small
2258478 we engage in projects to assist people affected by aids since we started in 2003 at least one quarter of the money we earn from our agricultural and sewing projects goes to orphans
2258479 the danger facing orphans is neglect because the numbers are so high one out of five people in this country will be children under 15 orphaned after both parents die of aids and that will only be in two or three years where are the resources to take care of them
2258480 swaziland cannot cope on its own how can it no country could handle an aids crisis on top of a food and humanitarian crisis almost half of pregnant women in swaziland are hiv positive
2258481 it really takes so little to make them normal doesnt it
2258482 people across the nation are looking at the city and saying they cant govern themselves
2258483 chose the most extreme option available to him we chalk this up to the politically charged atmosphere
2258484 in terms of the sheer weight of the agony and aggravation hes been forced to contend with he needs to look at what is in his best interest
2258485 the first thing they said to me was is kwame going to make it
2258486 so instead of talking about all the good things were doing the conversation is all about the mayor that doesnt help me when i go out and try to market the region
2258487 i couldnt read what it said but what was on the front page a picture of kwame
2258488 men are inherently gentle intimate responsible enthusiastic sensual tolerant courageous honest vulnerable affectionate proud spiritual committed wild nurturing peaceful helpful intense compassionate happy and to fully and safely express all emotions when will we stop training him to be otherwise
2258489 a constant struggle between self affirmation and dependence on god we can either depend on god and be free from circumstances or be free from god and enslaved to everything
2258490 this is the victory that conquers the world our faith
2258491 that while we were still sinners christ died for us
2258492 significantly the synod fathers stated that the christian faithful need a fuller understanding of the relationship between the eucharist and their daily lives
2258493 how do you know a great entrepreneur when you meet one
2258494 what then is a negawatt a negawatt is a megawatt of electricity that you dont use huh
2258495 it turns out that thinking in terms of graphs is far easier than thinking in terms of tables and relations
2258496 a lot of cookbook publishers say that adding weights tends to look daunting and a lot of cookbook publishers try to keep things simple
2258497 american golf is not necessarily monotonous but it usually doesnt require as much creativity or thought processes as links golf does
2258498 when you play golf in america the challenges tend to be defined i hit my seven iron from 155 yards to 165 yards and in this country when im that distance away from the hole thats usually the club i use but on a links course theres no telling what club ill need from that distance
2258499 its a feel game a judgment game over there rather than something mechanical
2258500 its all about controlling the trajectories of your shots and playing the contours of the land
2258501 when players get to the tee you want to play with their minds a little bit by giving them options and forcing them to make decisions
2258502 weve lost that a little bit in this country but its coming back
2258503 not to take anything away from our national championship the u s open but this is the oldest championship in the world for some reason its always intrigued me
2258504 really shouldnt happen because we dont see that type of golf over here
2258505 but i think the players get there and are intrigued and excited by all the different types of shots they need to hit probably also they dont feel the expectations that the europeans do and the next thing they know they have a chance to win
2258506 i had about 14 feet for birdie and as i was lining up the putt i knew that tiger was watching on tv in the clubhouse and i thought im going to pour this putt in just to tick him off
2258507 i was nervous and didnt know whether i was going to win the tournament or not but i knew i needed to finish in front of tiger for sure so i kind of used that match play mind set me versus tiger to make that putt and par the final hole
2258508 another cool thing i remember about that year was flying back home on tigers plane
2258509 obama is going to be the point person in this election
2258510 voters want to answer a simple question is barack obama safe
2258511 this is not obamas race to lose its his to win
2258512 voters have a sense they know what theyre going to get if they elect john mccain but an uncertainty about barack obama that they are trying to sort through
2258513 i see obama as a very nice person but i dont believe he has the experience at this time to be president
2258514 hes new hes young and he still has a lot to learn i believe
2258515 im a white bread american i was raised in iowa i got the midwestern work ethic
2258516 hes a black man his name is unique its definitely not a catholic name hes kind of way off the pattern of the norm of what i grew up with thats not necessarily a bad thing just because i cant relate to the person doesnt mean its a bad thing
2258517 we still have at this late date in the campaign a lot of voters who dont know a lot about obama in terms of his values and background
2258518 there are a lot of people who are going to play a pivotal role in the election who dont know he was raised by a single mom and whose grandparents were from kansas not of great means who struggled financially i think sometimes people think hes led some kind of charmed existence and nothing could be further from the truth
2258519 i dont want to find out after hes elected that hes got some kind of islamic connection i dont think thats true but you never know
2258520 america is a country of strong families and strong values
2258521 my lifes been blessed by both i was raised by a single mom and my grandparents we didnt have much money but they taught me values straight from the kansas heartland where they grew up
2258522 positions that helped him win his nomination now obama is changing to help himself become president
2258523 people dont know what he really believes which makes him a big question mark
2258524 obviously were going to have to deal with their increasingly negative attacks
2258525 i just dont think were ready for a black president
2258526 airlines or really any organization need a rallying cry especially one that has been the worst of the worst for so long
2258527 and was very pleasantly surprised to find myself on a clean new airplane with happy staff ive usually avoided us air because those items have been in short supply
2258528 keeping folks on a plane for 5 hours is just inhumane its horrible
2258529 lets face it there was a lot of finger pointing
2258530 there had to be a panda even though youd think the public would have had enough of them
2258531 the fact that friendlies sounds like friendless is another flaw
2258532 also embody the natural characteristics of four of chinas most popular animals
2258533 why do the olympic mascots have to look like some mutant pokemon telletubbie thing
2258534 whats wrong with a bull dog or a cougar or a sweat shop worker for a mascot
2258535 the first thing that people need to remember is that mascots are aimed at kids
2258536 it is only the cynical older people that kind of dont like them
2258537 can you believe it those are the drafts that they sent through and asked me to modify
2258538 i liked children instead of animals because the love of children is the greatest love
2258539 when you confront the powers that be there is no respect for the artist they all kind of jump on it to have their way
2258540 used it as a mascot for potholes and for not having the venues ready
2258541 i was supposed to be paid one yuan for making the fuwa but havent yet even gotten that
2258542 some of these democrats are trying to walk a fine line
2258543 he helps us change our image and recasts us as a maverick party interested in change
2258544 midwest freshmen probably would have been better off running with clinton
2258545 a lot of my discretionary income was going into air
2258546 people are trying to find ways to take control of their own energy destiny
2258547 i dont know if its all that good for the life span of the roof

2258550 with our brothers and sisters throughout the world who have no electricity much less air conditioning
2258551 it goes beyond just a wonderful sporting occasion there are political and economic implications
2258552 for those who wish to be important in business in china for the next 20 years people in china will ask you if you were here during the olympics
2258553 this is chinas national achievement test their way of telling the world weve achieved
2258554 one area in which people say organizers have fallen short of expectations
2258555 beijing is far safer than most places in the u s
2258556 the reason why im the nominee of the republican party
2258557 is the close interaction i had with citizens all over the country
2258558 you didnt vote on the new g i bill and you spoke out against it
2258559 sir im responding to your question and then i will let you speak again
2258560 the way we try to conduct these is let people finish and then go back to you
2258561 ill be happy to examine what your version of my record is
2258562 ill look at you in the eye again and tell you that theres some jobs that wont come back
2258563 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
2258564 but it was really hard to convince people that cartoon art was worth saving and worth looking at
2258565 fighting for the cartoons and fighting for cartooning as a legitimate art form hes been tireless
2258566 there was ice on the dining room floor you could skate on it
2258567 anyone who enjoys asparagus is missing out if they havent tried the asparagus we grow in washington
2258568 it has been a very bitter pill for our industry
2258569 that drug control policy has come on the backs of our farmers
2258570 i know it is some of the best in the world and i appreciate your thinking of me
2258571 if we succeed we will not only have a way to find the leonardo
2258572 but we will have a technology that could detect murals world wide
2258573 you are working in the symbol of the renaissance in florence in a monument that is in use practically every day
2258574 we can see the textures of the old walls arches and windows under the plaster we can see if they are bricks or stone because one is cooler than the other
2258575 we are talking about the masterpiece of the masterpieces of the renaissance
2258576 way more important than the last supper or the mona lisa
2258577 one writer at the time says it is the most beautiful thing in existence twice as beautiful as the ceiling in the sistine chapel
2258578 for me a work of art is like a patient
2258579 i was fascinated by the use of technology to find and preserve a masterpiece
2258580 i suggest that all chinese employees in tbwa resign from this company
2258581 the result was not suitable for the messages we are trying to convey with our olympics campaign
2258582 had tbwa management known about this ad not only would the ad not have been entered into an award show but it would not have been produced
2258583 this is the action of one individual at our agency working on a pro bono account
2258584 it is an unavoidable consequence of being a global network with lots and lots of clients
2258585 but now especially at the high end of the market they are buying big apartments so they are a significant factor
2258586 i liked it there so much i bought the apartment next to the hotel
2258587 my wife and i spend three months a year there in between our tours
2258588 a small community its the same people who have been to the same schools

2258593 in berlin obama neared self parody with a rhetoric of leave no metaphor behind
2258594 hey i am in a meeting can i call you back in a minute
2258595 yeah actually i have few pairs of eyeglasses i want to match my eyeglasses with my dress code daily
2258596 screw georgia putin and russia know how to deal with radicals
2258597 he was elected over republican bob beauprez with a very significant amount of republican support and a strong number of unaffiliated voters he appeared at that time to be more conservative and not so controversial
2258598 one of the factors is that even in colorado which to some extent has been immune to the repercussions of the declining economy its finally caught up to us

2258602 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2258603 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2258604 we respect bretts decision that he could no longer remain here as a packer but there were certain things we were not willing to do because they were not in the best interest of the team we were not going to release him nor trade him to a team within the division when brett ultimately decided that he still wanted to play football but not in green bay we told him that we would work to find the best solution for all parties involved we wish brett and his family well
2258605 we got to a spot where we felt comfortable with things
2258606 really we had a cursory monitoring situation going on we just kind of put an oar in the water
2258607 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field
2258608 mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process
2258609 how is love best shown to you kind of like what is your love language
2258610 what imprint or signature do you want to leave on the hearts of our students
2258611 revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law
2258612 as an extraordinarily fair open and just process that produces a reliable result
2258613 for a team that was expected to strike out at every pitch
2258614 we play the game in our league the way it was supposed to be played
2258615 be honest with yourself self deception might be keeping you single its a well known fact that we tend to pair off with members of the opposite sex that are roughly equal to us in terms of physical attractiveness this is natures way of ensuring the survival of the species
2258616 right now we feel like weve got the right checks and controls in place
2258617 a lot of people criticize what urban development means but its good that theres a debate
2258618 i like the idea of having a perfectly folded closet
2258619 over the past 10 or more years the trend has definitely been to more folding
2258620 i still kind of have the urge to do it
2258621 everyone makes fun of romey for his folding habits because its so weird
2258622 they are difficult to fold like folding a batman cape
2258623 i wanted to have a face lift but i was on a very tight budget
2258624 with the exchange rate in favor of most european currencies cosmetic surgery in new york has become more affordable and less expensive than in europe
2258625 the psychological cachet of having something done in new york or l a carries weight with many europeans
2258626 we are willing to try other markets because of whats happening
2258627 im not sure if its the nice euro exchange rate
2258628 one of dicks virtues is that he can be strongly opinionated he is a rhinoceros and he attacks with his horn ready for combat
2258629 what makes it difficult to work for nbc is that theyre like a pack of wolves always nipping at the rhinoceross heels
2258630 it never particularly appealed to what you would call a young demographic
2258631 all networks are alike in the fact that once they have a successful show they want to keep it and repeat it over and over and make it at the lowest possible cost to them
2258632 literally all the bad things that the studios were saying the networks would do if they had the financial interest and syndication rules taken away everybody kind of doubted it sounded like hyberbole
2258633 loosely put after youve lost weight you have more of an emotional response to food and less ability to control that response
2258634 i cant look at these scans and say in 30 seconds youre going to eat a banana
2258635 these people act as if they are hungrier and combined with reduced energy expenditure thats the perfect storm for gaining weight
2258636 is not free will its biologically determined and the species that didnt have this are the ones you see in the museum of natural history
2258637 now anyone can summon an unlimited amount of food just with a cellphone
2258638 the models we have for what is happening in the neuron are a lot better than they were 20 years ago
2258639 but even the best models we have are not sufficiently rich to capture everything that is going on in some ways we are barely scratching the surface
2258640 but we still have no idea of how it works no overall view of how the animal functions
2258641 it treads right on the edge of what i would call unethical behavior
2258642 you dont sell back your dictionary after your first year of college
2258643 it should be a resource they have on their shelf
2258644 we didnt come to the market to give departments royalties
2258645 we think theres a decent argument to be made for it its a nice bonus for colleges to have a couple of extra bucks to use for education
2258646 in all more than 800 000 images were stitched together into a mosaic of the milky ways galactic plane that takes in 120 degrees of width and just 2 degrees of height
2258647 this page contains high resolution images from the spitzer space telescope which you can interactively zoom into and pan around
2258648 there has not been much change from last year and last year was not a stellar year
2258649 there are a lot of things in place that we think are making a difference
2258650 i actually rumpled the sheets to make myself feel like i had a room even though i got no sleep
2258651 the best long term solution remains increasing the capacity the aviation system is capable of handling
2258652 there are some airlines really suffering this year as much as we did last year or even more
2258653 its going to take five years to fully implement all the changes for the new york new jersey airspace
2258654 not only did they cheat us out of our time in paris but they didnt do anything to help us
2258655 due to soaring oil prices the u s current account deficit
2258656 has doubled since 2001 this excess consumption has been financed by huge capital inflows from emerging asia and oil exporting countries
2258657 when oil prices were lower these countries channeled the bulk of their oil profits into domestic spending with little left over to invest abroad
2258658 but as crude prices have climbed these five countries are emerging as significant investors in foreign markets they accounted for nearly one quarter of net capital outflows from oil exporters in 2007
2258659 the rise of a broader range of countries with sovereign wealth funds heightens concerns about the potential noneconomic motives and political ramifications of their investments
2258660 it is very hard to push your creditors to be democratic
2258661 when we buy foreign oil we are enriching some of our worst enemies
2258662 corrupts budding democracies and allows dictators from hostile regimes to threaten the international community
2258663 there seems to be a feeling that men are getting a little more experimental and that things are speeding up from the time you see things on the runways to the time you see guys wearing the trends on the street
2258664 sometimes you see guys with their trousers and you wonder who their tailor is theyre way too long
2258665 i tried to play with that and do the total opposite
2258666 the more formal the fabric the more it looks like a mistake
2258667 you start to go did his dry cleaner make a mistake or did he outgrow them
2258668 when you are walking or sitting down you feel like things are too high
2258669 when you roll them up you can unroll them if you change your mind or if the trend goes out of style
2258670 you get less house and property for the same price but were willing to make that sacrifice to save on gas prices and commuting costs
2258671 i think it is really silly to have hot lanes part way through virginia ending at the american legion bridge and then we dont have anything on the other side of the bridge
2258672 we cant just dismiss these things out of hand because we dont think it sounds nice
2258673 i dont know what the right answer is but at least we need to understand the next steps and how to do it
2258674 fear not for i am with you i have called you by name you are mine
2258675 i need my rest if this is the real thing

2258691 you dont need to read weese just feed it cmon you know you want to look at johns yard next door
2258692 did you know us lawns take up as much space as the entire state of new york and that 1 3 of all the water on the east coast is used to water lawns

2258694 so we feed and water a lawn to make it grow only to cut it back every week does that sound silly to you

2258774 most white participants were distressed by this perceived decline in britishness they felt victimised and frustrated and many anticipated that social unrest would become inevitable

2258777 saying goodbye is never easy ive enjoyed the generous support of ballard spahr for my creative endeavors ive received much encouragement over the years from the legal community my peers have kindly awarded my efforts
2258778 but the demands of managing a web site increasingly took me away from my first love providing library and research services to lawyers
2258779 while the decision to close the virtual chase was not made lightly im convinced its the best choice for both the firm and me i will take down the site gradually over the next several months unless i find someone willing to archive it or continue its development i anticipate that the site will be completely offline by no later than may 2009 and quite possibly sooner except in the event of a new owner
2258780 one of my primary focuses now is to concentrate on the needs of corporate counsel in developing the relationship community and tools aspects of this
2258781 one of the biggest differences in a successful professional networking site is that a social one doesnt really engage a professional in any meaningful long term way
2258782 we need to build business tools to help them do their jobs more efficiently and effectively
2258783 that is 45 million instances of suggested connections among lawyers we think may want to be connected with each other
2258784 i may be able to see a lawyers public rating but i care more about ratings from people i work with heres a way we can provide that

2258796 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
2258797 theres no reason except for the sake of red meat for his base to throw up screens in the way of children in foster care getting homes
2258798 sen mccain would deny loving homes to children who desperately need them simply because of an outdated prejudice about what a family may look like
2258799 it is an insult to these professionals and the children whom they represent to suggest that the door should be closed to people other than a traditional married couple
2258800 his implication is that every adopted child should have a mother and father
2258801 that may be the ideal but if we stick to it we would have far fewer homes for kids single people gay and straight represent a significant number of adoptive parents
2258802 if sen mccain came and sat down with us id tell him weve proven that both parents are important in our family

2258811 the world considers anyone a kantian who is interested in the latest german philosophical writings according to the school definition a kantian is only someone who believes that kant is the truth and who if the mail coach from konigsberg were to ever have an accident might very well have to go without the truth for some weeks according to the outmoded socratic concept of disciples being those who have independently made the spirit of the great master their own spirit have adapted themselves to it and as his spiritual sons have been named after him there are probably only a very few kantians
2258812 he really asked what kind of thinking can happen in a language how has it been limited and neglected in philosophy
2258813 this of course meant that derrida was accused especially by anglo saxon intellectuals of destroying the distinction between fiction and reality
2258814 there are a myriad of benefits to sitestar from this acquisition

2258816 as sharepoint deployments grow in size and complexity governance is mission critical

2258821 we are sending a perpetrator letter to those involved in domestic abuse and we are wanting to use that in other areas of violence
2258822 we tell them that their bail condition will be policed it also says you should get help and advice on anger management or alcohol addiction the proposal is to extend that into other areas
2258823 if we interact with someone on the cusp of violence we will send a letter to them too the emphasis is not on the process but on getting a positive outcome for the victim
2258824 we will carry out a home visit within the 24 hour period following your release from court and thereafter carry out a series of unannounced visits in the period applicable to your bail conditions
2258825 repeat victimisation for those suffering domestic abuse is a big problem we are pro actively going to that door to check that person is not there
2258826 for a variety of reasons men are often allowed back to the house
2258827 if you look at the number of people who are repeat victims it makes that worthwhile
2258828 success is the result of action directed toward a desired goal
2258829 the price of success is hard work dedication to the job at hand and the determination that whether we win or lose we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand
2258830 nothing in the world can take the place of persistence talent will not nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent genius will not un rewarded genius is almost a proverb education will not the world is full of educated derelicts persistence and determination alone are omnipotent
2258831 there is genius in persistence it conquers all opposers it gives confidence it annihilates obstacles everybody believes in a determined man people know that when he undertakes a thing the battle is half won for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do
2258832 if you believe you can you probably can if you believe you wont you most assuredly wont belief is the ignition switch that gets you off the launching pad
2258833 if you develop the absolute sense of certainty that powerful beliefs provide then you can get yourself to accomplish virtually anything
2258834 the size of your success is determined by the size of your belief think little goals and expect little achievements think big goals and win big success remember this too big ideas and big plans are often easier certainly no more difficult than small ideas and small plans
2258835 the entrepreneur is essentially a visualizer and an actualizer he can visualize something and when visualizes it he sees exactly how to make it happen

2258843 its incredible to think that we might be the only intelligent living system in the universe thats not credible anymore
2258844 military pilots airline pilots mostly from all over the world for 50 years have reported these things but theyve quit because theyre told to shut up and not talk about it by military and intelligence people
2258845 unfortunately you the press show no interest whatsoever the giggle factor has been too high but the science behind it and the research behind it among the people i know is accepted its real
2258846 ive been saying the same damn words for 10 years almost verbatim and all of a sudden here im global news
2258847 it would be pretty darn exciting i have been hoping for that type of experience since i got involved in this
2258848 they really should be doing something to help the american people theres only so much the average person can do and the government is not going to be doing anything
2258849 ive definitely cut back on my driving im not taking as many vacations as i would like to
2258850 obviously if the oil companies are making record profits they are messing with somebody and that somebody is us
2258851 i dont regret it because i didnt do anything bad
2258852 i was in my pits and she came with a bad attitude and bad language and it was my reaction
2258853 its an incident that i want to forget already because it was not necessary to happen
2258854 we are a role model for many people we are an inspiration and this is not the image that i want to give to somebody the people dont know me for having these problems
2258855 i dont want to talk about the situations that shes had before because its not part of my business
2258856 greyhound knows how important it is to get these removed and we are doing everything possible
2258857 this abandonment is most often the result of physical and emotional issues not because of any underlying ideological concerns that they have with torah judaism
2258858 i see haredi women who sit at the back as being the israeli rosa parks
2258859 we see it as a stand against the deterioration of standards in the public arena and view the chance to sit at the back without men gazing at us as a form of empowerment
2258860 we orthodox jews are not too strict the talmud is only 5 422 pages long
2258861 today i saw that girl who in an earlier post i said how she was pissy with me her name is whine someshitlikethatiforgotexactly
2258862 the more we talk about what we do the more we expose the shibboleths and the more maybe we can get back to respecting the institution

2258866 worlds largest devoted to answering other lawyers questions about the professional networking site in a recent post he explains his claim to the worlds largest lawyer network
2258867 the worlds largest linkedin lawyer network refers to how many lawyers are in my personal directly connected network which currently consists of 3400 members and 1450 lawyers
2258868 knols are authoritative articles about specific topics written by people who know about those subjects
2258869 the key principle behind knol is authorship every knol will have an author or group of authors who put their name behind their content its their knol their voice their opinion we expect that there will be multiple knols on the same subject and we think that is good
2258870 a knol on a particular topic is meant to be the first thing someone who searches for this topic for the first time will want to read
2258871 im sweating and my knees hurt it is good to be back
2258872 i played basketball last night won some games lost some games had fun blah blah
2258873 category upon reading this discussion i just started to flame lol
2258874 the president has done much to our country and we all know that
2258875 but of course we know they have done something good too
2258876 but not as many as the ones with negative effects to the people
2258877 you cannot say that the government is just wasting money
2258878 what does this young person mean to make of me
2258879 to dissect a body or event down to its first elements
2258880 no aspect of criticism is more certain than that which has been invented for gold and silver therefore no confusion in germany can be as great as that which has crept into all the usual text books
2258881 merely comes to the aid of the work of the mother and her ripe fruit and assists both
2258882 therefore the greatest men of his time had sufficient reason to cry that he would fell all the oaks of their woods spoil all their logs and could only make shavings of their timber
2258883 one cannot feel a lively friendship without sensuality and a metaphysical love perhaps sins more coarsely against the nerves than an animal love against flesh and blood
2258884 the pagans were accustomed to such contradictions from the clever fables of their poets until their sophists like ours damned them as they would a parricide which one commits against the basic principles of human knowledge
2258885 the ancient and modern sceptics may swaddle themselves in the lion skin of socratic ignorance as much as they like but they betray themselves by their voices and ears
2258886 he is ignorant even of the shame which haunts rational people of seeming ignorant
2258887 faith arises as little from reason as tasting and feeling
2258888 there are proofs of truths which are as worthless as the use to which these truths can be put indeed one can believe the proof of a proposition without applauding the proposition itself
2258889 fate places the greatest philosophers and poets in circumstances where they both feel and the one renounces his reason and reveals to us that he does not believe in the best of all possible worlds no matter how well he can prove it and the other finds himself robbed of his muse and his guardian angel with the death of his meta
2258890 he had a genie on whose knowledge he could rely whom he loved and feared as his god whose peace mattered more to him than all the reason of the egyptians and the greeks whose voice he believed
2258891 what one believes has therefore no need of proof and a proposition can be irrefutably proven without being believed
2258892 the reasonings of a hume may be convincing and their refutations clear postulates and doubts but faith both wins and loses greatly by this most skilful pettifogger and most honourable attorney
2258893 it was so exciting to have made it to the finals
2258894 i really had to fight to have the opportunity to share my jokes with the country but even before america spoke i kind of already won

2258897 ive been waiting to see if you spoke southern as you dont in your spanish
2258898 instead of a telephone poll to decide which state is fatter the cdc needs to rent the georgia dome and host an olympic style competition of all 50 states we might not win the 400 meter relay every time but we could kick butt in the shot pu dead lift and pie eating contest
2258899 two bits four bits gumbo roux you better look out or well sit on you
2258900 you must tolerate our religion and we have the right to reject yours
2258901 my religion my way of life and my morals are absolutely correct
2258902 it is this way because i believe it to be
2258903 most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion you will go to hell since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion we can project that all souls go to hell
2258904 i dont want to speculate about the existence of the above to me we do our hell on earth for the too religious amongst us if you thrive on self immolation or a fire loving
2258905 it has been bad enough with all the leaks from doctors and police sources about elisabeth
2258906 but that her father who caused all her suffering means to cash in on her ordeal is sickening
2258907 she is appalled it is like being violated all over again
2258908 he is a monster trying to present a human face but it will be at the cost to her fragile psyche
2258909 he knows that his story is worth a lot because elisabeth has made it clear that she does not want to sell her story
2258910 rick how much of that time you spend in washington was on capitol hill and how much was on k street where you were the lead dealer in the biggest insider lobbyist game in town
2258911 ya know rick thats all youve got to show for 12 years in the us senate
2258912 something usually isnt that important whats important is that picture which hits the national wire if youre lucky and can lean in far enough you wont be cropped by some nasty photo editor
2258913 a government animal testing facility very close by in long island
2258914 we would drink together and smoke together and its just a bad deal its not something that is conducive to being a role model no iconic actors that i know of have problems like that and i dont know how to do it like a gentleman i dont know how to have one drink
2258915 so that the police could have his sandwich made to his specifications
2258916 so in our timidity let each of us make a choice whether consciously to remain a servant of falsehood of course it is not out of inclination but to feed ones family that one raises his children in the spirit of lies or to shrug off the lies and become an honest man worthy of respect both by ones children and contemporaries and from that day onward he will not henceforth write sign or print in any way a single phrase which in his opinion distorts the truth will utter such a phrase neither in private conversation not in the presence of many people neither on his own behalf not at the prompting of someone else either in the role of agitator teacher educator not in a theatrical role will not depict foster or broadcast a single idea which he can only see is false or a distortion of the truth whether it be in painting sculpture photography technical science or music will not cite out of context either orally or written a single quotation so as to please someone to feather his own nest to achieve success in his work if he does not share completely the idea which is quoted or if it does not accurately reflect the matter at issue will not allow himself to be compelled to attend demonstrations or meetings if they are contrary to his desire or will will neither take into hand not raise into the air a poster or slogan which he does not completely accept will not raise his hand to vote for a proposal with which he does not sincerely sympathize will vote neither openly nor secretly for a person whom he considers unworthy or of doubtful abilities will not allow himself to be dragged to a meeting where there can be expected a forced or distorted discussion of a question will immediately talk out of a meeting session lecture performance or film showing if he hears a speaker tell lies or purvey ideological nonsense or shameless propaganda will not subscribe to or buy a newspaper or magazine in which information is distorted and primary facts are concealed of course we have not listed all of the possible and necessary deviations from falsehood but a person who purifies himself will easily distinguish other instances with his purified outlook no it will not be the same for everybody at first some at first will lose their jobs for young people who want to live with truth this will in the beginning complicate their young lives very much because the required recitations are stuffed with lies and it is necessary to make a choice but there are no loopholes for anybody who wants to be honest on any given day any one of us will be confronted with at least one of the above mentioned choices even in the most secure of the technical sciences either truth or falsehood toward spiritual independence or toward spiritual servitude

2258925 a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you
2258926 well dear friends you know that some men can do to the glory of god what to other men would be sin and notwithstanding what brother pentecost has said i intend to smoke a good cigar to the glory of god before i go to bed to night
2258927 if anybody can show me in the bible the command thou shalt not smoke i am ready to keep it but i havent found it yet i find ten commandments and its as much as i can do to keep them and ive no desire to make them into eleven or twelve

2258930 yahoo understands the trust of our users is our greatest asset so we strive to create the most trusted compelling online experience
2258931 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
2258932 however we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them even greater choice
2258933 projections for growth of our paid subscriber base were low compared to the growth of online advertising
2258934 because it is a dynamic environment where new demands arise all the time we decided to replicate here the service outsourcing model implemented in the headquarters in france this will allow us to gain more flexibility and focus our efforts and investments on our core business

2258937 these stories seem at times to be stories of a long lost world when the city of new york was still filled with river light when you heard benny goodman quartets from a radio in the corner stationery store and when almost everybody wore a hat here is the last of that generation of chain smokers who woke the world in the morning with their coughing who used to get stoned at cocktail parties and perform obsolete dance steps like the cleveland chicken sail for europe on ships who were truly nostalgic for love and happiness and whose gods were as ancient as yours and mine whoever you are

2259283 igualmente inici las acciones intentando lograr la unificaci n de las fuerzas de tito con las fuerzas en serbia y todos aquellos que se encuentran con el gobierno mon rquico serbio el mismo que ambos hemos reconocido en todas las fases ha estado informado acerca de c mo conllevamos esa dif cil carga misma que actualmente descansa sobre nosotros ah nada ser a m s sencillo que aventarle al rey y su gobierno real a los lobos y permitir que en yugoslavia estalle una guerra civil con toda la simpat a de parte de alemania yo en ambos casos intento crear algo de orden en todo ese caos y que todos los esfuerzos se unifiquen en contra del enemigo com n
2259284 a n se estaban llevando a cabo batallas intensas entre los partisanos y las tropas de mihailovi cuyas fuerzas se basan en la ayuda alemana y b lgara y que la paz no era probable
2259285 no pod amos traicionar al rey tito dijo que entend a la obligaci n que ten amos hacia el rey petar pero que en ese sentido nada pod a hacer hasta que terminara la guerra momento en el cual ser a el pueblo yugoslavo el que tuviera que decidir su futuro
2259286 posteriormente empec a hablar acerca del futuro y opin que la soluci n correcta para yugoslavia tendr a que ser un sistema basado en el campesinado adem s de a lo mejor una paulatina reforma agraria en lugares d nde las propiedades fueran demasiado peque as tito me convenc a que como ya lo hab a declarado p blicamente no tiene deseo alguno de establecer en yugoslavia un sistema comunista con m s raz n si en la posguerra la mayor a de los pa ses iban a ser regidos por reg menes democr ticos los acontecimientos en los pa ses peque os dependen de las relaciones de las grandes potencias yugoslavia estar en posibilidades de aprovecharse de las cada vez mayores mejor as en tales relaciones y desarrollarse en una direcci n democr tica los rusos tienen una misi n con los partisanos sin embargo sus miembros lejos de defender cualquier idea acerca del establecimiento del sistema sovi tico en yugoslavia se declararon en contra de ello le pregunt a tito si le gustar a comprobar tal declaraci n acerca del comunismo p blicamente pero l no quiso hacer tal cosa ya que parecer a que hubiera sido obligado a dar tal declaraci n sin embargo acordamos que hablara de tal sugerencia con el dr uba i con qui n ten a a bien reunirse por primera vez esa tarde
2259287 los yugoslavos se disgustaron conmigo por haber opinado que el movimiento de los partisanos es separado del pueblo serbio no insist en ello sobre todo porque tito hab a dicho estar dispuesto a declarar p blicamente que en yugoslavia despu s de la guerra no se establecer a el r gimen comunista posteriormente discutimos acerca de la posibilidad de la reuni n entre tito y el rey petar dije que la democracia florec a en inglaterra bajo la monarqu a constitucional y que opino que la posici n internacional de yugoslavia ser a m s fuerte bajo un rey que si se volviera cualquier rep blica tito dijo que su pa s tuvo una p sima experiencia con su rey y que se necesitar a tiempo para que el rey petar con sus actitudes pudiera borrar de la memoria del pueblo sus relaciones con mihailovi l tito en principio no tiene nada en contra de reunirse con el rey pero opina que a n no es el momento as decidimos encomendarles a l y a uba i el decidir ese momento
2259288 s lo la alianza ins lita y temporal del capitalismo liberal y el comunismo para hacer frente a ese desaf o permiti salvar la democracia pues la victoria sobre la alemania de hitler fue esencialmente obra no podr a haber sido de otro modo del ej rcito rojo desde una multiplicidad de puntos de vista este per odo de alianza entre el capitalismo y el comunismo contra el fascismo fundamentalmente las d cadas de 1930 y 1940 es el momento decisivo en la historia del siglo xx
2259289 el momento era propicio para la terminaci n de negocios as que dije
2259290 acaso no se tomar como bastante c nico de nuestra parte si llegara a parecer que cuestiones tan trascendentes para millones de personas las hayamos resuelto de una manera tan sencilla quememos el papel
2259291 el resultado m s perdurable de la revoluci n de octubre cuyo objetivo era acabar con el capitalismo a escala planetaria fuera el de haber salvado a su enemigo ac rrimo tanto en la guerra como en la paz al proporcionarle el incentivo el temor para transformarse desde dentro al terminar la segunda guerra mundial y al dar difusi n al concepto de planificaci n econ mica suministrando al mismo tiempo algunos procedimientos necesarios para su reforma

2259347 while the asset flow in the managed futures sector has increased significantly over the last several years we still feel that there is a need for a firm that is able to provide a consultative approach to managed futures portfolios the goal is not to recommend cookie cutter type portfolios for every investor but to look at the investors individual profile and portfolio to determine the specific allocation that is most appropriate for the investor this approach is especially attractive to institutions and investors that have to meet specific portfolio requirements

2259358 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2259359 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had
2259360 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport
2259361 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year
2259362 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2259363 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2259364 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2259365 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page
2259366 there is no no 1 driver what has made this team work i think is that there isnt that its the four working together have we had that all year this year no has there had to be some reminders yes
2259367 but i would say most of the races we have worked together and those were where we had our best races thats constantly a challenge obviously you have four drivers that want to win sometimes youve got to remind them that if they all work together that all four can get better

2259381 in all societies protest begins from some point and in the beginning protests are not usually large protests can be very small in their initial stage when they are being formed but if small protests are not met with a reasonable and wise reaction gradually they turn into movements that can sometimes take the form of a riot in the current situation it seems that such reactions have not been successful in ceasing these demands irans laws should be reconsidered its not only the women who are unhappy about these laws

2259384 exploiting pkk incursions as an excuse to hit back at northern iraq and warn iraqi kurds that turkey will not tolerate similar ambitions in its occupied territory the turkish deployment has boosted an already large garrison in the kurdish region of turkey north kurdistan to what some estimate to be a force of 250 000 soldiers iranian troops recently fired artillery shells across the border north of suleymaniyah and claimed that it was a response to ncursions by pkk
2259385 with israel having withdrawn from lebanon and gaza and with israeli public opinion virtually united in favor of near total withdrawal from the west bank why are rockets being launched at israel now why are their soldiers being kidnapped if the aspirations of the palestinian people and the intentions of hamas and hezbollah stand for something other than the total destruction of israel and if palestinians and the lebanese are electing terrorists and giving them the portfolio of statesmen then what message is being sent to moderate voices what incentives are there to negotiate and how can any of this sobering news be recast in a more favorable light
2259386 the jewish left is now in shambles peace now advocates have lost their momentum and in some sense their moral clarity opinion polls in israel are showing near unanimous support for stronger incursions into lebanon and until kidnapped soldiers are returned and acts of terror curtailed any further conversations about the future of the west bank have been set aside
2259387 this reticence in naming the focus of so significant a terrorism inquiry is a symptom of the larger problems of islam in britain and of
2259388 the force that drives mosque congregants and their children to build bombs in britain does not originate in social conditions experienced by muslims in europe rather it represents a doctrine brought from the arab world via pakistan and well funded groups like lashkar e taiba to communities from birmingham england to fairfax virginia
2259389 this war is a bit like the developing solution used in the old darkrooms at first the image is blurry pale and blurry and then the shadows contours tints and half tints and contrasts gradually emerge and the latent image that was seen without being seen is suddenly revealed and fixed thats what is happening at this moment whether regarding the nature of hezbollah the state of moral and political corruption of a largely hezbollized lebanon iran and its geopolitical game and nuclear ambitions or the slipping of moderate islam toward fundamentalist islam and within this at the heart of this sectarian international in the making the slipping of the arab zone of islam toward the asian or indo european zone where iran aspires to be the hegemonic power this war functions as a magnifier and revealer at least i hope so
2259390 the more we had repression executions as the revolution started swallowing its own children i started to see this unbelievable reality and from the other side i started to read about revolutions throughout history and i ended up seeing one pattern that all revolutions are the same they follow the same rules i realized that repression is in the essence of revolution and i realized that we cannot produce democracy with revolution
2259391 a comprehensive peace settlement would not only defang the radicals in lebanon and palestine and their supporters in other countries it would also reduce the influence of iran the country that under its current ideology poses the greatest potential threat to stability in saudi arabia iraq egypt and jordan

2259503 the real estate bust is creating an unexpected benefit housing for the homeless even as the foreclosure crisis pushes some low income families into shelters chronic homeless rates are shrinking thanks in part to the foreclosed and vacant buildings social service agencies can now afford to buy in denver persistent homelessness is down 36 percent since 2005 as nonprofits have turned seized apartment buildings and run down motels into 1 242 rooms complete with access to addiction treatment and health care a wooster mass nonprofit will soon close on five multifamily duplexes that will provide 20 to 30 units for the homeless and ventura county calif is in talks with local banks to take over 100 homes for permanent use

2259509 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state

2259513 yeah and i like shot but i disagree on the democratic split thing see i know mctygue purposely drove a wedge between the party hoping to keep control of it

2259532 answering a question about his approach to combating crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism

2259574 on behalf of russias muslim community we are calling on georgias politicians and statesmen to halt military attacks against women the elderly and children and immediately stop bloodshed and violence which may leave an infamous page in georgian history and lead to a humanitarian catastrophe
2259575 the georgian and ossetian peoples have century long ties of friendship and kinship
2259576 however difficult and complex they may be contentious issues should be resolved at the negotiating table on the basis of international law from the point of view of the interests of peoples who have lived side by sides for centuries and have a century long history of peaceful neighbourhood
2259577 considering europes virtual silence and the un security councils reluctance to condemn the developments in south ossetia we can speak about double standards we are being constantly reminded of god knows what while a blind eye is being turned to obvious acts of aggression genocide and violation of international law
2259578 if in the near future nato member countries and the whole military political bloc fail to condemn this aggression and take vigorous measures to halt the hostilities the organizations real goals and aggressive nature will leave no one in doubt
2259579 we are a strong power hysterics cries and hand wringing is the lot of the weak
2259580 our countrys international reputation is at stake today russias actions today will determine attitude to it in the world
2259581 will have to stop talking and to act and carry out its treaty obligations
2259582 russia must demand that hostilities be stopped immediately and show its force without using it for the time being
2259583 the saakashvili regime pins hopes on support from its western friends it is using foreign weapons to kill civilians including citizens of the russian federation who live in south ossetia but saakashvili must remember that the south ossetian people has not been abandoned great russia is behind it
2259584 the most stupid thing that can be done in this situation is a military response by russia like bringing in troops because such an escalation of the conflict will result in casualties and this must not happen
2259585 russia should use its status of member of the council of europe and international organizations to resolve the problem that has come about between itself georgia and south ossetia by diplomatic means
2259586 will aggravate relations between our countries between russia and the eu and russia and nato
2259587 this war may have catastrophic consequences for the entire caucasus region thus for russia itself too
2259588 cis countries should become a guarantor of the implementation of this agreement we are calling on the nato leadership to take off the agenda the issue of georgias accession to this organization and postpone it for the future
2259589 moreover the current situation calls for intervention by representatives of other states including russia as well as international organization
2259590 today the day olympic games opened in beijing georgia has in fact declared war on south ossetia
2259591 this is a blatant violation not only of their own pledges but most importantly of internaitonal law and ethics
2259592 the un should act tough first of all it should demand that hostilities in the region be halted immediately and talks between tskhinvali and tbilisi be organized
2259593 had not felt support in the west particularly in the usa
2259594 i dont understand how you feel justified in pursuing your self serving interest in selling a lot of books right now when you just turned your back on efforts to reach some sort of energy solution on the house floor last week was it really necessary for you to turn off the lights and the microphones on the house floor when you left the debate behind you so you could take your vacation what is it going to take for you to listen to the majority of the american public and allow their elected representatives to vote on energy measures that include but are not limited to drilling in the u s

2259597 the town council will consider approval of a proposed 67percent increase in monthly wastewater bills at this tuesdays monthly meeting which convenes at 5pm at town hall more accurately the council will ratify the increase which is required by the colorado water resources and power development authority cwrpda the cwrpda has made the increase a requirement for the 2 million loan it has offered the town for the construction of a new wastewater facility on the site of the towns aging treatment lagoons the terms offered are attractive 20 years at a rate of 1 857 percent the price tag for the new waste treatment facility became less attractive this month in june sanitation department head phil starks warned the council if the wastewater treatment plant does come in much higher then the debt service will be much higher then the rates will be much higher the treatment plant came in 1 million higher two weeks ago preliminary estimates from project engineers were hiked from 4 3 million to 5 3 million two weeks ago and this 5 3 million estimate is very tentative the new wastewater plant in bayfield similar in design to the pagosa plant but only two thirds the size began construction last week and is now expected to cost 7 1 million

2259606 the signing furthers the historic energy cooperation commitment between the us and sweden as we work together to advance the research development and deployment of plug in hybrid vehicles from the lab to the marketplace
2259607 the advancement of clean energy technologies such as plug in hybrid vehicles will help address the serious challenge of global climate change while enhancing our countries economic growth and increased energy security
2259608 we have been delighted to see how quickly we have grown a quality operation in sweden
2259609 this has been fueled in part by the very close collaboration with our sister firms mccann and lowe and we see that continuing under the new brand structure and alignment
2259610 much more secure future growth for the port of oskarshamn
2259611 generally it is the case that the higher your freight volumes the more freight you can attract
2259612 registrations of low emission cars increased by 89 per cent during the first half of 2008 and set new records both when looking at the number sold and the share of low emission cars of the entire amount of car registrations
2259613 the success of low emission cars in sweden is unique in an international perspective and the environmental adjustment of motoring in sweden is moving rapidly thanks to a larger share of both low emission cars and diesel cars that emit low amounts of carbon dioxide
2259614 it is interesting to point out that during the month of june 62 per cent of new cars were fuelled by something else than petrol eg diesel e85 gas or electric hybrids just three years ago in 2005 only 15 per cent of new cars were driven on fuels other than petrol its a dramatic changeover that we are witnessing on the swedish car market which also means that carbon dioxide emissions from new cars is recreasing rapidly
2259615 one of the goals of stockholms environmental programme is that sales of low emission cars should represent 35 per cent of total sales of new cars by 2011 it is satisfying that statistics are showing that we are already exceeding that goal with a share of 41 per cent during january to may of this year
2259616 stockholm is reinforcing its position as the city with the most low emission cars in europe
2259617 the statistics illustrate the environmental commitment of the people of stockholm focusing on the actual emissions of cars is the best way of combining our environmental responsibilities with peoples need for transport technological neutrality is important to not impede technological developments by favouring one technology over another
2259618 actress teams up with indie rocker to pursue music career
2259619 i congratulate congress for its hard work in concluding the reauthorization of the higher education act which seeks to tackle many complex and challenging issues that are vexing to students and their families as well as to institutions the administration supports many of the bills provisions which are designed to enact needed reforms and address the problems facing colleges students and families in the 21st century however we remain concerned with the creation of more than 60 new costly and duplicative programs higher education has been a priority for this administration in 2005 my bipartisan commission on the future of u s higher education launched a robust national dialogue on the need to strengthen higher education to remain competitive in todays knowledge based global economy one year later the spellings commission issued a comprehensive report that among other things cited specific recommendations to make higher education more accessible more affordable and more accountable while the legislation takes some positive steps forward it fails to create the necessary reforms in accessibility and affordability and it falls short on strengthening accountability more work can and must be done to make achievement outcomes more transparent to students and families for the sake of students who are committed to achieving their dreams through the pursuit of higher education we must remain vigilant in advancing policies that support their goals this bill represents another important step but we still have a long way to go

2259627 looking at the your mocks it appears as though you would want to fetch lots of information from the server during the course of interaction with the user and to update both the form on the left and the results on the right interactively i think gwt would be an excellent way to do this

2259648 the bureau of land management has revised a proposal to trade land for water rights by adding four saguache county parcels totaling 1 476 acres the new parcels will be appraised along with six from rio grande county for their value in a swap that would give the federal agency an annual right to 189 acre feet of surface water to mitigate groundwater pumping on the blanca wetlands the land would go to the sun peaks land company which currently controls surface water on the anderson ditch near monte vista

2259653 it is frankly outrageous that the state is withholding these documents i am certain their reasons for doing so will be connected to a long suspected dirty tricks campaign which was waged against the party by british unionists who were frankly in a panic about the rise of the snp
2259654 one asks what the government has to hide in withholding the files
2259655 rumours about agent provocateurs within nationalist ranks in the 1970s haveraged for decades
2259656 the snp appears totally paranoid all the evidence shows they are absolutely no threat whatever to the british state
2259657 a spokeswoman for the national archives said she could not discuss why specific files had been closed but added that documents were generally withheld because they contain sensitive information about national security or because they contained individuals personal details

2259665 our company is focused on empowering individuals with an innovative opportunity that allows them to own their own online travel website and earn commissions every time someone simply books travel there
2259666 typically people book either their personal travel or company travel from an anonymous website that does not pay them a commission we are showing people a way to purchase the same airline tickets hotel rooms cruises and other travel related purchases at a comparable price
2259667 travel already the largest industry in the world at over 7 trillion book annually and with baby boomers now retiring at the rate of 1 every 8 seconds for the next several years we are positioned to experience phenomenal growth in this business
2259668 we want to extend this exciting opportunity to others looking to start their own home business so they can not only save on their own travel and earn commissions on the travel booked by their friends and family but take advantage of the numerous tax benefits that come with owning a home business in a struggling economy it is important for individuals and families to seek out other forms of income and get the tax breaks this business can provide
2259669 the difference between our program and our competition is that we pay people to use our service think about it if you give someone a choice between two companies that have the same phones the same prices on plans the same quality service and company a is going to pay you every month and company b will not which do you think people will choose

2259675 you are under arrest me what for thats what they all say
2259676 s hould someone ask me whether i would indicate the west such as it is today as a model to my country frankly i would have to answer negatively
2259677 a fact which cannot be disputed is the weakening of human beings in the west while in the east they are becoming firmer and stronger
2259678 this means that the mistake must be at the root at the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
2259679 the turn introduced by the renaissance evidently was inevitable historically
2259680 however in early democracies as in american democracy at the time of its birth all individual human rights were granted because man is gods creature
2259681 all this is visible to observers from all the worlds of our planet the western way of life is less and less likely to become the leading model
2259682 there are meaningful warnings that history gives a threatened or perishing society such are for instance the decadence of art or a lack of great statesmen
2259683 there is a disaster however which has already been under way for quite some time i am referring to the calamity of a despiritualized and irreligious humanistic consciousness
2259684 if humanism were right in declaring that man is born to be happy he would not be born to die since his body is doomed to die
2259685 it would be retrogression to attach oneself today to the ossified formulas of the enlightenment social dogmatism leaves us completely helpless in front of the trials of our times
2259686 even if we are spared destruction by war our lives will have to change if we want to save life from self destruction
2259687 if the world has not come to its end it has approached a major turn in history equal in importance to the turn from the middle ages to the renaissance
2259688 this ascension will be similar to climbing onto the next anthropologic stage
2259689 more than 1 4 million americans have signed a petition demanding that congress pass legislation to lower gas prices and increase production of american made energy

2259883 t he first thing that happened which i still think is strange to me the lights went out i had heard right before the lights went out i had heard a distant boom boom boom sounded like three explosions at the time i would have said they sounded like bombs but it was boom boom boom and then the lights all go out i would say about 3 4 seconds all of a sudden this tremendous roar
2259884 no corroborating evidence for alternative hypotheses suggesting that the wtc towers were brought down by controlled demolition using explosives
2259885 w e heard an explosion we looked up and the building was coming down right on top of us
2259886 i heard a ground level explosion and im like holy shit and then you heard that twisting metal wreckage again
2259887 a large explosion took place in my estimation that was the tower coming down but at that time i did not know what that was i thought some type of bomb had gone off and saw like three floors explode saw the antenna coming down
2259888 i remember seeing the antenna do a little rock back and forth and i could just hear the floors pancaking i heard it for about 30 pancakes just boom boom boom boom
2259889 thats when the second collapse started to come down all kinds of noise boom boom boom boom boom very loud
2259890 when eyewitnesses claim to have heard explosions prior to the collapse those were just the sounds of a massive building contorting and crushing anything inside
2259891 if the war on terror and freedom is only half as successful as the war on drugs we will be that much closer to heaven
2259892 i believe that a lone man using a single rifle having been trained as a marine by the united states and having attained sharp shooter status assassinated jfk
2259893 one of the two people in their second year on the executive committee would be the paper chair and the other would be the program chair and they then run against each other for vice head
2259894 we prepared an extensive three day training program to inform our partners of the new developments in all aspects of our product lines we have many exciting new products like the clarity pacs as well as new image processing software and improvements to our current line of cr systems we are excited to have shared our news with our partners and hope this meeting provided them the tools to expand the icrco name further in these ever emerging markets
2259895 when mesothelioma happened to a close family member we did not know where to begin amp we are the largest private consumer group in the us so we have created a safety net for us mesothelioma victims and their families or loved ones there is nothing even close to the free services we offer mesothelioma victims or their loved ones in the world
2259896 we have spent two years identifying the best mesothelioma law firms how to get mesothelioma victims va or social security disability where the best treatment centers are etc we created the mesothelioma victims center to be the absolute best resource in the world when it comes to us mesothelioma victims
2259897 we created the mesothelioma victims center so mesothelioma victims or their families would not have to go through what we went through truth be known there are only about a dozen mesothelioma law firms in the us that can produce the best results we have created a system that allows us to not only find the best possible law firms to help get the best va assistance for us navy veterans or veterans of the us armed forces or social security disability assistance
2259898 i was living in new orleans before during and after hurricane katrina and i volunteered at a hospital in a downtown new orleans hospital during and after the storm when we found out mesothelioma had touched my family in 2006 it felt like being right back in katrina we were on our own and there was no safety net for the victim or for our family so i swore this would never happen to another us citizen again as long as i was alive we know the internet is loaded with mesothelioma this or mesothelioma that but there is nothing like the mesothelioma victims center in the us for mesothelioma victims or their families loved ones and our service is free
2259899 our concern in commissioning this survey was to assess the extent to which health professionals are drawn to non conventional forms of medical treatment either for themselves or their patients
2259900 as eastern and western medical approaches become more blended in the healthcare field important decisions must be made as to what treatments are acceptable according to customary medical standards of care and also covered by medical insurers
2259901 to what extent do you use cam approaches in your own medical practice
2259902 from your perspective do physicians tend to draw a line between cam procedures that are acceptable versus non acceptable to western trained clinicians
2259903 i draw the line on anything that isnt proven scientifically unacceptable are those treatments that only target the practices bottom line
2259904 yes only those that have stood up to the test of controlled studies are accepted
2259905 no it seems to me to be driven almost entirely by personal preferences exposure
2259906 doctors are not properly trained in the use of alternative medicine and therefore are very reluctant to use them in their practice
2259907 i believe that most physicians are fixed in their mind set about scientific medicine and alternative medicine
2259908 probably not from my experience physicians who discount cam tend to lump all cam modalities together regardless of their actual credibility or lack thereof and toss out proven methods such as acupuncture regardless of the results
2259909 i see trends in this regard due to more publicity and public demand another reason is being able to incorporate and add cash unrelated to insurance revenue into the practice also patients actually get better
2259910 current trends reveal increasing numbers of procedures are being performed in interventional radiology departments cathlabs hospitals and clinics which have significantly elevated demand for vetted coding expertise in the interventional radiology and cardiovascular subspecialties
2259911 until now there has been no proficiency standard for this subspecialty now with our new nationally recognized circc certification physicians and facilities can have confidence that individuals earning this certification have the proper training and proven expertise to help ensure coding accuracy reduce denial rates increase charge captures and remain compliant for this subspecialty

2259922 the people in the military industrial commission were liars they lied to you and they lied to saddam they were always saying that they were producing or procuring special weapons so that they could get favors out of saddam money cars everything but they were liars if they did all of this business and brought in all of these secret weapons why didnt the weapons work
2259923 saddam had an idea about iraqs conventional and potential unconventional capabilities but never an accurate one because of the extensive lying occurring in that area many reports were falsified the ministers attempted to convey a positive perspective with reports which were forwarded to saddams secretary who in turn passed them up to saddam
2259924 this powerfully concentrated the attention of the other ministers who were unanimous in their insistence that saddam remain in power
2259925 the republican guard chief of staff called all the commanders to meet at the republican guard command center
2259926 the republican guard chief of staff briefed us in front of a large wall map that covered just the central portion of iraq
2259927 when the americans arrived at the first ring on the order from saddam the forces would conduct a simultaneous withdrawal the units would then repeat this procedure until reaching the red circle once in the red circle the remaining units would fight to the death
2259928 with this incredible simplicity and stupidity the assembled republican guard officers were told that this was the plan for the defense of our country qusay said that the plan was already approved by saddam and it was you who would now make it work i disagreed and told qusay that a proud army with an 82 year history cannot fight like this we were not using our experience i was told by qusay that there would be no changes because saddam had signed the plan already

2259934 i firmly believe that the first step of any success is having the thought or idea that you want something better you then need to find a respectable organization or company to help you on your journey and to insure your success do your best of find a personal mentor or coach to provide you the assistance and help you will surely need to succeed yes you can do it on your own but why would you want to go through that much trouble if you didnt have to
2259935 any great success has only been achieved with the help of others so do your homework and contact those who you may work with and find out if they will be a fit for you and your personality
2259936 imagine a world in which every single person is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge thats what were doing
2259937 i think it is an important step that the gravity of the situation has been recognized and that there are some steps in place to turn the tide in afghanistan
2259938 whether that is successful or not is of course an open question
2259939 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
2259940 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
2259941 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaida in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
2259942 at this point al qaidas leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing

2259955 nma is delighted to once again partner with the aop on this extremely important event
2259956 in nearly every category measured ad effectiveness scores on branded content sites were numerically higher than on the web in general on portals or on ad networks
2259957 nearly all forms of online media have an important role to play throughout the purchase funnel
2259958 but branded content sites have a notably greater impact at the points where consumers are establishing brand preference and making purchase decisions
2259959 branded content sites are doing a particularly effective job of delivering results with developing advertising formats including video advertising and rich media
2259960 just as we have seen with offline media the value of context cannot be underestimated a point that is clearly reaffirmed in this study a sponsorship on a name site delivers the power of that media brand to the advertiser associated with that content
2259961 there is a definite undercurrent towards digital driven by 15 to 24 year olds but filtering through to other age groups people seem to be consuming more media generally
2259962 our ongoing relationship with the aop is important to us and we are especially pleased to be supporting the online publishing awards this year with its introduction of mobile research and sales teams categories
2259963 its crucial that such an event both reflects and rewards the diversity and development of the uk online publishing sector and after the success of the aops video and community categories last year i am delighted to see the awards expand again
2259964 the sector has changed tremendously since 2005 with the growth of broadband access and the rise of social networking and its important to acknowledge the businesses and publishers who are leading that change
2259965 it can be argued that the expansion of available suffixes is the equivalent of opening a can of worms in terms of online infringement and cybersquatting
2259966 higher yields will come but dont focus on this from the start

2259979 some say love it is a river that drowns the tender reed some say love it is a razer that leaves your soul to blead some say love it is a hunger an endless aching need i say love it is a flower and you its only seed its the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance its the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance its the one who wont be taken who cannot seem to give and the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live when the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long and you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows lies the seed that with the suns love in the spring becomes the rose
2259980 perhaps some day the sun will shine again and i shall see that still the skies are blue and feel once more i do not live in vain although bereft of you perhaps the golden meadows at my feet will make the sunny hours of spring seem gay and i shall find the white may blossoms sweet though you have passed away perhaps the summer woods will shimmer bright and crimson roses once again be fair and autumn harvest fields a rich delight although you are not there but though kind time may many joys renew there is one greatest joy i shall not know again because my heart for loss of you was broken long ago

2259995 creative destruction is our middle name both within our own society and abroad we tear down the old order every day from business to science literature art architecture and cinema to politics and the law our enemies have always hated this whirlwind of energy and creativity which menaces their traditions whatever they may be and shames them for their inability to keep pace seeing america undo traditional societies they fear us for they do not wish to be undone they cannot feel secure so long as we are there for our very existence our existence not our politics threatens their legitimacy they must attack us in order to survive just as we must destroy them to advance our historic mission
