3830002 we believe player traffic and usage levels dropped by 50 percent or more during august 8 the opening day ceremony while player traffic and usage has picked up since it still remains below pre olympic levels according to our checks

3830005 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with apple and provides even greater differentiation from peers
3830006 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3830007 we however note apple products typically carry low margins and strong initial sales could negatively impact best buys gross margin
3830008 while this does strengthen an important relationship with apple we remain cautious on consumer electronics heading into 2009 as slowing flat panel cycle pressured by falling price points mass competition and weaker consumer discretionary spending is likely to pressure specialty players

3830013 the tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to those immigrants
3830014 the eu cannot accept such developments in neighboring countries and it must not look on without doing something it must make a clear statement addressed to russia and in a second step it must think about what contribution the eu could make towards securing the peacefire in georgia its doubtful whether the eu will be able to reach a consensus on this but if the required unified action were again to fall victim to the strategic interests of individual eu members that would be a further victory for moscow
3830015 the west would be well advised to get used to the idea that moscow no longer shies away from military action in pursuing its interests that forces the eu to define its foreign policy lines more clearly should a country like georgia that is of strategic importance to the west as a transit country for oil and gas be left to russia the eu will have to tackle these uncomfortable questions and even more uncomfortable answers if it ever wants to be more than a superfluous mediator in the step by step restoration of the russian empire
3830016 the battle for a wretched mountain region in the caucasus has created a new world order after deluding itself for too long the west now rapidly needs to find a convincing stance for dealing with a resurgent russia that no longer just rattles its sabre but makes use of it as well
3830017 the west must find a clear language for addressing moscow after hesitating for days george w bush found strong words and branded the russian attack on a sovereign neighboring state as unacceptable in the 21st century but the admonition of the outgoing american president wont have much impact in moscow firstly the russian leadership doesnt see itself as morally accountable to the iraq warrior bush secondly its waiting to see who will be moving into the white house republican hawk john mccain who wants to throw russia out of the g8 group of leading industrial nations or the young democrat barack obama who has made more moderate noises
3830018 theres a big risk that unclear signals may be misunderstood by moscow in this situation

3830045 it has been a rare bright spot for both of them
3830046 multifamily started off as a bit player with us but in recent years it has taken on more importance
3830047 one reason that multifamily stocks have done better than other sectors is that they have a capital raising advantage
3830048 we figured if thats what it took to compete we were going to let them go
3830049 we have a different business model in our multifamily business than we do on single family homes

3830063 a groundbreaking study has found that more than one in every six women who have ever been pregnant in auckland have had an abortion the abortion rate rises to one in every three among women of asian ethnicity and is also above average for younger women and for women who have suffered domestic violence the rate is lower for rural women in the waikato where only one in nine has had an abortion the figures have been published in two new papers stemming from a survey of about 1400 women aged 18 to 64 in auckland and a similar number in rural waikato in 2002 which was focused on finding the rates of domestic violence and associated factors the new papers show not surprisingly that domestic violence is associated with higher rates of both intentional abortions and accidental miscarriages as well as with higher rates of drinking smoking and unwanted pregnancies

3830109 they should not be selling it away by purchasing a portfolio of companies that have very little in the way of strategic tactical or operational value except in a press release with some smoke mirrors and wastes shareholders money in an attempt to make the company look desirable

3830124 our people continue to face a profound humanitarian crisis this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
3830125 tragically zimbabwe has become one of the worst man made humanitarian disasters of a new and hopeful century
3830126 because of the failed policies of zanu pf 5 million zimbabweans now face starvation and famine we cannot allow this to happen
3830127 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country

3830131 the bus collided with the van and in turn moved off the road and hit a guard rail
3830132 he acted very quickly to try and do what he could to manage the situation
3830133 it was a heavy collision the bus was travelling at some speed and the van veered in front of it and was simply collected by the bus
3830134 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out on to the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured

3830142 although the agency does not have service to older adults in florida as its primary focus the exemplary efforts of wpbhas elder care amp crisis manager assisted by one elderly services coordinator and one volunteer personify a record of excellence in work on behalf of senior floridians these are individuals who rise above their daily duties with a passion and creativity to unselfishly serve the needs of a vital part of the community its senior population
3830143 as the slow down in demand for our electrical construction services and the depression in the florida real estate market continue we have been aggressively pursuing expanding the geographic footprint of our electrical construction business outside of our historical operating region as previously announced we have been awarded projects in central colorado and northern texas and although we are still in the initial phase of this expansion i am encouraged by our success and look forward to these new projects making a positive contribution to our results in the coming quarters
3830144 with respect to our real estate development operations notwithstanding the current depression in the florida real estate market i believe that our exposure is very manageable as we do not currently have any projects under construction and our latest project pineapple house is complete and has been well received
3830145 por ser um produto de consumo obrigat rio especialmente entre as crian as o leite um dos itens com maior peso individual no or amento das fam lias
3830146 por isso a queda de pre os ainda que pequena motivo de comemora o ela alivia o bolso do consumidor e tamb m ajuda a diminuir o ritmo da infla o geral
3830147 era um cen rio muito diferente do atual naquela poca o consumo do produto estava crescendo tanto no mercado interno como externo
3830148 como em 2008 a infla o atingiu alimentos essenciais e encareceu a compra de supermercado muitas pessoas diminu ram o consumo de leite para equilibrar a conta
3830149 as empresas iniciaram uma disputa de pre os e os supermercados tamb m reagiram levando um produto mais barato ao consumidor final
3830150 n s n o podemos dar f rias para as vacas e reduzir nosso custo de produ o
3830151 portanto a nica sa da diminuir as margens de lucro e evitar que o leite encalhe em nossas m os
3830152 como em setembro se inicia o per odo de chuvas a produ o deve aumentar e o pre o conseq entemente vai cair mais
3830153 ao lado do p o do trigo e dos leos o leite deve ser um dos alimentos que mais ir o colaborar para que a infla o seja reduzida at o fim do ano
3830154 e n o d para comprar menos porque leite essencial n
3830155 mas se cair mais poderemos voltar a comprar a marca que compr vamos antes da infla o
3830156 com a colabora o dos senhores poderemos assegurar que esse rio corra no seu leito e n o se desvie para outros fins
3830157 se o projeto n o aparece ficamos com meia parceria

3830164 while sales certainly have picked up across illinois during the early spring and summer months some buyers and sellers seem to be waiting for the all clear signal to make a move in this market as economic and consumer confidence indicators remain weak
3830165 our illinois housing market has been resilient given these pressures with prices registering modest losses and many regions still posting gains since sales peaked during the boom in the third quarter of 2005 it is a good market especially for buyers who now have many choices the new first time buyer tax credit and foreclosure rescue program enacted by the housing and economic recovery act should help stabilize the housing market
3830166 while the median home price for a home in the city of chicago is up over 5 percent second quarter data continues to show that the marketplace is stabilizing with the average sales closing at 95 percent of list price chicagos homebuyers are making reasonable offers and finding great deals in the city
3830167 research shows that just one sale of a residential home in illinois results in 28 413 in direct expenditures to other industries such as purchases of new furniture and appliances repair costs and moving expenses the housing markets impact on the states economy underscores why realtors r urge state and local government leaders to keep jobs in illinois and foster a healthy economy
3830168 after posting some impressive gains in the first quarter in contrast to the u s economy the illinois economy has stumbled in the last quarter and recorded the third negative job change in 2008 in june in the last twelve months illinois has outperformed the u s in terms of growth rates but has added only 8 000 jobs in 2007 illinois added almost 42 000 jobs
3830169 still the illinois economy has recorded positive gains in the last twelve months while the rest of the midwest missouri iowa wisconsin indiana ohio and michigan have lost almost 80 000 jobs most of the losses have been recorded in michigan and ohio

3830207 but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we go
3830208 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives
3830209 theres no one who can improve on mourinhos record really it would have to go beyond mourinhos performance to really worry us and that will be a challenge with the players theyve got and the players theyve added
3830210 i believe we were very unlucky last season we lost the premier league by four points
3830211 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
3830212 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
3830213 we started really well and finished really well last season if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season
3830214 it is likely darius will not be available for something like 10 weeks
3830215 he underwent medical tests today and has already begun a course of physiotherapy ahead of another check up next week
3830216 there has been cost overruns in a number of stadiums currently built around the country but all will be ready in time for the
3830217 hosting a big event is not a new thing for south africa
3830218 we have successfully staged the cricket and rugby world cup with no problems we need to up our ante in terms of preparedness to handle the scale of the event
3830219 id rather they didnt but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
3830220 if the left succeeds in gaining and retaining more power the well being of future generations will be at greater peril i fear our children will inherit a nation that is less free and less secure than the nation we inherited from the last generation it is therefore our job to stop them not just debate them but defeat them

3830240 while weve been favoring a dollar rebound in our view this has come a little bit too far too fast there are still significant headwinds for the u s economy and therefore some headwinds for the dollar
3830241 theres been a sell off in the yen crosses it has weighed on the euro and its certainly weighed on sterling
3830242 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3830243 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3830244 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
3830245 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
3830246 im absolutely sure there are more mass graves hidden here
3830247 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3830248 i dont know how political it was i had a high profile case
3830249 i went through all the training i served honorably in my unit i used army provisions to try become a noncombatant and remain in the army as a medic or something but i still would be subject to going on combat missions as a medic

3830252 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption
3830253 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington

3830304 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3830305 we were really looking for blogs that know their state well
3830306 it helps us have a larger audience and a very specific audience in a lot of cases
3830307 i was on a conference call earlier with a bunch of the other bloggers that are coming
3830308 many of them expressed that they dont know what they will be doing i dont know what im going to do and were just going to see what happens and try to find out and cover whats going on
3830309 in terms of how news is reported and how much its dominated by television coverage the political convention does seem like a show
3830310 i think theres going to be so many other meetings happening networking happening things that arent even happening in the pepsi center
3830311 i feel just fine with writing with a biased or partisan point of view
3830312 if you look at what i write about and how i write about it i think i have a very good track record of telling it the way it is
3830313 i highly disagree with the term cheerleader there have been plenty of times when i have called out democrats for decisions ive disagreed with
3830314 in 2004 we only had 12 so were excited to welcome more than 200 this year
3830315 our goal was to interface with as many americans as possible
3830316 its part of a long term strategy of helping deal with local issues and helping good candidates get elected in colorado
3830317 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3830318 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3830319 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3830320 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3830321 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally

3830323 these engagements have taken place both at an individual company level and at industry level
3830324 but it happens to have made a lot of money over the past year
3830325 we believe the music is about to end for this strategy
3830326 the conditions of the market surrounding this company are starting to deteriorate

3830332 the financial services authority has today fined the uk operations of credit suisse for breaching fsa principles 2 and 3 by failing to conduct their business with due skill care and diligence and failing to organise and control their business effectively
3830333 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
3830334 the sudden and unexpected announcement of the write down had the potential to undermine market confidence
3830335 they want to come in where theres an opportunity to invest some capital and take an ownership position but leave the operations in the hands of management
3830336 the economics on the expansions could look pretty attractive in terms of the payback and rate of returns
3830337 the problem is usually those big internationals want to operate as well in this case i would be very surprised if harvest gave up operatorship of the refinery
3830338 its actually cheaper to ship it than it is to pipeline it from the refining area down in the gulf of mexico
3830339 there actually is a geographic advantage to where theyre at right now
3830340 having that flexibility helps them when gasoline margins are so weak in north america they can actually ship that away
3830341 in our view financing such a significant expansion could prove to be a major challenge harvest already boasts the most levered balance sheet in the sector and is not likely to retire any debt going forward as the entirety of its cash flow will be required for capital spending and distributions
3830342 economic analyses indicate the projected return on investment and other financial metrics are compelling
3830343 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3830344 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3830345 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3830346 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3830347 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3830348 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3830349 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3830350 un pedazo de lasagna congelada es como un ladrillo de hielo muy pesado
3830351 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3830352 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3830353 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3830354 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3830355 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3830356 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3830357 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions

3830360 ford is playing to win and lead in small cars
3830361 and we are doing so by centralizing our global engineering and vehicle program responsibilities to ensure quality launches and by basing flexible small car assembly facilities in north america to allow for quick response to market dynamics
3830362 we at ford see this years consumer shift to smaller vehicles as an opportunity and one that ford is uniquely positioned to answer using the strength of our european small car lineup and our fast moving global product plan
3830363 we plan to answer the call with dynamic fun to drive small cars and we intend to make them profitably
3830364 though agricultural commodity prices have moderated they remain quite favorable by historical standards and are continuing to provide strong support to farm incomes and to the sale of productive farm machinery worldwide
3830365 with the software youre able to calculate what the expected wind would be at that time and to tell you how much power you should be generating
3830366 in this case i would say it was a million dollars well spent
3830367 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
3830368 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
3830369 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
3830370 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
3830371 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
3830372 to challenge the patterns of over consumption and excess that have created the environmental crisis
3830373 recognizes the inseparability of ecological and social issues and the necessity of ensuring the solution to one problem does not create or worsen another
3830374 the rbc 2010 flag tour gives all canadians a chance to celebrate our countrys recent success at torino while building momentum for vancouver 2010
3830375 it invites canadians to personally connect with the olympic experience in a live and interactive way
3830376 the rbc 2010 flag tour will showcase the power of olympism to bring together canadians from all walks of life from all parts of the country in appreciation of olympic values and our love for winter sport
3830377 i am proud to be part of the first cross canada tour promoting the 2010 games since the truly inspiring performances of our countrys elite winter athletes at the torino 2006 games
3830378 was to use a tripod that was most affordable to the professional photographer or serious amateur you can purchase this adorama for 585 with free shipping
3830379 i only thought it because of you actually say stuff out loud people look at you funny ball head did not change how light it felt not only was it light it was compact when i laid the case next to my old tripod it was about half the size
3830380 my inspiration is nature like kyoto like a beautiful river this time in these paintings i used blue a lot this year i like blue its like glow in the dark like you can see at night time
3830381 the bones are the old buildings and trains the areas around the city that are forgotten this is western virginia its an old switching yard where a lot of graffiti artists go out to at night you can always go out there the flowers are the graffiti on the train any light thats brought to this is through the graffiti this is an old area and one of the most exciting things here is to watch a train full of graffiti go past
3830382 i think that any kind of urban landscape that you paint is going to have to show the reality behind it which is quite often the landscapes with graffiti on them in a way for me beyond guilianis broken window thing graffiti is a tell tale sign that maybe something needs to be done to this area maybe we need to take these buildings and reuse them instead of tearing them down maybe we need to take a look at this area and see if we need to revitalize it in a different way or maybe we need to think about whats going on with the people actually painting these walls graffiti is way more than a kid putting his name up on the wall its a sign of where arts going when you see a whitney biennial and some of these artists started tagging trains and tagging walls and now theyre huge its exciting its tearing the art world down in a fantastic way
3830383 this is a portrait of dalai lama i did because i was in katmandhu 2 months ago and i met a lot of tibetan people and they were very nice and i wanted to remember them i do a series like this with a lot of bad men this is the first time i do a good guy i did the dalai lama because the rubik cubes are coming from china its a kind of reconciliation with china and the dalai lama
3830384 i knew for awhile i wanted to work with rubik cubes i went to a flea market and i saw them and i always bought them i did my first sculpture with 9 rubik cubes i thought it was perfect because of the pixel effect its a game like the space invader and its an object from my generation something from my culture from my memory its colorful and for me a very logical subject to use in my work
3830385 after doing space invaders and using tile its just a natural evolution the name for all of this work is rubik cubism because im doing some rubik cubist pieces picasso did cubism and i am doing rubik cubism that means a new kind of art movement
3830386 i fear that the head of state would like the european officials to tolerate the poor state state of justice in romania and the blocking of the fight with the great corruption

3830403 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3830404 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3830405 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3830406 sql anywhere for blackberry sets new standards for data reliability and performance of mobile line of business applications
3830407 developers and enterprises alike can unwire their enterprise by building on their existing investment in the blackberry platform enabling mission critical data to flow seamlessly and reliably from the data center to their frontline decision makers
3830408 applications being deployed on mobile devices are becoming increasingly complex as the capabilities and resources of the devices increase often approaching pc functionality
3830409 however the complexity of these applications often exceeds the data capabilities included in the native device os a robust secure and easily synchronized data base such as sybase sql anywhere is required to enable the same level of data integrity and manipulation as available on pcs and servers

3830411 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3830412 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3830413 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3830414 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3830419 whether its enhancing producer knowledge and training for dairy professionals or capturing value from agricultural waste and by products if its a priority for industry its a priority for the foundation industry groups come to us with their project ideas in these areas and we then provide the necessary investment to enable them to make it happen
3830420 we are not prepared right now to face the opportunities the arctic offers us nor are we properly aware of the threats that lie just over the horizon of climate change and the need to adapt to it throughout the circumpolar north
3830421 weve nevertheless eliminated the position of canadian circumpolar ambassador and allowed the northern dimension of canadian foreign policy component to wither away despite our sometimes vocal attachment as canadians to the north these negative developments of our own making have been met with hardly a murmur of concern
3830422 weve got to get serious about circumpolar politics and act now in concert with the other ice states and indigenous peoples for collective stewardship in the evolution of the arctic as region in its own right
3830423 we are honored to have someone of pattis experience join our board

3830426 spacedev is playing a key role in the development of the commercial utilization of space and i am honored to be able to contribute to that mission by being a part of the spacedev team

3830437 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3830438 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3830439 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance

3830465 revenant is a superhero book filtered through the lens of slasher horror
3830466 its a story of revenge told from the perspective of a band of gangsters who have risen to power in sapphire city
3830467 at the center is a guy named danny risk his nightclub is a haven for these crime lords to meet and do business but we get a sense that theres more to danny that first appears
3830468 shannon and keith saw the character more as a shadow or spider type
3830469 when i took over i sort of recast the book as a horror story or a splatter story anyway the revenant is a very cruel character he isnt content to simply stop the bad guys he wants to kill them in a horrific manner and taunt them while hes doing it
3830470 im more and more a fan of the graphic novel format mainly because i cant remember the stories i read a month earlier
3830471 the revenant is pretty fast paced and having the entire story under one cover suits it better desperado was agreeable eager even to publish it as such the shift has allowed us to expand the story help it breath and flow a bit better there are 20 additional story pages in the graphic novel that would not have been possible if we were constrained to a miniseries format
3830472 ive also written comics adaptations of three volumes of a very famous kids book series but i cant name that either
3830473 on friday who it is now learned actually lip synched her way into the hearts of millions

3830476 im sorry youll have to wait please get back in line
3830477 those guys just left why cant we go in now
3830478 last year they closed a few of the bars because of overcrowding
3830479 i remember some people said the police were harassing the bars because they were gay
3830480 you know its like this everywhere today just be patient itll open up in a minute or so
3830481 thats bullshit this is discrimination youre not letting us in because were women i wanna speak to the fucking manager
3830482 oh fuck you stupid faggots stupid fucking asshole faggots wont let us in their fucking fag bar well call the fucking police on you my father knows the fucking mayor
3830483 the financial services authority has today fined the uk operations of credit suisse for breaching fsa principles 2 and 3 by failing to conduct their business with due skill care and diligence and failing to organise and control their business effectively
3830484 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
3830485 the sudden and unexpected announcement of the write down had the potential to undermine market confidence
3830486 committed to reaching an agreement that upholds the will of the people
3830487 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3830488 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008
3830489 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3830490 without further delay we are demanding that ngos be allowed to resume humanitarian assistance distributing food medicines and life saving assistance this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
3830491 im shocked that bill gates would allow such a fumble to happen
3830492 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3830493 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3830494 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3830495 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3830496 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3830497 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3830498 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3830499 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3830500 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3830501 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3830502 it allows us to kill all the speculation of the last 18 months and allows us to concentrate on the really important thing next season
3830503 the only thing worse than being alone is being around other people
3830504 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
3830505 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
3830506 the mind once stretched by a new idea never returns to its original dimensions
3830507 most people do not have a clue how many calories they are taking in when they have a milkshake or a double hamburger with cheese and fries
3830508 this is an incentive for people to make the right dietary choices
3830509 actually it seems like life makes sure that the older individuals die for sure through degenerative diseases and brutal forms of aggressive neoplasia and other cancers
3830510 our results suggest that when intimacy ebbs doubts about the relationship emerge
3830511 making emerging adults aware of how romantic associations inevitably pose a threat to a persons subjective well being might help them to form more realistic romantic relationship goals
3830512 i think youll find that this is the real deal

3830520 the entire un system urgently needs reform now more than ever
3830521 reports that un peacekeepers are sexually abusing children are simply unconscionable
3830522 peacekeepers are deployed to prevent war violence and brutality not to facilitate such atrocities allegations of abuse irreparably harm the credibility of the peacekeeping mission
3830523 the un mission in drc has been plagued for years by charges of abuse and corruption yet new allegations continue to surface we must ask how such a culture of impunity can persist the un must fully investigate these charges and make the necessary management reforms to prevent further corruption in the interim the un must ensure that those accused are not deployed on other peacekeeping missions where they might continue to commit crimes against the defenseless and vulnerable
3830524 the severe storms in july and august caused massive destruction in many parts of the state but belknap county has been particularly hard hit first by the tornado and then by heavy rainfall
3830525 this meeting is a good opportunity for me to talk to the local police chiefs about the damage in their communities and the recovery efforts which are now underway this weeks disaster declaration will provide federal funds to help the state and local governments remove debris and repair roads and infrastructure in belknap carroll and rockingham counties however the disaster declaration is open ended and the state can still submit additional information to support its request for assistance to other counties and to individuals who have suffered losses as well as documentation of additional damage caused by last weeks storms i stand ready to work with local state and federal officials in that effort
3830526 i cant make it a perfect world because some people will flaunt the law
3830527 what were trying to do is respond to things that were finding and the thing were finding is people are getting creative so we need to be creative in finding solutions
3830528 were trying desperately to set up it systems that alert us to critical things like addresses phone numbers names that sound similar
3830529 weve been testing it we just havent got it fully implemented yet
3830530 and if this person de la torre was following safety regulations we would not have these people dead today its a travesty and we should allow for people like this to receive the full weight of the law
3830531 i think we need to give this individual a full opportunity to be heard but if hes guilty of what we suspect he needs to feel the weight of the penalty and anybody else who would even think about doing it they need to know were looking over their shoulder
3830532 these parents have undergone tremendous heartache yet they continue to fight tirelessly to improve bus safety standards in texas and across the country

3830542 it means an awful lot its comforting to see people you know everybody from georgia supports everybody else when i do an interview and i just did one with a guy from los angeles i slip in georgia every time
3830543 it was absolutely terrific we were with president bush and the first lady and so many athletes that you see on tv and read about but the main thing was it was just a good feeling you are filled with such elation from head to toe for hours and hours its the greatest feeling the feeling of the olympic games is how the world should be
3830544 whatever it looks like on tv magnify it by about a thousand seeing it on tv or in pictures cant do it justice its remarkable its one heck of a stage its the most remarkable place ive ever seen for swimming

3830550 estamos viendo los antecedentes del caso para tomar todas las medidas cautelares que correspondan para impedir que una persona con este tipo de antecedentes delictuales pueda ingresar a territorio nacional
3830551 this year has not been normal because of the internally displaced persons who took refuge in the province and also due to unfavourable climatic conditions that adversely affected our food crops
3830552 our projection for this year is that we are likely to require nearly double the relief food rations 150 000 bags of maize and 60 000 bags of beans to see us through
3830553 some of these areas have to make do with relief food until the next crop
3830554 indeed there is need for an emop emergency operation assessment to help identify the actual needs on the ground
3830555 the short rains maize crop has been harvested yields were low and expected to drop by 75 per cent bean yields are very low and are expected to drop by over 90 per cent
3830556 currently 60 percent of the farming households are depending on the markets for their food items
3830557 farm input prices especially fertilisers have also risen dramatically in price and with the long rains planting season being over many farmers reduced on the rates or completely avoided their usage and this will greatly hamper food security this year

3830564 if the land issue was not solved immediately we will launch a chalo jammu agitation
3830565 amarnath land belongs to amarnath amp it must be returned to amarnath shrine board also the amarnath yatra which has been hurriedly shifted to j amp k tourism dept to allow kashmiri muslims to loot hindu pilgrims in shraavan must to returned to amarnath shrine board immediately for over 42 days jammu protested peacefully yet the govt is siding jehadis in kashmir like huriyat amp pdp instead of listening to what jammu s demands are the govt sent 8 battalions amp 15 000 army men in jammu who shot in the head directly killing jammu hindus kashmiri muslims who killed amp kicked off 4 00 000 kashmiri hindus from their homes in kashmir now wants to kick off amarnath this is an insult to hindis all india
3830566 those who keep saying that all this is happening in j amp k its about amarnath i dont live there why should i get affected by them or chakka jam all such people must open their eyes quickly to the bitter truth that from the same kashmir border jehadis are pouring in with the help of the same kasmiri jehadis who have snatched not just amarnath land but also lives amp livelihood houses farms of 4 00 000 kashmiri hindus same people are now blasting indian cities from delhi to hyderabad mumbai to gauhati amp bangaluru to ahmedabad kashmiri jehadi huriyat man aziz is killed in police firing when he was on way to pak holding pak flag but fed on indian food that comes from indian tax payers money amp lashkar e toyba head says he would revenge azizs death whose brothers are they india s or paks people in india must realize this now that when jammu protesting they hold bharat tiranga amp kashmiris walk to pak holding pak flags they blast indian cities amp indian govt gives pension to their families from indian tax payers money when common indian is suffering from more than double prices of food milk petrol etc jammu amp amarnath injustice is just a tip of the iceberg amp if india doesnt stand up against such separatist jehadis before its too late then very soon children in india will have their schools blasted by these jehadis the way these kashmiri jehadis killed kashmiri pundits amp wrote on the chests of their mothers amp sisters men you die amp leave your women for us same way they would do all india amarnath land snatch amp yet govt attacking jammu hindus through army is a warning from jehadis therefore all india has time to protest now or never
3830567 about 60 70 pre fab shelters were sent to uri and tangdhar where they housed thousands

3830574 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3830575 it just doesnt seem to me to be very smart in such a time of crisis to decide whether we should revert to the previous situation
3830576 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods
3830577 europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient

3830581 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3830582 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3830583 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time

3831093 god alone will sum up all things in christ things in heaven and things on earth
3831094 the irony is that those american churches that protest most vocally against the teaching of darwinism in their schools are often in their public policies supporting a kind of economic darwinism the survival of the fittest in world markets and military power
3831095 thus when people object as they do to me and other pointing out that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer by commenting that wealth is not finite that statist and globalist solutions and handouts will merely strip the poor of their human dignity and vocation to work and that all this will encourage the poor toward a sinful envy of the rich a slothful escapism and a counterproductive reliance on caesar rather than god i want to take such commentators to refugee camps to villages where children die every day to towns where most adults have already died of aids and show them people who havent got the energy to be envious who arent slothful because they are using all the energy theyve got to wait in line for water and to care for each other who know perfectly well that they dont need handouts so much as justice
3831096 the resurrection of jesus points us to it and gives us the energy for it
3831097 i think weve frankly gone about as far as we can go
3831098 the question continues to be are there republican votes for it
3831099 weve said to the governor what do you need in order to move forward so weve negotiated on that point
3831100 ill guarantee you that there wont be anybody in the house thats going to be happy with the conclusion but it is a compromise new revenues and program cuts and no borrowing
3831101 weve always said that were not doing anything that gives away the legislative responsibility for appropriating money in the budget
3831102 when we go for a vote were going because its a budget that the governor can get some votes for
3831103 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3831104 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3831105 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3831106 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3831107 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3831108 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3831109 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3831112 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives
3831113 this was simply a murderous act against humanitarian workers committed individuals who were there to assist the people of afghanistan
3831114 she was utterly compassionate she was giving she was courageous and she was very very good at her work
3831115 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3831116 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3831117 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3831118 in contact with afghan authorities to confirm reports that two canadian aid workers were killed today
3831119 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3831120 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3831129 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3831130 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3831131 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3831158 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3831159 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3831160 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3831161 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3831172 look i have jesus in my heart i want to bring many others to jesus here is the apostle of divine love jesus give me your light throughout my long way
3831173 see look at these hypocrites who divide and confound the hell out of trying to find the truth about the bible and divine revelation is this what jesus wanted did jesus want people to divide and kill one another who he is and what he meant obviously not therefore you know what i say this whole idea of the inspiration of the bible is bs and for that matter that any divine revelation is bs i mean look at the rcc too they claim to have even more divine revelation and they killed people and the muslims have a different book and they kill even more see all this idea about a god who reveals and redeems is just bs because all it brings is bloodshed and division therefore i tell you this there is no divine revelation or assistance that is a myth contracted by scoundrels and ignorant people yeah i surmise there still must be a god up there some supreme being admittedly for such is evident from creation i mean despite these supernaturally religious hypocrites i can see the beauty of the sky and moutains and rivers and conclude some great being made these things i can admit that and i can admit that there are certain moral principles that are evident from the creation itself that much is clear therefore whereas you can rest assured that divine supernatural activity is bs you can resolve to still accept reason and the natural religion that flows therefrom
3831174 theres no one who can improve on mourinhos record really it would have to go beyond mourinhos performance to really worry us and that will be a challenge with the players theyve got and the players theyve added
3831175 i believe we were very unlucky last season we lost the premier league by four points
3831176 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
3831177 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
3831178 we started really well and finished really well last season if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season

3831195 supramolecular domains in mixed peptide self assembled monolayers on gold nanoparticles
3831196 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
3831197 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
3831198 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology

3831204 while the chairman can stack the deck with a board of directors and executive management team that looks more like a friends and family reunion than anything else should the irs determine that wwes contracted talent are employees and not independent contractors there is the potential for significant fines expenses and cost of doing business on a go forward basis that could have a serious negative impact on wwe stock
3831205 we live in an age where young people are flattered into believing that they can do anything that they want its not true you have to have an aptitude for something a talent for it but ability alone is not
3831206 the consumer is still under enormous pressure as employment is declining real wages are down housing and stock market wealth are down and credit conditions continue to tighten
3831207 this data is consistent with our bearish forecast of personal consumption throughout the second half of 2008
3831208 going forward a tight credit environment a deteriorating labor sector and elevated prices will act as a significant constraint on consumption
3831209 there is potential inflation outside of oil and the credit markets get a little nervous when they believe that food and energy price inflation might spread
3831210 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it

3831216 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3831217 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3831218 the car was clearly marked they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in humanitarian community in afghanistan
3831219 since they oppose the current government they also oppose those who work with it
3831220 and unfortunately they dont differentiate among armed multinational forces security contractors and humanitarian groups
3831221 the irc provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted

3831235 this is something potentially valuable to advertisers as huge traffic spikes are possible from the largest social sites that can lead to an imbalance in their trend data especially for the most recent three month period that appears in their toolbar by default
3831236 now why would alexa do this i think the answer is simple alexa wants to be a tool used by advertisers
3831237 and advertisers know that social media traffic is worth much much much much much much much less than search and repeat visitor traffic
3831238 and those eyeballs have the opportunity to view and click on the graphical advertisements around them

3831306 i cant get into any specifics about the story were telling because were still working on it all but theyre from the 31st century and it will be focusing on some obvious characters who first met clark
3831307 it will be written to fit with smallville and i think its going to be a really fun challenge to approach the legion in a different way but with me you know youre going to see legion rings and theyre going to be as true to the core as possible its going to be the legion of super heroes
3831308 like i said ive known the smallville team for a long time and i have to thank jeph loeb for introducing me to those people in the first place
3831309 im really looking forward to working on the show its exciting to see the legion be part of that

3831363 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
3831364 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
3831365 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
3831366 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
3831367 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
3831368 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
3831369 recruiting is hard its just finding the needles in the haystack
3831370 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
3831371 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence

3831373 even though we are full we are still accepting applications
3831374 we understand that there may still be some students who change their minds and decide not to move in so we want to make any open spots available to others
3831375 we are delighted to welcome our first residents this fall
3831376 these students are trailblazers for the university of michigan flint and will forever change and redefine our identity as a campus

3831378 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
3831379 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
3831380 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
3831381 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
3831382 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
3831383 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
3831384 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes
3831385 when we make love i feel like i could be anyone
3831386 it just reinforces for me the sense that i dont really matter to him
3831387 well we havent been getting along so i try to get close by coming onto you but i guess i dont feel sure enough safe enough to slow down and really get into it so i just go with the sensation in the end i dont really enjoy it that much either
3831388 nebraska beef has a contentious history with the usda over the past six years federal meat inspectors have repeatedly written it up for sanitation violations and the company has fought back from september 2002 to february 2003 usda shut down the plant three times for problems such as feces on carcasses water dripping off pipes onto meat paint peeling onto equipment and plugged up meat wash sinks
3831389 a privately held firm which does not file annual reports with the u s federal securities and exchange commission nebraska beef was founded in 1995 by a group of investors led by company president william hughes in alliance with day lee inc the u s arm of nippon ham of japan
3831390 this is another example of a broken federal system that hasnt put enough resources into stopping the problem
3831391 i am lonelier with him her than when i am by myself
3831392 well what is real love anyway is it two people making out i am not sure i have ever seen it and if you dont even know what it looks like then love is just stumbling around in the dark
3831393 we know what it looks like i can show it to you on a video of one of our therapy sessions we can show you the exact moment when a relationship moves into the light and our research says that if this happens it will stay strong in the years ahead
3831394 okay so no more mr dont give a damn i am going to jump off a cliff here take the leap fact is i need you like i need to pull air into my lungs i want your caring so bad i can hardly stand it i need your arms around me to feel that you are with me it is just so hard to ask

3831477 peter harus menyingkirkan kesombongannya dia juga harus menyingkirkan hasratnya untuk membalas dendam dia belajar bahwa kita semua manusia berdosa dia harus belajar mengampuni
3831478 janganlah kamu kalah terhadap kejahatan tetapi kalahkanlah kejahatan dengan kebaikan
3831479 sebab siapakah yang menganggap engkau begitu penting dan apakah yang engkau punyai yang tidak engkau terima dan jika engkau memang menerimanya mengapakah engkau memegahkan diri seolah olah engkau tidak menerimanya
3831480 kita semua butuh pertolongan orang lain suatu saat peter bahkan spider man sekalipun
3831481 biasanya aku memakai dosa seperti pakaian kini ia menempel di kulitku
3831482 hendaklah kalian waspada dan siap siaga sebab iblis adalah musuhmu ia seperti singa berjalan ke sana kemari sambil mengaum mencari mangsanya
3831483 sungguhpun kejahatan manis rasanya di dalam mulutnya sekalipun ia menyembunyikannya di bawah lidahnya menikmatinya serta tidak melepaskannya dan menahannya pada langit langitnya
3831484 aku berkata kepadamu sesungguhnya setiap orang yang berbuat dosa adalah hamba dosa
3831485 sebab itu hendaklah dosa jangan berkuasa lagi di dalam tubuhmu yang fana supaya kamu jangan lagi menuruti keinginannya
3831486 berperanglah dengan dosamu dan biarkan peperangan itu membuatmu jadi rendah hati dan penuh simpati ketika kamu harus bertarung dengan dosa dosa di dunia ini
3831487 saya kira gak ada alasan untuk kita bergembira atas kematian orang lain pamanmu gak akan mau kamu hidup dengan dendam dalam hatimu walaupun hanya sedetik dendam itu seperti racun ia dapat menguasai kita dan sebelum kita menyadarinya ia sudah membuat kita jadi jahat
3831488 aku orang baik baik aku datang pada mu hari ini dengan rendah hati dan malu untuk memohon pada mu satu hal aku ingin kau bunuh peter parker
3831489 saya diberikan kekuatan yang belum pernah saya impikan seperti turun untukku dari surga
3831490 dan apabila keinginan itu telah dibuahi ia melahirkan dosa dan apabila dosa itu sudah matang ia melahirkan maut
3831491 aku telah menyaksikan bagaimana kegelapan menguasai ayahmu angkara murka yang harus ia bayar dengan nyawanya
3831492 terang itu bercahaya di dalam kegelapan dan kegelapan itu tidak menguasainya
3831493 dan ampunilah seorang akan yang lain apabila yang seorang menaruh dendam terhadap yang lain sama seperti tuhan telah mengampuni kamu kamu perbuat jugalah demikian
3831494 siapa mencari pembalasan dendam ia harus menggali dua lubang kuburan satu untuk musuhnya satu lagi untuk dirinya sendiri
3831495 peter menganggap dirinya tak berdosa dibanding para penjahat makanya kami raimi dan tim ingin membuat peter mengerti bahwa hidup itu tidak hitam putih kita semua adalah manusia dia tidak lebih baik dari orang lain dia harus belajar bahwa diapun gak luput dari dosa dan sebaliknya para penjahat itupun punya rasa kemanusiaan yang harus kita lakukan adalah untuk tidak membalas dendam tapi mengampuni
3831496 jangan menyerah pada angkara eddie dia hanya membuatmu jadi penuh kebencian
3831497 apa yang kita punya di dunia ini adalah kasih sayang dari sahabat dan keluarga kita dan kenyataan bahwa mereka layak untuk mendapatkan pengampunan kita
3831498 tidak ada kasih yang lebih besar dari pada kasih seorang yang memberikan nyawanya untuk sahabat sahabatnya

3831502 supaya kamu tiada beraib dan tiada bernoda sebagai anak anak allah yang tidak bercela di tengah tengah angkatan yang bengkok hatinya dan yang sesat ini sehingga kamu bercahaya di antara mereka seperti bintang bintang di dunia
3831503 kamu adalah garam dunia jika garam itu menjadi tawar dengan apakah ia diasinkan tidak ada lagi gunanya selain dibuang dan diinjak orang kamu adalah terang dunia kota yang terletak di atas gunung tidak mungkin tersembunyi lagipula orang tidak menyalakan pelita lalu meletakkannya di bawah gantang melainkan di atas kaki dian sehingga menerangi semua orang di dalam rumah itu demikianlah hendaknya terangmu bercahaya di depan orang supaya mereka melihat perbuatanmu yang baik dan memuliakan bapamu yang di sorga
3831504 tiap tiap manusia kepunyaan allah diperlengkapi untuk setiap perbuatan baik
3831505 jika seorang tahu bagaimana ia harus berbuat baik tetapi ia tidak melakukannya ia berdosa
3831506 sebab jikalau kamu berbuat baik kepada orang yang berbuat baik kepada kamu apakah jasamu orang orang berdosapun berbuat demikian
3831507 segala sesuatu yang kamu kehendaki supaya orang perbuat kepadamu perbuatlah demikian juga kepada mereka itulah isi seluruh hukum taurat dan kitab para nabi
3831508 janganlah kita jemu jemu berbuat baik karena apabila sudah datang waktunya kita akan menuai jika kita tidak menjadi lemah
3831509 kita tahu bahwa kita sudah berpindah dari dalam maut ke dalam hidup yaitu karena kita mengasihi saudara kita barangsiapa tidak mengasihi ia tetap di dalam maut
3831510 ada seorang kaya yang selalu berpakaian jubah ungu dan kain halus dan setiap hari ia bersukaria dalam kemewahan dan ada seorang pengemis bernama lazarus badannya penuh dengan borok berbaring dekat pintu rumah orang kaya itu dan ingin menghilangkan laparnya dengan apa yang jatuh dari meja orang kaya itu malahan anjing anjing datang dan menjilat boroknya kemudian matilah orang miskin itu lalu dibawa oleh malaikat malaikat ke pangkuan abraham orang kaya itu juga mati lalu dikubur dan sementara ia menderita sengsara di alam maut ia memandang ke atas dan dari jauh dilihatnya abraham dan lazarus duduk di pangkuannya lalu ia berseru katanya bapa abraham kasihanilah aku suruhlah lazarus supaya ia mencelupkan ujung jarinya ke dalam air dan menyejukkan lidahku sebab aku sangat kesakitan dalam nyala api ini tetapi abraham berkata anak ingatlah bahwa engkau telah menerima segala yang baik sewaktu hidupmu sedangkan lazarus segala yang buruk sekarang ia mendapat hiburan dan engkau sangat menderita
3831511 demikianlah hendaknya terangmu bercahaya di depan orang supaya mereka melihat perbuatanmu yang baik dan memuliakan bapamu yang di sorga
3831512 there is no doubt that american workers are feeling the pressure from escalating energy and food prices as well as a slumping real estate market but the majority are making retirement a priority and staying the course
3831513 i just feel it in my gut im not where i need to be
3831514 but ukrainian president yuschenko is taking such a courageous stand against the russians arent you proud
3831515 i counted everyday i would tell them its day number 414 until we play
3831516 so the kids get a laugh now that we are down to 18 days they say coach what are you going to do when you cant count anymore
3831517 as you talk about a normal freshman class youre talking about 24 25 players
3831518 i really wanted to be a part of this groundbreaking moment
3831519 it was real exciting to see all of the facilities get put up from when it was nothing in the ground to what it is now
3831520 everybody was happy to hear that we are having a football program
3831521 especially whenever homecoming comes so that they dont have to go to other schools
3831522 its a nervousness that ive never felt before in my life
3831523 because this has come from absolutely nowhere when i took over 2 years ago to where we are today
3831524 maybe not quite as much as maybe we would have liked to have not from the standpoint of the snappers and the holders and the kickers but schematically
3831525 one of the things that im very pleased with is mark house and trevor stuart our two deep snappers
3831526 youre always worried because regardless of who the kicker is if the snapper doesnt do his job you could have the worlds greatest kicker and it wouldnt make a difference and the kickers level of confidence has got to be that he trusts those guys that theyre going to get the ball placed really well
3831527 the best part of it was that every single one of the snaps kicks and operations was under 1 25 seconds
3831528 thats clearly more than acceptable you could live with 1 3 seconds but you would like to be under 1 3 so jay wooten did a nice job as did casey barth they were very accurate and they made every single one of their attempts so we want to keep pushing those guys
3831529 we want to not only be able to have a good frontline of 11 guys but weve really got to develop some of the backup players
3831530 and most notably thats where a lot of the freshmen are especially some of the young linebackers like zach brown and dion guy those guys can make a big addition to the football team but until they understand the schemes punt protection kickoff coverage lane responsibilities then theyre not ready for primetime yet
3831531 he came in and went into this office and started shooting

3831534 the divorcement of men from the soil the main source of poverty
3831535 we have cleared the way for a straight single tax fight in oregon
3831536 all the work we have done for direct legislation has been done with the single tax in view but we have not talked single tax because it was not the question before the house
3831537 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3831538 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3831539 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3831540 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3831541 we were asking people who opted in to volunteer a few hours
3831542 people are really enthused and the response has been fantastic
3831543 have you always wanted to model but dont know where to start
3831544 those of us who continue to see the millions of blacks who died crossing the atlantic and the displacement of what we had in africa as proof that slavery was a bad institution dont understand the mechanics of human development and evolution
3831545 we are not in any imminent danger of filing for bankruptcy
3831546 those other restaurants that filed their concepts havent remained relevant ours has
3831547 moved in recent years to a more expansive menu of grilled fried and saut ed fare including angus beef steaks and bolognese pasta and drinks such as pomegranate margaritas
3831548 in america we are a culture of african american christians caucasian christians hispanic christians asian christians and on and on
3831549 that isnt scriptural and you know i dont want to limit jesus to just my culture
3831550 if you are going to south america to work with a people group you dont know anything about you google it and find out what they eat what they wear how they speak how they act
3831551 you are excited you want to know everything you dont want to offend anyone
3831552 in effect we are saying that our own culture is more important than jesus
3831553 christ called us not to be ethnics but to be christians
3831554 we are positionally holy god has saved us through his son jesus but we are not practically holy
3831555 if you dont have a concept of gods holiness you wont understand pursuing practical holiness
3831556 jesus has redeemed you from a life of silliness and folly he said
3831557 you were saved to pursue holiness why in the world would you want to go back to your old way of living
3831558 hide it in your heart you must have unhurried and unhindered time with god in the word
3831559 holy people go out bragging about god dont isolate yourself do good deeds among the gentiles
3831560 a company will incorporate offshore where there are no taxes
3831561 that parent company charges the u s company lots of money for things like the trademark for the company logo the u s company says i made 50 million but my stupid parent company charged me 50 million for the logo the u s company gets to deduct the royalty fees as an expense and move profits to the parent company offshore in a tax free haven
3831562 even in a good year a lot of firms are failing
3831563 general motors lost 10 billion in 2005 so how much corporate profit tax would you expect them to pay american airlines lost almost a billion dollars what would you want them to pay when theyre already cutting people they pay when theyre profitable
3831564 dont we all fill out our tax returns as aggressively as we know how and take every deduction and credit were entitled to even if theyre unprincipled even if theyre in the tax code only because congress thinks we will appreciate them for subsidizing us
3831565 its common sense corporations dont earn profits in many years
3831566 all that said i think there probably is large tax avoidance by u s multinational corporations but in my view thats driven by the very high u s corporate tax rate a corporate tax rate cut is long overdue
3831567 we have a pretty high nominal corporate tax rate but effectively its not high at all
3831568 there are many tax avoidance strategies wed be far better off with a simpler structure that made sure taxes were actually paid by corporations
3831569 the united states has the second highest combined statutory corporate tax rate among the organization for economic cooperation and development countries yet is tied with hungary in raising the fourth lowest amount of combined corporate income tax revenue relative to gdp in 2004

3831590 people are worried about the impact the credit crunch is going to have on consumers
3831591 the retail sales number this morning was another data point suggesting that the economy is weakening and the consumer is pulling back on their purchases
3831592 all of this volatility is usually the precursor to a large move
3831593 when you have a lot of money on the sidelines and theres a lot of tension and a lot of nervousness out there thats usually indicative of a bottom
3831594 you need to make your presence known to people in places such as the student affairs office

3831604 one thing arliss said that really struck me was that our face will be the face of our collegiate ministry
3831605 we have to be willing to do the work and take responsibility
3831606 its good just to realize we do know a lot about how to minister to college students
3831607 its also a great time to be around all these other leaders who deal with the same issues and hear what they do

3831619 consumers have a variety of choices in terms of everyday products
3831620 we advise consumers not to panic over a few brands decisions to raise their prices

3831644 aug 15 will mark the 63rd anniversary of japans surrender ending world war ii however the japanese government has yet to officially apologize or compensate former comfort women
3831645 the key to ending violence against women is to make those responsible compensate the victims
3831646 worldwide ai organizations have initiated a campaign calling on all its members to pressure their governments to pass resolutions urging japan to apologize and to compensate former comfort women
3831647 we hope the campaign will create some international pressure on the japanese government
3831648 with several of my colleagues across party lines we have initiated a resolution asking japan to recognize such war crimes educate its people about them and compensate the victims
3831649 hopefully the resolution will be passed during the next legislative session
3831650 knowing that they have not been forgotten and that people are still fighting for their dignity we hope their souls may rest in peace after reading the resolution
3831651 the council has even kept the list of academics who will sit on the application review committee confidential
3831652 although the indo pacific humpback dolphins are prevalent in many parts of the pacific including china and hong kong the eastern taiwan strait variety is a special subgroup that is characterized by bluish gray spots all over the body during adolescent years which then turn completely white in adulthood
3831653 the trait is not observed in other indo pacific humpbacks and is a genetic distinction only seen in the taiwanese variety
3831654 because the dolphins live in a 5km stretch of coastline between miaoli and chiayi industrial zones including the mailiao industrial area tongsiao and taichung coal burning power plants as well as changpin industrial park have had a serious impact on their environment
3831655 in addition fishing in the areas also hurts the animals and many have scratches and cuts from fishing nets or other manmade devices
3831656 when the dolphins were first discovered in 2002 their population was about 200 within five years their population had halved if no conservation efforts are made in 10 years there may only be 25 of them left which would make them functionally extinct
3831657 we filed a request with the council more than six months ago we are happy to see that it is finally making concrete plans to address this problem
3831658 in the past 20 years applications to import pandas from china were filed on at least five occasions
3831659 we have been completely excluded from the decision making process
3831660 requests that the council make the decision making process transparent were never answered the council has even kept the list of academics who will sit on the application review committee confidential
3831661 the council said it would keep the list confidential to avoid unnecessary disruptions and minimize the pressure on the members
3831662 in fact the council has said it would announce today whether the taipei city zoo or the leofoo park will be home to the pandas which shows us that the government has already approved the importation
3831663 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3831664 they could make what they do look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time come up with the right moves on the nuclear issue
3831665 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3831666 if japan breaks this agreement all would collapse we will also take necessary measures
3831667 according to initial estimates the bomb was made up of 20kg of explosives
3831668 now the army and the people are being targeted when it used to be the politicians who were the targets
3831669 this explosion is not in either lebanon or syrias interests especially since president suleiman is expected to visit damascus today
3831670 this is complete nonsense next magazine has made similar nonsensical speculation twice before
3831671 everyone knows that shih is very competent she was even voted the most popular cabinet official in a poll conducted by the democratic progressive party
3831672 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3831673 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3831674 it is a result of the alert vigilant and patriotic manner they have conducted their day to day duties
3831675 addressing the concerns of the displaced remains our top priority
3831676 we need food we need clean water we cant bear the hardship of being evicted from our homes we need to live normal lives again
3831677 me my wife and four young children stay there waiting for food assistance but we cannot be in this situation for long
3831678 it was so cold at night and so hot at daytime this is how miserable our life has become because of the fighting
3831679 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3831680 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3831681 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years
3831682 india did not try to draw mileage on that and get an outline for a real agreement
3831683 we missed the opportunity and we wont get another right now
3831684 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3831685 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time ive never seen anything like this in my career for software

3831687 el triple shock que padece la econom a espa ola est afectando de manera concordante y con efectos reforzados al sector automovil stico
3831688 est destruyendo puestos de trabajo y detrayendo potenciales compradores de coches nuevos o usados
3831689 el endurecimiento de las condiciones de oferta de pr stamos da a a un sector que financia el 80 por ciento de las operaciones de venta
3831690 detrae de las familias capacidad de gasto y endeudamiento alejando la posibilidad de compra de un coche
3831691 su tendencia creciente hace pensar que la oferta de veh culos se est ajustando a los l mites superiores de cada tramo con el fin de optimizar el importe sin renunciar a la potencia
3831692 expectativas y confianza en el marco de nuestro modelo de prosperidad
3831693 vamos a aportar todo tipo de medidas que generen confianza eficacia y eficiencia
3831694 maquinaria de la prosperidad y el bienestar contin e hacia delante
3831695 es importante que liguemos prosperidad y empleo con bienestar calidad de vida con expectativas de crecimiento de inversi n y de generaci n de empleo
3831696 en definitiva que liguemos la confianza de las personas y de las familias en la calidad de vida en la comunitat con la confianza de quienes tienen que seguir invirtiendo para que la prosperidad y el empleo sean referentes inexcusables del futuro inmediato de la comunitat
3831697 queremos seguir generando expectativas para que el empleo sea una realidad en la comunitat
3831698 cada puesto de trabajo es la mejor iniciativa social que se puede poner en marcha
3831699 la prosperidad est directamente ligada a las posibilidades del la sociedad valenciana para seguir generando bienestar
3831700 adecuaci n de las viviendas a las necesidades de las personas mayores o de los dependientes
3831701 son por cada una de las personas que puedan vivir en una misma vivienda
3831702 nosotros no damos la ayuda por la vivienda sino por la persona
3831703 todos los valencianos tienen que tener una vivienda digna para poder vivir y para eso es fundamental desarrollar el plan estrat gico de la vivienda
3831704 i cant imagine getting on with public hearings much before february
3831705 russia will be a pariah it is a pariah its difficult to do anything other than reduce your exposure
3831706 we continue to evaluate our liquidity and our alternatives to improve the balance sheet
3831707 well continue to look at that to make sure that we have adequate liquidity to successfully implement this very significant kind of transformation
3831708 that is our intent but also i dont want to walk away from the fact that theres lots of variables hitting this business every day
3831709 our role is to make sure that were as flexible as we can be to kind of take those things coming at us both the good and the bad
3831710 what we really need to do is tell people that were back in the car business
3831711 we have a real opportunity on our hand over the next couple of years to show people that we have world class cars that were bringing here to the us
3831712 it was just after a typhoon and it was really dangerous
3831713 i saw this other crazy guy out there he was teaching himself hed been reading magazines and he had a board totally unsuitable for him but he had a bag of guts and the aloha spirit
3831714 when i brought surfing here people said you are crazy you are in the wrong place you forgot the sail
3831715 we have near perfect waves half a day every day they may not be the biggest but the water is clean its uncrowded and there is no hype
3831716 is like youre not good enough to surf here so you surf at that end of the beach
3831717 we eventually want to make all boards by hand based on the customers personal characteristics
3831718 taiwanese have discovered surfing in the last 10 years theyve discovered the end of it the shiny bit they havent completely found out the aloha spirit yet
3831719 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3831720 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3831721 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3831722 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3831723 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3831724 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3831725 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the united states deal on its own with some of the issues
3831726 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3831727 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3831728 has a responsibility to follow through its promise to halt the attacks and remove russian troops from the country
3831729 i fully support the olympics in china the peoples republic of china deserves to play host to the games
3831730 abuse of young girls and in some cases boys by at least 100 indian peacekeepers over a period of several years
3831731 reiterates in the strongest possible terms that such behavior if substantiated is wholly unacceptable
3831732 should be taken as soon as possible against those found to be involved in such misconduct
3831733 that the allegations will be promptly and thoroughly investigated and if proven strict and exemplary action would be taken as per the law
3831734 highly values indias long standing and valuable support for united nations peacekeeping
3831735 his respect for all those peacekeepers from india and other troop contributing countries who serve with honor and commitment
3831736 the misconduct of a few should not diminish the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the large number of blue helmets who serve the cause of peace
3831737 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3831738 i think the bottom line is we lost focus we did and that focus is coming back
3831739 i think fundamentally our service is sound it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend
3831740 we are not going to grow our way out of this and its highly unlikely that we will tax our way out either
3831741 who says and can you give your answer in numeric form
3831742 we are not going to grow our way out of this and its highly unlikely we will tax our way out either
3831743 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a ceasefire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3831744 georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3831745 the dalai lama i have a moral responsibility to convey the message
3831746 immense sufferings in the past half a century and that saddens
3831747 disappointed which is also a development as compared to previous reports
3831748 yet we still want to continue the contacts and the details of which will be discussed in the forthcoming session of the tibetan parliament in exile in september
3831749 a responsibility to bring china into the mainstream society and create genuine friendship
3831750 yet the international community has to be firm when it comes to values like human rights religious freedom and rule of law
3831751 when the economy takes a turn for a worse everyone starts tightening their belts
3831752 but one place that is often overlooked is the amount of taxes they pay
3831753 we have found that the wealthiest people in the country are paying as little as 5 of their income in taxes while the average person is paying upwards of 30 50 of their income in taxes
3831754 its amazing how im going to save and how much this is going to help me this year it looks like im going to save 30 000 in taxes
3831755 meaning that half of the income that i usually pay in taxes im going to get to keep
3831756 it is important for people to realize that americans are making far more money than they are actually taking home
3831757 a very large percentage of their weekly salary is lost to taxes before they ever cash a check this money can be recovered and used to pay for rising expenses when you realize just how much money you are losing right off the top tax savings is like getting an instant pay raise from the government
3831758 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3831759 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3831760 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3831761 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3831762 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3831763 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3831764 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3831765 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3831766 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3831767 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3831768 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3831769 test results from all seven children show that none of them are related to each other or to the couple who claim to be their parents
3831770 we served them last evening to our repeat customers who were staying in top notch rooms
3831771 on a health check up trip after having passed entrance examinations of high schools in the developed eastern areas
3831772 had my father really wished that this novel not be released he would have destroyed it himself
3831773 would not be in the best interest of the community
3831774 its dangerous for him to come out not only for us but for himself
3831775 its not age per se that when you get to 80 its all over with
3831776 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
3831777 he confessed to 1 000 burglaries and i have been able to find 180 victims so far
3831778 i hope to perform well and show the chinese what weve got dont call us zhongguo taibei taipei china anymore
3831779 when i received the medal all i could see was the flag representing taiwan all i could hear was the song representing taiwan and in my heart i wanted to say go taiwan
3831780 wir gehen davon aus dass die gro e mehrheit nicht mit nachzahlungen rechnen muss
3831781 keine rentner m ssen ngste haben sich einem steuerstrafverfahren gegen berzusehen
3831782 many chinese feel safer living in a gap between the present and past in a virtual reality world symbolized by the internet and video games
3831783 the country can now attract banks and service industries and avoid the natural resource curse
3831784 we are making a contribution by helping to build a more civil society
3831785 its the real lesson here the importance of decent governments
3831786 he is just another person but maybe from a different planet said alexander sukhorukov who swam the anchor leg for the second place russians
3831787 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3831788 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3831789 you are so cute i could just eat you up
3831790 the velocity control and breaking ball were all working as well as they can
3831791 today we face japan which will be a tough game this is good for morale
3831792 we just do the legwork and earn 35 yuan for each ticket
3831793 they dont lose anything even if the tickets are so expensive that they dont attract a lot of buyers
3831794 could we contend a strip in relation to riads hotels restaurants
3831795 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3831796 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3831797 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3831798 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3831799 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3831800 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3831801 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well
3831802 could we contend a strip in relation to riads hotels restaurants
3831803 im looking forward to the wcoop events especially the main event as it should have a huge prize pool
3831804 as for now ill make the most of supernova elite by playing a lot of cash and hopefully a few epts this year ill try to earn myself a porsche in the not too distant future too
3831805 i eventually moved to the 2 cent tables and now i regularly play 50 1 nlhe cash games
3831806 i was playing really well made it to the final table and willed my way to the top two
3831807 we have a good team when its not playing like this
3831808 you go out there and play with showboating if we dont take care of these things were going to have a lot of problems
3831809 i think its really exciting to compete here at home
3831810 what i want to do most is spend time with my parents because since the last olympics until now ive only spent six days with them
3831811 could we contend a strip in relation to riads hotels restaurants
3831812 i give my strength to them i fight here as they fight there
3831813 i knew it was an important game to get out of the bracket and i knew it was an important game for the georgian people
3831814 its very important for the georgian people to make a small happiness
3831815 my answer is simple lets fight on the fields not outside of them
3831816 we just want to end the conflict all the history between us was friendly
3831817 if they were georgian that certainly would have been an influence
3831818 i dont realize whats happening its the first gold for france in beijing and im very proud its a crazy stuff
3831819 our father taught us the value of hard work i always trained with my younger brother training together is very good motivation it pushes me to succeed hopefully this will start a new era in french wrestling
3831820 i dont think it was very fair the first round i lost but the second i wasnt so sure
3831821 one hour and two minutes is a really really tough race
3831822 now is the moment to enjoy and to be happy and proud that i won
3831823 im very very happy and very proud of this ride today and to go home with two medals
3831824 i worked very hard for this and it paid off i pictured myself on the top step but this is brilliant
3831825 the olympic games is every four years and this race is one day and you cannot give up until you cross that finish line
3831826 someone told me at the top that i had the best time but i really couldnt celebrate until the last person crossed the finish line
3831827 the spirit is right the team responded well as did the crowd so im satisfied
3831828 we need the two weeks of training before the second leg because as could be seen we arent continuously sharp yet but we were also quite tidy today
3831829 he is a serious lad who has always had a sense of goal

3831832 uefa will contact the clubs and national associations concerned in due time to communicate the rules applicable to this single match
3831833 weve coordinated for more than 20 months thats all for this event so we should be focused and concentrate very well this gold is so important to my life
3831834 we have a lot of different athletes from a lot of different provinces of course were very rigorous in our training that is why we achieve these results
3831835 we have reached the stage where the whole situation needs correcting
3831836 we need the excesses skimming off the top it is difficult to say that without making it appear that we are trying to sanitize everything that is not what we are saying at all we want the passion and rivalries what we dont want is some of that blatant disrespect and abuse
3831837 im slightly concerned ill be the first sent to the stands as i was last year for a rather innocuous decision last season but i think the ideas terrific to cut out the excesses
3831838 at times and this came into sharp focus last season incidents crop up where the mark is overstepped and player and manager behavior can become unacceptable
3831839 the referees have a responsibility too in forging better relationships with team captains and the other players and by communicating in the right way it will help the players and that will make the game better for everyone
3831840 its unfair to pick one person or player or one club
3831841 i could show you a hundred videos of players committing offenses weve all done it
3831842 referees have got a tough job and dont have access to replays we realize that
3831843 it wont be matey matey now there will still be the tempo the aggression that makes this the best league in the world the premiership is the best for those reasons and we need to get a balance
3831844 helps to ensure that labor is rewarded according to its productivity
3831845 when the opponent is shooting that well what else can you do
3831846 there were high expectations for the team ahead of the games sometimes if you dont receive so much attention it can be easier for the athletes to put on a normal performance
3831847 i beat him so i feel like i can beat anybody so bring it on
3831848 they had a rough day today so im just trying to do my best to help britain
3831849 i knew my score was high but i didnt realize it was the new olympic record

3831856 i would sincerely hope that the italian parliament would pass this law
3831857 we athletes go through major sacrifices to get to this level it would be the right thing to do to remove the taxes from what we get here it would be a very good thing
3831858 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3831859 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3831860 this means they will have to walk one metre plus nine inches
3831861 i have to have the wheels of the wheelie bin protruding onto the pavement so they can see the bin has to be collected
3831862 the compromise is that i push it out so the driver and his mate can see it but it will not block the pavement
3831863 they will now have to walk an extra nine inches to get my bin i have been given special dispensation
3831864 i was told twigs and leaves could fall out onto the operatives and cause serious injuries
3831865 we make every effort to collect bins in all sorts of circumstances we have a very satisfactory and comprehensive refuse service
3831866 i am quite satisfied we are doing the best we can to facilitate the best collection of rubbish we can in west wiltshire
3831867 i couldnt see anything for the last 100m my goggles pretty much filled up with water it kept getting worse and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest
3831868 but its fine i wanted to break the record and wanted to go 1 51 or better but in the circumstances i guess its not too bad

3831876 the monthly subsidies for homeroom teaching should also be raised by nt 2 000
3831877 i dont think the numbers are signaling the type of deep recessions we saw in the late 1990s and early 2001

3831888 if ing is in pain its mainly as an investor and not as an originator of risky assets
3831889 financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits which we see continuing into 2009

3831894 the weak dollar has become a major driver of economic growth
3831895 the dollar is probably where it should be as it has made us products competitive in a world where global trade is central to economic growth
3831896 us growth is doing much better than domestic spending would indicate both because exports are booming and because some of the weakness in domestic demand is being passed on to the rest of the world through lower imports
3831897 august has thus far been a one way staircase for bullion prices
3831898 the recent volatility in most of these metals and currency markets appears to indicate a shift in the long term trends of the dollar the euro and the precious metals
3831899 in ideal years farmers will harvest 90 percent and lose 10 percent to the usual factors nonetheless the usda says they will harvest more than 91 percent so thats perplexing

3831904 she first said she came out of curiosity then she came for the singing now she says shes got to come see her friends
3831905 we did not anticipate the crowd that we would have
3831906 we never dreamed that people would be coming here from literally all over the united states
3831907 when god ordained in the new covenant the use of the human voice to accompany our hearts in singing there are many many people that respect that
3831908 the diana singing still emphasizes that and i think that is the basic appeal
3831909 congratulations for having to deal with us all in this monkey house amp all the long nights of banning spam accounts

3831914 you desperately need to call your girlfriend but she is a talker and you dont want to spend an hour on the phone with her because you would much rather watch the game with your buddies leave her a sweet voicemail and get a reprieve for the night
3831915 hey im going to watch insert game here with my friends do you want me to call you later if its not too late
3831916 you go to a week long convention for work in las vegas and blow 5 000 the first night at the roulette table you need to call your wife and tell her why she should hold off on making the monthly mortgage payment her voicemail will be much more understanding than she will
3831917 you are dating quite a few people at the same time you dont want to leave them all text messages because there is nothing romantic about that but a nice voicemail to each would score you points
3831918 your task o roman is to rule and bring to men the arts of government to impose upon them the arts of peace to spare those who submit to subdue the arrogant
3831919 its just due to the tough economic conditions that prevail today weve been through a lot of ups and downs over the years but this will be it
3831920 i thought we got some great work in today i thought both sides were very professional in their approach we have a little different schemes on both sides of the ball and it was good work for dallas and obviously the broncos we have a practice this afternoon and im looking forward to that
3831921 they have a different type of offense and a different type of defense we get a chance to work against a 3 4 look and they get a chance to take a look at a four man front i thought it was good for both teams it was a very healthy practice and there was some good fresh hitting you go against somebody where you dont know their tendencies so everybody plays a little bit more honest and its a good evaluation process for us
3831922 what you want to do when youre taking a look at your otas when youre taking a look at your summer camp you want to find your best 53 guys that can play you want to get better as a scheme offensively defensively and special teams this is a little bit different here normally that third week of practice you get tired of hitting against each other this is a good changeup for both teams where you get a chance to go against different schemes and different people i thought it was good for both squads
3831923 normally the first couple of weeks of training camp you want to install your offense and defense to go against a team too early would kind of take away what you are trying to put in as your basic fundamentals to installing your offense defense and special teams usually its better before your second preseason game because you have all of that installation in you have a preseason game under your belt you know who you want to evaluate and you get a chance to do it against different people
3831924 unii dintre angajatorii romani cred ca statul in scoala e pierdere de vreme ca meseria se invata numai la locul de munca
3831925 i thought we got some great work in today i thought both sides were very professional in their approach we have a little different schemes on both sides of the ball and it was good work for dallas and obviously the broncos we have a practice this afternoon and im looking forward to that

3831929 you change it up we went there last year obviously they are playing at our facility so they are going to come here we will probably do the same thing next year if we play the cowboys in preseason
3831930 we brought in a couple of corners poole and cb wale dada that we thought would give us more depth at that position guys that we feel have more of a chance to make our football team sometimes you make changes after a game based on how they play we didnt feel like either of those players cb lamont reid and cb christian morton could make our football team so we went in a different direction and brought some guys in that we thought could compete for possibly making our squad
3831931 he has been playing with the first team and second team throughout camp we have some competition there at middle linebacker and we will find out at the end of camp who steps up and who is our starter we have two guys koutouvides and lb nate webster that are practicing extremely well and we want to give both guys a chance to practice and play with the first team unit part of the evaluation process is how they play in practice and how thy play here in the games so we will have a chance to do both
3831932 i dont know if he picks his play up any more brandon has been doing this throughout camp i think you get a chance to see him against different people and obviously a very good football team in the cowboys its always nice to see a guy step up and make some plays like he did
3831933 naturally it does players and coaches you want to perform in front of your peers you want to practice well you want to play well and at the same time we want to evaluate a lot of people we have a chance to do it all today
3831934 to be honest with you they take advantage of an opportunity rb selvin young was obviously injured at texas but he came in here stayed healthy and took advantage of an opportunity any time you get a scholarship and are averaging about five and a half to six yards per carry at texas you know you have a big upside and he is taking advantage of that opportunity here
3831935 well he guaranteed 2 000 yards i think so he is going to be much better we have a long way to go though
3831936 i thought it went well obviously they are one of the best teams in the nfl theyre big physical and fast it went well though we are going to go back and look at the tapes to see what we did well and what we didnt do so well on but its definitely good to get somebody else in here instead of the same defenses over and over again i thought it went well
3831937 thats exactly what it is for us we have a young team with a lot of new guys dallas is one of the top three teams in the nfl it gives us a good measuring stick to see where we are at and exactly how far we need to go
3831938 dallas is dallas and they are going to do whatever they are going to do we are the broncos and we are not going to try and emulate them we are going to handle ourselves exactly the way our owner does and the way mike shanahan does we are going to be first class and go about our business
3831939 i talked with him before practice and he has dealt with it for a long time he said it was manageable just like i have been doing for the last four or five months he went through his career with it and i dont see any reason why i cant
3831940 we have two young guys on the outside ryan clady and ryan harris they are young but they are fighting i think they are going to be good if not great tackles in the future both ryans got a taste against houston and this is going to be a good test for them in the next two days im comfortable and i think they have done a great job so far
3831941 you see some guys breathing a little bit harder brandon marshall was gassed because he was so juiced up you have adrenaline running and it is fun it is game like out here and you get to see somebody different go against different looks and gauge where you are at i love doing it
3831942 excitotoxins are biochemical substances usually amino acids amino acid analogs or amino acid derivatives that can react with specialized neuronal receptors glutamate receptors in the brain or spinal cord that can be responsible for causing death or injury to a wide array of neurons
3831943 im tremendously disappointed weve been here nearly five years we have lots of friends and family
3831944 but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we go
3831945 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives
3831946 theyre quite sad you didnt make the ball over the net
3831947 on a double fault youre like ok double faults happen
3831948 but theyre like oh no how bad for the guy so its actually quite a unique experience its a different cultural experience in a way honestly i enjoy it
3831949 the longer the point went you know the happier they were
3831950 sometimes they get quite excited during the point which is quite distracting for us
3831951 but its very difficult to explain to them in chinese during the point we are really fighting hard to play each ball and you hear such loud applause during it and you kind of get confused
3831952 now it actually makes me get excited theyre so into the point its actually kind of cool
3831953 i led in the abramoff hearings in the in the obscure indian affairs committee for which people are still testifying and going to jail
3831954 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican
3831955 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington

3831960 this 11th hour ruling from the is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3831961 as president will fight to maintain the strong protections of the
3831962 in this case it was determined that we need to move forward in a timely fashion
3831963 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3831964 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that shape him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president

3831967 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home
3831968 look at the underlying trends the economy is a huge issue president george w bushs ratings are terrible
3831969 saya tidak menyangka buku ini akan menjadi fenomena karena terus terang dalam menulis buku ini saya hanya beritikad menulis pengalaman rekan saya bukan untuk merusak aliran agama apalagi sampai menyinggung agama islam
3831970 belasan kali novel ini didiskusikan belasan kali pula saya memanen sumpah serapah dari berbagai pihak umumnya saya dituding sebagai penghina agama dengan kualitas kebencian yang luar biasa
3831971 kalau dilihat dari isinya maka sebetulnya buku ini jangan dikaitkan dengan kehidupan nyata apalagi syarat dengan kontroversi tertutama dengan agama islam buku ini sebaiknya hanya dilihat dari karya sastranya saja apalagi buku ini seperti novel yang tentunya syarat dengan kontribusi si penulis untuk memberikan opini dalam tulisannya sehingga menarik untuk dibaca

3831975 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
3831976 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
3831977 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
3831978 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
3831979 we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different

3831989 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win
3831990 it simply does not have the built in domestic constituency of defense programs
3831991 as an example the f 22 aircraft is produced by companies in 44 states thats 88 senators
3831992 military force usually has the opposite effect from what is intended
3831993 we need to believe in the power of american diplomacy and we should not believe a military conflict with iran is inevitable
3831994 our first impulse should be a serious and patient and persistent diplomatic effort too often in our national debate we focus on the military option and give short shrift to the diplomatic option
3831995 we are excited to bring an indie inspired new intellectual property to the ea casual entertainment label with henry hatsworth that fuses together two styles of gameplay utilizing the two nintendo ds screens like never before

3832000 i have forbidden my family from eating rice and bread
3832001 in my opinion these are not essential to their survival
3832002 the lifting of long standing fuel subsidies by the government in february 2008 has certainly worsened inflation
3832003 this increase helped the poorest of the poor subsisting in precarious living conditions but for those who are not at that level this change had little impact in reversing the government salary cuts of 1993 which in real terms is a 70 percent cut after the devaluation of the cfa franc west african currency in 1994
3832004 the less people are able to afford with what they make the more people who will enter the informal economy
3832005 these companies operate clandestinely do not pay taxes or provide any social security to their workers
3832006 the more expensive life becomes the more people will be ready to do anything even kill in order to eat

3832014 its a really degrading horrible reference to a person with a disability

3832059 yes i was a schoolteacher no the song is not autobiographical im interested in obsession and vladimir nabokovs lolita is a fascinating study in dangerous obsession i transposed this idea to a relationship between teacher and his pupil
3832060 my original intention was to make it a seductive love song but what i ended up with was something much darker my life had invaded the song everything around me seemed to be disintegrating my marriage my band my sanity and this at a time when from the outside i appeared to be one of the most successful musicians of the world

3832063 im glad i did it and i will be glad when we finally finish everything in life ends im not particularly sentimental things should end so that something new can be created
3832064 reforming the police was the last thing i would have done logically which is exactly what made it so appealing
3832065 it was hard work i knew it would be tough but it was also very rewarding in many ways certainly financially but also spiritually interesting learning that all of us had advanced from the young men that we were but also stayed more or less the same

3832067 im not in a bubble im on the internet every day i read the papers i know whats going on moving around the world i see the global village at work i see how connected we really are the problems that we have in south america are related to the problems we have in europe but that sense of connection is true for everybody this information thing is accelerating i dont know where its taking us but ive got a feeling that its good human beings evolve through crisis we are certainly heading for a crisis
3832068 i think optimism is really the only strategy you can have but its going to demand innovation and great minds coming together
3832069 there are equally fantastic solutions to touring can you imagine zeppelins going around the world with tours underneath them with a stage the band all the equipment and lights and just lowering themselves into a car park somewhere and then off they float crazy and fantastic but who knows we certainly cant rely on cheap oil any more

3832107 and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
3832108 they are extremely close a number of members of the hollywood community including brad pitt ben affleck and matt damon offered to help raise funds for barack but it was with george that he struck up this amazing affinity

3832110 i ve only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone i ve spent more time with senator mccain he did my tv show then i have with senator obama

3832145 wed start shooting at nine or 10 in the morning and go until we were done then hed go into his living quarters and invite friends and theyd jam to all hours of the morning
3832146 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
3832147 there was no plan at all i mean absolutely nothing
3832148 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it
3832149 this is supposed to be the informal part of the show where we faint or do whatever we want to do especially me
3832150 because he hadnt been touring he had gotten into the movie thing i know his feeling was im getting back before the public this way

3832166 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge

3832168 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3832169 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3832170 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there

3832191 it involved reconstitution of an old process its quite challenging to reconstitute something you havent done in awhile
3832192 we are pleased that weve been able to resolve these issues but i think one should not underestimate the challenge of stopping a production process and then many years later trying to resume it thats been tough

3832450 but we have a serious home grown pollution problem right here and canadians ranging from the very young to the very old are paying the price
3832451 both of which rise during pollution episodes and in the few days afterwards and explain in significant part the number of acute deaths due to air pollution
3832452 canada gets a fair bit of pollution from the american midwest which drifts north comes across through ontario and continues right on through to quebec
3832453 sometimes people in rural areas think theyre escaping very nicely because they dont live in downtown wherever the fact is these masses of air pollution move across the countryside and some of our worst air pollution occurs in rural areas because it just happens to be downwind

3832464 dispatchers should not be subject to discipline for using their judgment to help the captain determine the appropriate fuel load for a given flight
3832465 any attempt by airline management to inappropriately influence or intimidate the dispatchers is extremely misguided

3832515 we recognise the sovereignty and independence of georgia but territorial integrity its just another matter
3832516 south ossetia and abkhazia never were part of georgia as an independent country

3832559 has already won unexpected recognition for its national anthem that was played in the opening ceremony
3832560 a wonderful anthem that sounds like it was written for a stroll along the seine
3832561 there is no other fair way to compare national anthems are the same the world over a short classical piece meant to stir up pride
3832562 after listening to 205 of them i have realised there are actually just two types of anthems the perfunctory lifeless ones and those that make the effort to be different its a shame that 190 fall into the first group
3832563 have no chance of winning a medal they should be cheered for their music
3832564 i have been contemplating this since long before the series came out so this just seemed to be the perfect timing
3832565 as the housing boom exploded in 2001 so did the number of people rushing into the mortgage industry with loan originators leading the way but as their numbers rose each year 66 a day in 2005 so did the number of former criminals with home sales rising more than 20 percent a year in parts of florida mortgage companies were hiring loan originators at an unprecedented rate state records show back then it was such a feeding frenzy said david velazquez 37 a former loan originator in broward who served time in prison for drug trafficking people were saying we need loan originators well train you it was so busy they were pulling in anyone they could in all more than 5 300 people with criminal histories rushed into floridas mortgage industry as loan originators since 2000 even for people who had five or more convictions there were no impediments to getting in
3832566 if they were trying to stir some urgency or interest i probably wouldnt have been the one
3832567 state leaders involved in mortgage industry legislation over the past five years said they favored the new proposals but questioned why the agency took so long to press for changes
3832568 there will be no greater tribute to our maturity as a society than if we can make these buildings around us empty of workers as silent monuments to the time when government played a larger role than it deserved or could adequately fill
3832569 i knew we had a problem i had no idea how bad
3832570 the state had the seventh highest rate of mortgage fraud in the country in 2003 it ranked 5th in 2004 3rd in 2005 and 1st in 2006 and 2007 by last year one out of every five fraudulent mortgage applications filed in the united states was written in florida according the mortgage asset research institute a virginia based industry analyst but instead of more aggressive enforcement state regulators actually did less in fact the single most effective tool they had license revocations declined as the fraud rate soared records show

3832575 iraqs debts to kuwait are old and due must be paid a human kuwaiti people
3832576 the consequences of the debt iraq is the result of what he described as
3832577 of war with neighboring states like iran and kuwait and injustice loading iraqi people dire consequences
3832578 kuwait which provided funds to iraq during its war with iran also have to bear responsibility
3832579 kuwait can get through good relations at times the value of debt
3832580 iraq does not translate the world to write off its debts because iraqis believe that this debt is right because they were paid to the creditor nations know that oppressive and kill people
3832581 saudi arabia plummeted during the sharm el sheikh summit in egypt late last year on earlier pledges to write off 80 of the debts owed by iraq

3832587 the very first day we threw him in the water and you can tell if a guy can function at a base level right away he was functional now its a matter of all the stuff to build it but you have to at least athletically backpedal and move and transition and do all those things from day 1 he did that thats why i was encouraged now its a matter of developing him and getting confidence
3832588 we break up into scout teams this afternoon and were actually going to start putting in the hawaii game plan as we get going

3832653 i cant speak for big media journalists whove been in the game for years and years but from my experience with blogging for a few years i agree that pr as a profession is broken
3832654 what do you do if youre a startup looking for help in getting the word out about your company first off dont hire pr help until the volume of inbound requests by press are simply too much to handle without help thats way down the line for most companies
3832655 until then take the time to start reading blogs and other publications that cover what youre doing
3832656 suddenly you are no longer just a spectator with an agenda
3832657 and best of all you arent sucked into the web of politics and intrigue that guides the relationships between pr firms and the press you can build your own relationships and bypass all the mess
3832658 that is why the best product designers study the potential user customer and find out what their

3832660 jim youre absolutely right the really dangerous part of this line of thought is taking it to
3832661 not since 1976 when democrats last achieved a majority has a democrat won more than 38 of every 100 white male voters
3832662 many democrats explain their failures in a respect that reaffirms their self image the good fight for black equality caused a racially motivated southern flip
3832663 in the deep south that was true but nationally political white flight occurred in the south and the north it also reached its crescendo with ronald reagans election not during the peak of civil rights debates
3832664 however i would like to fight three times before the end of the year once next week for world victory road oct 3 for strikeforce and then on new years eve in japan
3832665 a man of words but not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds

3832667 we managed to escape to the shelter just in time
3832668 the georgians could not get tanks through these narrow streets so first they turned it to ruins with a grad attack and tried to punch through here to the centre of the city there was heavy fighting in the streets i think more than 500 bodies were pulled out of this part of town
3832669 i personally saw one man beheaded lying in the street and others say they witnessed civilians who had been finished off with a shot to the back of the head
3832670 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3832671 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by

3832677 confirms that the us has built an extensive arsenal of biological weapons in blatant violation of international laws and covenants
3832678 respected scientists on both sides of the atlantic warned that the us is illegally developing a new generation of weapons that undermine and possibly violate international treaties on biological and chemical warfare

3832681 the research proposed by the air force and navy raises serious legal questions under the 1989 us biological weapons anti terrorism act development of biological weapons including those that attack materials is subject to federal criminal and civil penalties

3832690 among our many initiatives we are continuing to develop more forward looking analyses to include red teaming efforts to understand new scientific trends that may be exploited by our adversaries to develop biological weapons and to help position intelligence collectors ahead of the problem
3832691 red teaming means that we actually have people out there on a red team plotting planning scheming and conspiring how to use biowarfare
3832692 impossible to distinguish between defensive and offensive research in the field
3832693 scores of us universities and biotechnology companies since 2001 have benefitted handsomely from billions of dollars in biodefense cash across the country biodefense labs are sprouting up like weeds the unrelenting spigot of federal money has thousands of scientists and technicians
3832694 sabotaged the verification protocol for the bwc and fully intend s to engage in research development and testing of illegal and criminal offensive biowarfare programs

3832715 you cant stand in the way of the will of the american people you cant do it you can try it for a day or two but its not going to last this is not a democrat or republican issue this is an american issue our energy security is being threatened if you look at whats going on over in russia now and whats going on in georgia two major pipelines going there and guess whos swinging in the balance the united states because 70 percent of our oil comes from overseas americans know that energy security is paramount to national security and if we want to feel more secure at home and help protect our economy and protect our way of life weve got to get on a path toward energy independence which is what americans want
3832716 of course you have memories of such a big tournament and losing
3832717 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
3832718 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
3832719 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3832720 but i was just making so many errors and i wasnt practicing like that at all it came to a point i think i hit a backhand in the net and i had just had enough
3832721 its only every four years so now is the time to really play well
3832722 its looking great for the americans the past couple of days
3832723 it would be great if we could finish up strong here and walk away with a few medals

3832740 this shift this transition is what obamas appealing to the older you are the more difficult it is to get out of the older school when things are changing that fast but for the baby boom generation all of a sudden you have someone who arrives on the scene who can be a validation of what youre waiting for and holy mackerel i believe obama is that person its that desire to believe to have that desire validated
3832741 some people say i was just carried away by the moment but i said shoot im going to endorse obama
3832742 the reason im a democrat is that i was fortunate enough to hear kennedy speak at his inauguration when i was 13

3832756 josh were in the midst of data analysis but i
3832757 interesting reactions can you share here or point me in the
3832758 judy although i dont think its limited to the former that
3832759 as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost
3832760 a ll motions for protective orders must be filed within 14 days of receipt or notice of such disputed discovery
3832761 plainly contemplate that a motion for protective relief including cost shifting is to be brought before the court in advance of the undue burden cost or expense from which protection is sought
3832762 of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible
3832763 construed and administered to secure the just speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding
3832764 the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit considering the needs of the case the amount in controversy the partys resources the importance of the issues at stake in the action and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues
3832765 simply put the parties are not at liberty to stipulate away their scheduling obligations and nothing in their stipulated order can be fairly read to do so
3832766 a court should consider cost shifting only when electronic data is relatively inaccessible such as in back up tapes
3832767 the individual defendants did not utilize any pdas in 2003 or 2004 the individual defendants did utilize computers provided by defendant skillpath seminars in 2003 and 2004 the network servers used by defendant skillpath seminars were searched for responsive documents
3832768 i f a request does not specify a form for producing esi a party must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms
3832769 a party need not produce the same esi in more than one form
3832770 option to produce in a reasonably usable form does not mean that a responding party is free to convert esi from the form in which it is ordinarily maintained to a different form that makes it more difficult or burdensome for the requesting party to use the information efficiently in the litigation
3832771 i f the responding party ordinarily maintains the information it is producing in a way that makes it searchable by electronic means the information should not be produced in a form that removes or significantly degrades this feature
3832772 knowledge concerning the storage preservation and backup of emails relating to claims authored or received by susan yeckley gilbert friedmann and alice barron as well as any other adjusters who handled plaintiffs claims
3832773 communicated with defendants via email from the beginning of this claim
3832774 knowledge of efforts undertaken by defendants and each of them to produce documents requested by plaintiffs in plaintiffs request for production of documents when responding to this matter exclude all attorney client information
3832775 a general refusal to cooperate in discovery is not enough a lawyer asserting a privilege must normally raise the privilege as to each record sought and each question asked so that the court can rule with specificity
3832776 submit to a forensic inspection of its computer systems which record its purchases and sales of square d products and its inventory of such products with such inspection to be incurred at globes sole expense and cost
3832777 the information at issue is important to the public health and safety in that the counterfeit circuit breakers represent a potential danger to unknowing consumers
3832778 to a set time and cost to avoid a fishing expedition
3832779 there is one server and two work stations that have any connection whatsoever with square d product
3832780 c onsidering globes long history of obstinate behavior in the discovery process and seeming lack of candor to the court on occasions the court refuses to accept its representation in this instance
3832781 mandating that globe electric allow any imaged and copied data to be removed from globe electrics premises by square d forensic consultant for further querying based on agreed upon search terms
3832782 yet perfect barrier now asks this court to force woodsmart to produce the electronic emails as static images with a bates number identifier
3832783 only requires woodsmart to submit the emails in the format in which it keeps them native format and nothing more
3832784 appropriate to ascertain the cost of forensic testing of the computers and server at issue to see if it justifies a forensic search of them
3832785 where the anticipated cost of doing the forensic search will dwarf the final recovery
3832786 that he has at this late stage not fully explained his actions provides an additional reason why the costs should not be shifted from him
3832787 indeed the court has little confidence that the discovery sought continues to exist
3832788 defendants behavior exemplifies the type of willful disregard for the process of discovery created by the federal rules of civil procedure that warrants the ultimate sanction of dismissal
3832789 may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced
3832790 w hen the data can as a practical matter be made usable by the discovering party only through respondents devices respondent may be required to use his devices to translate the data into usable form
3832791 is not meant to create a routine right of direct access to a partys electronic information system
3832792 information systems are designed to provide ready access to information used in regular and ongoing activities
3832793 i n many circumstances the requesting party should obtain and evaluate the information from such sources before insisting that the responding party search and produce information contained on sources that are not reasonably accessible
3832794 the requesting party has the burden of showing that its need for the discovery outweighs the burdens and costs of locating retrieving and producing the information
3832795 has notice that the evidence is relevant to litigation or should have known that the evidence may be relevant to future litigation
3832796 t hese orders were to protect against the defendants destruction of responsive information in light of the defendants persistent refusals to produce esi in violation of the courts orders
3832797 courts should guard against undue intrusiveness resulting from inspecting or testing electronic information systems
3832798 somewhere in the neighborhood of a pile 137 miles high
3832799 appreciable quantity of non duplicative documents and things responsive to the partys document request
3832800 whose paper and electronic files will be reviewed and produced in the first instance in response to the other parties initial document requests
3832801 in any event we certainly want to provide you with complete information and full cooperation
3832802 made it clear to counsel for amd and the class plaintiffs that it is prepared to share information regarding intels efforts in that regard and to work with them going forward in addressing the issues and minimizing any potential losses if any of information
3832803 spent many hours preparing roughly 400 pages of custodian specific retention reports which drew upon thousands of pages of attorney notes as well as other information
3832804 investigation has revealed no instance of deliberate deletion to deny amd access to any information responsive to the allegations in the complaint
3832805 notes of investigation interviews conducted by intels counsel concerning intels custodian employees compliance with their evidence preservation obligations
3832806 detail the preservation issues affecting each intel custodian including the nature scope and duration of any preservation issue s
3832807 detailed written description s of the preservation issues affecting every intel custodian including the nature scope and duration of any preservation issue s
3832808 a detailed written description of the information provided by each custodian to weil during the interviews
3832809 plaintiffs merely seek an efficient mechanism to get the whole story out without embarking on a world tour of costly preservation depositions
3832810 the google maps api key used on this web site was
3832811 i wanted the museum to be a vibrant space to display examples of work i had created over the decades and to stage events that would share my vision and skill for curating performance and spectacle
3832812 prees is a small village but the size of the development is huge its comparable to what would be proposed for a town
3832813 theres no provision for people to work theres no paid employment in prees at all and theres very little transport provision
3832814 we have got together in prees and formed an action group we are lobbying councillors various people owen paterson mp and the like
3832815 we do want local housing and we do want it for people who are already struggling and maybe want to get on to the property ladder
3832816 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
3832817 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
3832818 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
3832819 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
3832820 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
3832821 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
3832822 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
3832823 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
3832824 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
3832825 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
3832826 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
3832827 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
3832828 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
3832829 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
3832830 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
3832831 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
3832832 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
3832833 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
3832834 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
3832835 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
3832836 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
3832837 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
3832838 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
3832839 it is getting more and more precious now because there isnt anything else left everything else has been built on apart from the school its like a little park we just want to maintain it in its present state for the community
3832840 if we got village green status it would mean our last vestige of open space will be protected from development
3832841 the price of both diesel fuel and heating oil has been rising constantly over the previous months this has led to increases in the theft of diesel from commercial vehicles and heating oil from storage tanks outside homes
3832842 one example of this kind of behaviour took place at 11 10am yesterday when the driver of a blue skoda fabia filled up his tank and then made off without paying from harry tuffins petrol station in church stoke
3832843 in addition to the simple things such as not leaving keys in vehicles try to arrange property and car checks outside of working times
3832844 to support us we need companies to check their security arrangements and to improve them where necessary
3832845 if you have cctv systems ensure the exterior lighting is working to help enhance images and train a camera on any tanks or vehicles
3832846 completely meaningless unless it is known whether the date and time set on the computer were correct when the documents were created
3832847 they like just having someone with them to talk to sometimes its very important just to listen and its great to hear all their stories
3832848 a lot of them havent got anyone else to talk to no friends or family nearby and they get so upset when it gets to the end of the six weeks quite honestly a lot of these people should not be left on their own
3832849 you can learn a lot from them too ive heard some interesting stories like the chap who was telling me all the history of oakengates where all the shops used to be and where the old cinema was
3832850 im even taking someone to a wedding in an ambulance
3832851 we had one disabled lad who went home and his dad had fallen down the stairs had broken a number of bones and was quite seriously injured
3832852 the lad knew how to use the phone from the first aid training and could say
3832853 it was a lifeline it was like someone had dropped down something from above for me
3832854 i was like a prisoner in my own home and pauline took me shopping without her i could not have gone to the princess royal for my physio
3832855 often the practical help and emotional support they give enables someone to go home a little earlier and it certainly helps people to get back to their daily routines
3832856 i retired and ive always been active and ive done voluntary work all my life with the samaritans and the st johns after a while i needed something to do
3832857 really its a full time job its 20 hours a week for me and i could get a job and make some money
3832858 actually we should think about that but it keeps us busy
3832859 qu passa estic aqu no em veus tinc for a vaig amb el pit ben alt
3832860 our argument is that broseley has enough evidence for it to stand alone as a community
3832861 both much wenlock and broseley have very strong communities but they are both very different communities
3832862 everyone in broseley feels they have been over looked in the past for this to happen it would put back all the work we have done and would be like turning back the clock
3832863 we have obtained several thousand purse chains which are now available free of charge

3832866 electronic or handwritten daily activity records logs which are generally kept with an adjusters notes and telephone call records
3832867 t here were no daily activity logs or telephone record logs that were created or maintained in connection with plaintiffs claim

3832869 aimed at resolving the compliance issue and restoring some confidence in the discovery process
3832870 for the first phase of the pre production privilege review
3832871 due to the compressed schedule and time constraints in reviewing these tens of thousands of documents within the time permitted this review was undertaken by reviewing the page titles of the documents
3832872 whether search terms or keywords will yield the information sought is a complicated question involving the interplay at least of the sciences of computer technology statistics and linguistics
3832873 d etermining whether a particular search methodology such as keywords will or will not be effective certainly requires knowledge beyond the ken of a lay person and a lay lawyer
3832874 as to how it organized its search for relevant material or what steps it took to assure reasonable completeness and quality control
3832875 while key word searching is a recognized method to winnow relevant documents from large repositories
3832876 a lthough basic keyword searching techniques have been widely accepted both by courts and parties as sufficient to define the scope of their obligation to perform a search for responsive documents the experience of many litigators is that simple keyword searching alone is inadequate in at least some discovery contexts
3832877 i t is not surprising that lawyers and those to whom they delegate search tasks may not be particularly good at ferreting out responsive information through use of simple keyword search terms
3832878 had they not voluntarily abandoned their request for a court approved non waiver agreement they would have been protected from waiver
3832879 as noted by other district courts within the fourth circuit any order issued now by the court to attempt to redress these disclosures would be the equivalent of closing the barn door after the animals have already run away
3832880 however given the recurring problems associated with resolving disputed privilege protection claims during discovery it would be helpful to state the procedures that need to be followed in this process for the benefit of future cases
3832881 about which the parties and their attorneys often seem to be blissfully unconcerned

3832887 a health club discriminated against men by charging them more for membership than they charged women

3832889 even though i play baseball im still a baseball fan and still watch what everybody else is doing and read the papers for cubs fans and sox fans its fun to be here
3832890 i think the fact that the cubs have played to expectations while the cardinals have been ravaged by injuries and the fact that the brewers are a very talented but inconsistent team prone to streaks has really put the cubs where they are right now
3832891 thats better than where everybody thought wed be 25 games below 500

3832907 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption
3832908 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington
3832909 will be coming to atlanta on august 18 for a very special event at the marriott marquis downtown and i have agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team

3832918 she nearly lost her own life and that of her baby through delay and perhaps even the transfusion
3832919 although the patients previous record indicated that he had undergone surgery there were no scars to prove it
3832920 the result was a delay in transfusion and the patients life was placed at a significant and unnecessary risk
3832921 if i dont bring it to the attention of the communities that are doing these things they think they are being smart and getting away with it
3832922 but at the end of the day someones going to die and then theyre going to turn around and point their finger at the hospital
3832923 ive been forcing myself to eat and drink but it keeps coming up faster than its going down

3832926 when they came in i was told she told them to move out they didnt and she said they better move or she would get the cops on to them
3832927 they didnt know the boy they didnt know my son they just came off the street
3832928 we need information from the public particularly those who live in and around the house
3832929 we would also like to hear from anyone who may know who these offenders are or what the motive for the attack may be
3832930 i asked was it because johnny was up to no good and they said no he wasnt it sounds like a surprise to them with the men just walking in and doing that
3832931 i last saw him a couple of weeks ago he was into normal stuff he was a gentle boy
3832932 its what i think about every thursday when i tee it up
3832933 it when im asked and that has been every week since knost scored his second victory of the nationwide tour season in the price cutter charity championship presented by dr pepper in mid july
3832934 the minute you start forcing it trying to make it happen you begin getting further and further from it happening said lyle the tours leading money winner who has been on the performance promotion hunt since mid june
3832935 the hard part is you know youre close that all it takes is one more good week
3832936 if i win i win but i know where im going next year said knost currently fifth on the 2007 money list with 259 308 more than enough to guarantee his graduation to golfs highest level
3832937 but i wouldnt mind getting up there and seeing what some of those courses on the fall finish are like
3832938 but ive always been taught that i need to win two battles each week he said
3832939 thats me against myself and me against the golf course i try to play each hole as best i can if i get it right everything will take care of itself
3832940 i really wouldnt be surprised if we both dont get into contention here knost said tuesday afternoon after getting his first look at irondequoit
3832941 thats why im looking forward to the next three or four weeks said lyle who didnt touch a golf club until friday of last week choosing to spend the majority of his time planted on the couch sipping a few adult beverages while catching up on the olympic games
3832942 my iron play is solid and im driving it awesome its just a matter of getting a few more putts in the hole then watch out
3832943 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3832944 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3832945 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3832946 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3832947 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3832948 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3832949 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3832950 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3832951 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3832952 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3832953 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3832954 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3832955 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3832956 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3832957 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3832958 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3832959 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3832960 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3832961 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3832962 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3832963 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3832964 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3832965 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3832966 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3832967 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3832968 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3832969 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3832970 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3832971 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3832972 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3832973 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3832974 in view of the many incidents we call on the international olympic committee to intercede on behalf of the chinese citizens who are in danger because of the position they have taken during the olympic games
3832975 it is the duty of the olympic movement in its entirety to ensure respect for the spirit of the olympic truce
3832976 since the origins of the olympics tradition has required that peace should prevail during the games
3832977 during the truce period the athletes artists and their families as well as ordinary pilgrims could travel in total safety to participate in or attend the olympic games and return afterwards to their respective countries the international olympic committee ioc decided to revive the ancient concept of the olympic truce with the view to encourage searching for peaceful and diplomatic solutions to the conflicts around the world
3832978 this was an assault in my mind i am incredibly angry about this
3832979 they dont stop following me filming me and photographing me
3832980 i think twice before interviewing chinese about sensitive issues for fear that they could be arrested
3832981 the same thing happened with the pastor of an unrecognised church
3832982 whats more the official media have not stopped attacking us since last marchs events in tibet in addition to the death threats received by dozens of foreign journalists the chinese media try to undermine our credibility and all of this gained pace in the run up to the games

3833001 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3833002 healthcare in america is broken sure but how did it get that way

3833021 this means if our gas production remains at the level of last year bapex will earn tk 37 crore this year last year bapex earned just tk 13 crore by selling 536 million cubic feet of gas
3833022 it will take at least three years before bapex can show some good results we have financially starved for long you cannot expect immediate results after announcing a big budget we need time to prepare ourselves
3833023 its true the old vehicles have returned to the city we also have taken some measures to take action against it and announced an awarding system
3833024 if any traffic sergeant catches any such vehicle hell be awarded tk 1 000

3833027 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad

3833030 additional gas will be supplied to the industrial units that could not go into operation for want of gas
3833031 as a short term solution to power crisis we have decided to set up a furnace oil run rental power plant
3833032 though we know it will be a bit expensive we have to look for an alternative way of producing power as an instant solution
3833033 talks with board of investment boi and others concerned are going on
3833034 since its a huge project all the details need to be discussed thoroughly

3833048 as of today 17 to 18 persons in written statements have wanted to make voluntary disclosure of their corruption before the commission
3833049 these persons however have not yet taken the official forms to be filled in for the commissions consideration we hope to begin the official procedure once they submit the forms
3833050 once a person appears before the commission for voluntary disclosure of their corruption investigations conducted by other government agencies will be stopped
3833051 we have decided not to bring such persons to the dock so that no one feels humiliated we will not do anything that affects their image
3833052 the matter of making voluntary disclosure will however be officially informed to the departments of the absolution seekers

3833063 if you were to run out on the harbour bridge in rush hour you could have someone go into the back of you theres also the inconvenience factor because you have to get someone to bring petrol out to you
3833064 its a very false economy and in some cases you actually increase your costs
3833065 while we understand that filling up with higher petrol prices is hurting peoples wallets it is a false economy not to do so
3833066 the lower you run your petrol the more damage you are doing to the tank
3833067 it lets the pump run dry and that will do some damage to it
3833068 the brushes within the pump can spark its a very long shot but there have been instances when its happened
3833069 the fact is you are using the petrol anyway you would be better filling up the tank than going every time and just putting 20 in
3833070 i think its probably more expensive because theres more weight
3833071 i put in 20 yesterday just so i could make it to the petrol station today and use my fuel dockets to fill it right up

3833098 its not always easy but i have to maintain a sense of humor about this
3833099 even when i wonder when ill get to a point when im going to break
3833100 if you dont have a structure some of these things could get worse
3833101 this is the line to register as a sex offender
3833102 arent you going to guess where i got the money
3833103 we advise you to contact google and try to find out exactly which pages were listed and what the badware was
3833104 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3833105 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3833106 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3833107 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3833108 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3833109 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3833110 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3833111 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3833112 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
3833113 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3833114 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3833115 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3833116 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
3833117 given that fannie mae and freddie mac are solely involved in housing thats their sole business and given the magnitude of the housing correction weve had its not a surprise to me to see those losses
3833118 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor here in treasury
3833119 i believe its going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all the housing problems
3833120 the period of turmoil that were going through in our capital markets today is different from some of the periods weve had in the past in that the root cause took place right in the united states of america
3833121 long term economic fundamentals of the united states compare very favourably
3833122 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3833123 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3833124 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3833125 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3833126 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3833127 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3833128 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3833129 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3833130 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3833131 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3833132 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3833133 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3833134 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3833135 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3833136 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events
3833137 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3833138 the han and the ethnic minorities including the uighurs are equal members of the big family in china and they are all chinese citizens who enjoy the rights and freedoms allowed them by law
3833139 were looking at all the possibilities not just that theory
3833140 im not sure they want to i know that one friend i dont know if shes decided to press charges or if shes still avoiding that
3833141 but i never saw anyone else like family or kids
3833142 were just glad we were able to get to them
3833143 the number looks disturbingly bullish but well probably see some rebound in gasoline supplies next week now that refineries are back online after the storm
3833144 weve got a good sized really going here today but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3833145 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3833146 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3833147 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3833148 is this somehow like the child who kills his parents and then complains about being an orphan
3833149 he has two options to stay and fight or quit and go home
3833150 if he fights back we are with him we will support him and that is the preferred option
3833151 using that power would be undemocratic under the present circumstances even though it is in the constitution the democratic process should continue
3833152 we have the numbers and you have already seen the tidal wave against him musharraf in the provinces
3833153 thing of the hamas leader calls for an end of israels
3833154 moses wandered for 40 years and since king weve been lost and kind of wandering without direction for 40 years
3833155 my generation went through turbulent times in the 1960s that completely inverted the system we had grown up with im so proud of us i could pop we have been the generation in which the gate has swung 180 degrees my generation and doggone it im proud of what weve done
3833156 this shift this transition is what obamas appealing to the older you are the more difficult it is to get out of the older school when things are changing that fast but for the baby boom generation all of a sudden you have someone who arrives on the scene who can be a validation of what youre waiting for and holy mackerel i believe obama is that person its that desire to believe to have that desire validated
3833157 some people say i was just carried away by the moment but i said shoot im going to endorse obama
3833158 the reason im a democrat is that i was fortunate enough to hear kennedy speak at his inauguration when i was 13
3833159 he challenged us to go to the moon he didnt say how we were going to do it he said we need to go and god damn we did thats the beauty of someone with the ability to inspire
3833160 is very sensitive to not trying to alienate any of his republican support
3833161 im the dude playing a dude disguised as another dude
3833162 i find it laughable watchdog groups would go this route considering sen mccain chaired the senate indian affairs committee that investigated jack abramoff i suggest they take a closer look at barack obamas friends like convicted felon tony rezko or his national co chairman harry reid who took nearly 68 000 from abramoff
3833163 well mccain may be corrupt but so are the other guys so nyah
3833164 reeds hypocrisy is legion now matched only by john mccains attending a fundraiser hes helping host
3833165 the remaining residents of these destroyed ethnic georgian villages are facing desperate conditions with no means of survival no help no protection and nowhere to go
3833166 every gross brained idiot is suffered to come into print
3833167 women do not find it difficult nowadays to behave like men but they often find it extremely difficult to behave like gentlemen

3833173 looked at over a longer timeframe from 1970 to 1981 the price of gold rose 1 219 percent versus a rise in the price of oil 1 291 percent
3833174 in 1970 an ounce of gold 35 would buy 15 barrels opec oil 2 30 bbl in may 1981 an ounce of gold 480 still bought 15 barrels of saudi oil 32 bbl
3833175 oh no that gold has got to be much deeper and that sheer is just all wrong

3833236 i thought we got some great work in today i thought both sides were very professional in their approach we have a little different schemes on both sides of the ball and it was good work for dallas and obviously the broncos we have a practice this afternoon and im looking forward to that
3833237 they have a different type of offense and a different type of defense we get a chance to work against a 3 4 look and they get a chance to take a look at a four man front i thought it was good for both teams it was a very healthy practice and there was some good fresh hitting you go against somebody where you dont know their tendencies so everybody plays a little bit more honest and its a good evaluation process for us
3833238 what you want to do when youre taking a look at your otas when youre taking a look at your summer camp you want to find your best 53 guys that can play you want to get better as a scheme offensively defensively and special teams this is a little bit different here normally that third week of practice you get tired of hitting against each other this is a good changeup for both teams where you get a chance to go against different schemes and different people i thought it was good for both squads
3833239 normally the first couple of weeks of training camp you want to install your offense and defense to go against a team too early would kind of take away what you are trying to put in as your basic fundamentals to installing your offense defense and special teams usually its better before your second preseason game because you have all of that installation in you have a preseason game under your belt you know who you want to evaluate and you get a chance to do it against different people
3833240 you change it up we went there last year obviously they are playing at our facility so they are going to come here we will probably do the same thing next year if we play the cowboys in preseason
3833241 we brought in a couple of corners poole and cb wale dada that we thought would give us more depth at that position guys that we feel have more of a chance to make our football team sometimes you make changes after a game based on how they play we didnt feel like either of those players cb lamont reid and cb christian morton could make our football team so we went in a different direction and brought some guys in that we thought could compete for possibly making our squad
3833242 he has been playing with the first team and second team throughout camp we have some competition there at middle linebacker and we will find out at the end of camp who steps up and who is our starter we have two guys koutouvides and lb nate webster that are practicing extremely well and we want to give both guys a chance to practice and play with the first team unit part of the evaluation process is how they play in practice and how thy play here in the games so we will have a chance to do both
3833243 i dont know if he picks his play up any more brandon has been doing this throughout camp i think you get a chance to see him against different people and obviously a very good football team in the cowboys its always nice to see a guy step up and make some plays like he did
3833244 naturally it does players and coaches you want to perform in front of your peers you want to practice well you want to play well and at the same time we want to evaluate a lot of people we have a chance to do it all today
3833245 to be honest with you they take advantage of an opportunity rb selvin young was obviously injured at texas but he came in here stayed healthy and took advantage of an opportunity any time you get a scholarship and are averaging about five and a half to six yards per carry at texas you know you have a big upside and he is taking advantage of that opportunity here

3833485 is a fetus a human being at every stage of its development that is from conception onward is it to be regarded as human life from the very beginning
3833486 thou knowest when i sit down and when i rise up
3833487 let only darkness cover me and the light about me be night
3833488 whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence
3833489 for thou didst form my inward parts thou didst knit me together in my mothers womb
3833490 i praise thee for thou art fearful and wonderful wonderful are thy works thou knowest me right well my frame was not hidden from thee when i was made in secret
3833491 in thy book were written every one of them the days that were formed for me when as yet there was none of them how precious to me are thy thoughts o god

3833506 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3833507 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax

3833519 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3833520 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional cease fire

3833523 ironically we came through security at the same time we were thankful to be here and to be able to race
3833524 we really spent the last three days making sure that we were focused within ourselves not being afraid of failure and not letting that fear get in the way of having a good race
3833525 because the fear and the nerves can get to you and overcome your sense of ease that makes you row a lot better we just went out there trying to be focused and be loose
3833526 we just went through that over and over and over
3833527 we have a lot of confidence in our crew and we know from previous races this summer that we continually progress throughout the racing we seem to get better and better

3833591 there was an important national meeting in january that ushered in a new leadership for the china christian council a switch has been made to a younger generation of leaders
3833592 we read a lot in the press about the difficulties of christians in china a house church leader was arrested in beijing the olympics have been a high security event for china the picture is not a perfect one but the tendency in the western media is to accentuate the problems the house church leader who was detained was on his way to a church in beijing there are charges that the people attending that church are all government agents but i know that church theyre there to worship jesus christ
3833593 there are places in china particularly in inland china where the local government leaders are not following the national policies so there are abuses of religious freedom
3833594 by recent estimates five to seven new churches are opening every day all kinds of churches
3833595 amity press has printed more than 50 million bibles ninety percent of these have been distributed all over china they
3833596 the bible is not sold in public book stores a policy i dont believe is helpful but its available in churches and in private book stores
3833597 bishop ting presided over the most extraordinary time in the chinese church in the 20th century he helped recreate institutions developed theological education printed bibles and religious literature he did so by cooperation not confrontation
3833598 china aid and others think the only way the church can exist in china is to confront the government
3833599 bishop ting is one of the greatest church leaders of the 20th century he had an enormous impact on the life of the church
3833600 you always see these numbers thrown around 150 million christians
3833601 based on provincial figures but these figures are typically underestimated and include church attendance rolls and other things a reasonable number for protestants in china is 30 million to 40 million i cant see much more than that
3833602 i understand that there is a very large network of christians not affiliated with the ccc they would not be listed in the official figures and there are other groups many observers would give you the total number of christians as 30 million to 40 million as i have the largest number i have heard from credible sources is 60 million to 70 million
3833603 there are all kinds of shades of grey here rather than black and white
3833604 after the 1917 revolution the russian government saw the church as one of its main enemies the orthodox church had extensive land holdings etc in china christians never had such a huge presence
3833605 christianity in china was not then and is not now as highly institutionalized as in russia the clearest case for reconciliation such as that happening between the disparate baptist groups in russia is among the chinese catholics the vatican has treaded very lightly on this that will resolve itself once china and the vatican normalize relations
3833606 but its much more important to get back to the question of leadership the new generation has the potential to do something their elders didnt have opportunity to do they have a long term view
3833607 modo on fire but dont get too excited it turns out hes just speaking metaphorically her latest column which as martin can tell you is
3833608 it is mere rashness to seek death but it is cowardly to refuse it
3833609 to pray for the other publicly as a post soviet evangelical church is therefore an important step on what must still be a long road toward reconciliation given the many many negatives that have circulated
3833610 and we believe we will be able to find contact with one another and continue our dialogue
3833611 no great theological chasm exists between registered churches and unregistered churches many chinese christians attend both
3833612 however there is a difference between registered and unregistered churches in political attitude
3833613 for the lords sake accept the authority of every human institution
3833614 the political attitude of the unregistered churches reflects the theology of the book of revelation they assume that the chinese government being communist in ideology is pagan and satanic most unregistered churches do not believe that christianity should collaborate with a government that does not love or honor god
3833615 with bible printing and devotional and theological books coming off the presses chinas christians are in the most hopeful and open society they have known in centuries they have limited freedoms but are doing much more with their adjusted freedoms than many other places are
3833616 chose to ignore local and national leadership and began covert work
3833617 so they and some others chose cloak and dagger secret christian witness in china which is absolutely unnecessary christianity is one of five officially recognized religions in china
3833618 where the sbc foreign mission board failed was early on in 1984 when they promised to work with the ccc and be there to help in any way they could
3833619 went that way without informing me i was viewed as too close to the ccc national leadership and not trusted as a covert agent
3833620 k h bishop ting told me what they were doing and asked me to do something our leadership was surprised that k h knew and were not happy with me
3833621 they wanted us to go and we did i see it as another element of the fundamentalist takeover of the sbc
3833622 i am told that those sent to unreached peoples particularly to countries where missionaries are not admitted or not welcomed sometimes misrepresent themselves as specialists who have no relation to mission boards though in fact they have been sent and are supported by mission boards
3833623 this is the kind of dishonesty which cannot be squared with christian ethics
3833624 such practices cannot be condoned to assume that one has to forsake truth to have access to people where missionaries are not admitted is not only shoddy ethics but also poor theology
3833625 the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church
3833626 in such a vast and populous country the tolerance for religious practice varies greatly
3833627 but you can never count on that being permanent its a cat and mouse game and its dangerous
3833628 an agent of the government house church leaders do not regard the tspm and the china christian council ccc as authentic representatives of the chinese church hence it is hard for them to be reconciled with their betrayers who are still betraying them
3833629 the tspm recently asked the public security bureau to shut down all house church meetings and arrest house church leaders and traveling evangelists
3833630 bishop ding also started a theological reconstruction campaign among the official seminaries the purpose is to change the focus of teaching from justification by faith alone in jesus christ to justification by love in doing good deeds under the guidance of tspm and the state administration of religious affairs sara religious messages are to be made compatible with socialism pastors are discouraged from preaching about jesus divinity miracles or resurrection so that believers and non believers can be united together to build a prosperous socialist china
3833631 all of it is lies k h is not that kind of man
3833632 pleading for the government to spare the students and not do anything rash
3833633 because bike zhang met the americans and destroyed the harmony of the beijing olympic games
3833634 bishop ting now a very old man went along with the three self policy in china when mao first promoted it in the late 1950s
3833635 the worst was yet to come the cultural revolution swept aside those who compromised just as it did those who refused to compromise the parallel with stalin and the russian orthodox church in 1929 is uncanny so ever so slowly the three self movement and the new unregistered churches emerged in the late 1970s it was the latter who now showed unbelievable fortitude in the face of continuing persecution the number of new converts justifying the stand they had taken but the three self churches made progress too less spectacular perhaps but progress nevertheless
3833636 the position with the roman catholic church is more clear cut the government controlled church which has had to cut its ties with the vatican does not have the moral authority found with the persecuted church whose bishops the vatican appoints cardinal zen in hong kong stands firmly behind the latter a thorn in the flesh for the beijing authorities
3833637 comparison with former soviet union is very tenuous after the 1917 revolution the russian government saw the church as one of its main enemies the orthodox church had extensive land holdings etc in china christians never had such a huge presence christianity in china was not then and is not now as highly institutionalized as in russia
3833638 there are places in china particulary in inland china where the local government leaders are not following the national policies so there are abuses of religious freedom but the tendency in the western media is to accentuate the problems china aid and others think the only way the church can exist in china is to confront the government
3833639 bishop ting presided over the most extraordinary time in the chinese church in the 20th century he helped recreate institutions developed theological education printed bibles and religious literature he did so by cooperation not confrontation

3833665 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3833666 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3833667 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3833668 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3833669 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3833670 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3833671 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3833710 em um texto que segundo creio da gaia ci ncia em que fala de schopenhauer reprovando lhe sua an lise da religi o nietzsche diz que schopenhauer cometeu o erro de procurar a origem ursprung da religi o em um sentimento metaf sico que estaria presente em todos os homens e conteria por antecipa o o n cleo de toda religi o seu modelo ao mesmo tempo verdadeiro e essencial nietzsche afirma eis uma an lise da hist ria da religi o que totalmente falsa pois admitir que a religi o tem origem em um sentimento metaf sico significa pura e simplesmente que a religi o j estava dada ao menos em estado impl cito envolta nesse sentimento metaf sico ora diz nietzsche a hist ria n o isso n o dessa maneira que se faz hist ria n o dessa maneira que as coisas se passaram pois a religi o n o tem origem n o tem ursprung ela foi inventada houve uma eifindung da religi o em um dado momento algo aconteceu que fez aparecer a religi o a religi o foi fabricada ela n o existia anteriormente entre a grande continuidade da ursprung descrita por schopenhauer e a ruptura que caracteriza a de nietzsche h uma oposi o fundamental
3833711 existe ainda a famosa passagem no final do primeiro discurso de a genealogia da moral em que nietzsche se refere a essa esp cie de grande f brica de grande usina em que se produz o ideal o ideal n o tem origem ele tamb m foi inventado fabricado produzido por uma s rie de mecanismos de pequenos mecanismos a inven o erfindung para nietzsche por um lado uma ruptura por outro algo que possui um pequeno come o baixo mesquinho inconfess vel este o ponto crucial da erflndung foi por obscuras rela es de poder que a poesia foi inventada foi igualmente por puras obscuras rela es de poder que a religi o foi inventada vilania portanto de todos estes come os quando s o opostos solenidade da origem tal como vista pelos fil sofos
3833712 n o h no fundo segundo nietzsche nenhuma semelhan a nenhuma afinidade pr via entre conhecimento e essas coisas que seria necess rio conhecer em termos mais rigorosamente kantianos seria necess rio dizer que as condi es de experi ncia e as condi es do objeto de experi ncia s o totalmente heterog neas
3833713 se quisermos realmente conhecer o conhecimento saber o que ele apreend lo em sua raiz em sua fabrica o devemos nos aproximar n o dos fil sofos mas dos pol ticos devemos compreender quais s o as rela es de luta e de poder e somente nessas rela es de luta e de poder na maneira como as coisas entre si os homens entre si se odeiam lutam procuram dominar uns aos outros querem exercer uns sobre os outros rela es de poder que compreendemos em que consiste o conhecimento

3833735 the new directives are aimed at creating a serious obstacle for the day to day operations of the fleet and contradict the 1997 agreements between russia and ukraine on the status and terms of the russian black sea fleets presence on ukrainian territory
3833736 this unilateral step delivers another blow to talks on the issue of the black sea fleet as well as the whole range of bilateral relations
3833737 russia regards the ukrainian leaders actions as contradicting the spirit and letter of the named agreements and the 1997 agreement on friendship cooperation and partnership between the russian federation and ukraine

3833754 some footage had been produced before the opening ceremony to provide theatrical effect
3833755 some of them were genuinely produced some maybe were used from previously recorded material

3833759 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence
3833760 if they want to do it and they are talented enough i would support them but theyd have to express an interest on their own
3833761 id rather they didnt pursue it but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3833762 apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score most of the ambient music throughout it
3833763 no one in the radiohead organisation is aware of the band composing any original incidental or ambient music for choke
3833764 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3833765 we do believe that broadening our assortment and having iphone in our stores is certainly going to be very important

3833770 the show is a different maid in a different manhattan she lopez will be very integral in the pilot and series

3833772 i think the current conflict has moved us away from the map plan moving forward wouldnt be a great idea
3833773 it makes you ask about georgias motives for joining nato
3833774 if you could prove beforehand that had nato extended the map nothing would have happened then sure that looks like an obviously good outcome
3833775 it certainly would have raised the stakes of intervention in russias mind
3833776 the russians could easily have said with the map in place well call the u
3833777 when your credibility is on the line its a very dangerous situation having these bluffs called
3833778 russians think if we attack then that country is automatically excluded from western institutions like nato
3833779 a country thats under occupation with its territory severed and its capital on fire is not a nato country its is not an eu country
3833780 through its actions russia is sending a message not just to georgia but to ukraine
3833781 francis stated that he planned on exposing how exactly mr wynn deceives his high end customers with reckless disregard for the truth

3833792 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption
3833793 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington

3833801 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3833802 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3833803 the car was clearly marked they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in humanitarian community in afghanistan
3833804 since they oppose the current government they also oppose those who work with it
3833805 and unfortunately they dont differentiate among armed multinational forces security contractors and humanitarian groups
3833806 the irc provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3833807 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3833808 i dont know how political it was i had a high profile case
3833809 i went through all the training i served honorably in my unit i used army provisions to try become a noncombatant and remain in the army as a medic or something but i still would be subject to going on combat missions as a medic

3833811 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3833812 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis

3833814 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project

3833818 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3833819 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3833820 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbor country its not a good idea

3833825 one of the early ways our users started to use dipity was to aggregate a lot of their social media content into one place pulling their blog posts their flickr photo streams their tweets from twitter stuff like that

3833856 a georgian military plant in which israeli experts are upgrading jet fighters for the georgian military russian fighter jets bombed runways inside the plant located near tbilisi where israeli security firm elbit is in charge of upgrading georgian su 25 jets
3833857 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
3833858 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military
3833859 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran

3833869 there is a deepening split between the traditional nixonian realist wing of the republican party and the neo conservatives that has become more pronounced with john mccains hardline anti russia rhetoric
3833870 i have good reason to believe that there will be other republicans such as james baker the former secretary of state who may withhold endorsement from mccain rather than endorse obama directly

3833875 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3833876 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3833877 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3833878 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3833879 this commonly cited gym clich is somewhat misunderstood and misused the rationale that muscle weighs more than fat is often cited as an explanation for why a person might find that they arent losing weight or are gaining weight when they kick off an exercise regimen the idea seems to be that if you are exercising and theoretically losing fat and gaining muscle at the same time the effects cancel each other out so in theory you wont see desired weight loss as measured by pounds on the scale even though you may be improving how you look you certainly can improve your appearance with exercise without always seeing a change in your body weight by becoming firmer more sculpted and sometimes leaner but that doesnt mean that you are gaining massive amounts of muscle or losing lots of fat
3833880 you can gain muscle or lose weight and you can gain or lose more body fat but they dont convert into each other both gaining and losing muscle and or fat can both affect your body weight on the scale depending upon the magnitude of the body fat or body muscle increase or decrease
3833881 weight loss boils down to burning more calories than you normally use in a day cardio exercise burns more calories than muscle toning or the average resistance training workout so dialing down the stretching and core work to just once or twice a week and replacing it with more cardio should produce more weight loss and the more minutes the better when it comes to weight loss an hour to 90 minutes of aerobic activity per day on most days of the week will affect body weight

3833995 a great burden having that pale skin i just remembered having custard blisters on the chest and bright red shoulders in summer
3833996 the first thing they say is oh what lovely hair
3833997 its constantly in the back of my mind that people might mention it
3833998 they make jokes unconsciously and dont even notice after theyve done it
3833999 they pick on gingers more than anyone else and its just because were different
3834000 though i dont think they really know that if you think about it its just the same as racism when i say that though people say its not racist its hairist
3834001 thered have been hell to pay people say its only a joke but if youre 13 and you get it every single day put it another way its like girls coming home from school and being verbally abused by big hairy blokes in vans the websites light its done on a humorous level but we do get people contacting us who are seriously struggling particularly between the ages of 13 and 14 if youre a shy retiring type and dont want attention its pretty hard to just get on with it
3834002 if they are confident lads they will deal with it in a comical way if someone says something about your hair you find something about them they are not going to be perfect
3834003 your grandmothers attitude to us was its a plus youre lucky because not many people have got it presumably because theres so much going the other way it was a bit like kids who are adopted and their parents say youre special we chose you but it worked for me

3834043 it has produced some good work in the past but this is a very bad report sometimes they come up with good ideas and sometimes they come up with bad ideas this is a bad one
3834044 i think there is a resurgence going on in britains northern cities
3834045 conservative party policy will continue the good work of regenerating cities right across england including northern cities
3834046 to state that northern cities like bradford liverpool and my home town of hull have no hope of being regenerated in the 21st century and that people should move to london oxford and cambridge is the most insulting and ignorant policy ive ever heard
3834047 if the mekons at this tory thinktank had even bothered to go north of watford theyd discover that these very towns that they want to give up on have experienced a remarkable renaissance under labour
3834048 it would be easy to dismiss this as the work of a bunch of wonkers but its quite clear that
3834049 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3834050 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3834051 sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3834052 cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london
3834053 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position
3834054 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3834055 this report from david camerons favourite thinktank has just dismissed a huge area of the country as worthless is it any wonder there are no tory councillors in liverpool when for all their warm words they have not changed a bit

3834073 many appreciate what a 24 hour downtown convenience store brings but there are also concerns about the element that has been attracted to the stores
3834074 but it is my hope that were turning a new leaf here and that the relationship between doug peterson and the downtown public safety community will improve
3834075 id just like to thank commissioners for their faith that i can do this and i will do this and their faith in small business
3834076 i fail to see why a disgusting store such as petersons is able to stay open it caters to the dregs of society
3834077 i certainly hope that that does not reflect the official corporate policy of brooks brothers
3834078 and i would remind the person who sent that email that the so called dregs of the city include homeless veterans and i think it is a sad day when we use disparaging language about people who through no fault of their own are homeless on the streets of portland
3834079 i had that fantasy of adding on but over time i realized that we could live comfortably in a small three bedroom house we just needed it to open up
3834080 i wanted that wall out no matter what we had to do
3834081 i would have take a sledgehammer to it myself if it had been up any longer
3834082 rather than have a big house with formal rooms we prefer a smaller home that is truly lived in
3834083 chris and i live by the mantra that a practical house is one in which you touch every surface every day
3834084 with five of us and a dog in a small space we definitely do
3834085 they make the house seem much larger and really integrate the yard into the house
3834086 ive added more of a cottage feel to the house even though its a ranch
3834087 i think the fact that im not a purist and i made decisions intuitively is why the house came out fun and different
3834088 when you use colors that are too neutral they get washed out by the bright sun

3834158 consumers are under pressure from job losses declines in wages after the effects of inflation and lower household wealth resulting from weakness in equity prices and declines in home prices

3834193 the movement overall also suffers from a complete misunderstanding of both gods motivation in choosing abraham and his sovereignty in choosing the time when the eternal word would become incarnate the choosing of the jews had far less to do with gods preference for hebrew as it did with his rewarding the faith of abraham
3834194 the greek language is highly suited for philosophical endeavors whereas biblical hebrew was relatively simple by comparison i do not believe it was a coincidence that god chose a time when the infrastructure language and culture of an empire allowed an easy expansion of the faith the widespread use of a language that allowed its forceful defense and a rich culture that allowed it to be placed in the context of the fulfillment of all that is good within mankind

3834406 we are partnering with companies who like us believe that we must take the lead in providing better nursing care
3834407 these partnerships will help us to educate more and better nurses to serve the region
3834408 we are grateful to our generous supporters for their contributions in this undertaking as we work together in the pacific to bring about a better and healthier world
3834409 every participating pacific college and university recognizes the need for more trained nurses to serve the islanders
3834410 this is indeed a superb opportunity for the northern pacific nursing educational programs academic institutions educational health and nursing leaders to work together more closely and effectively
3834411 it represents a key opportunity to link collaborative efforts at strengthening nursing education and practice within the who western pacific region
3834412 each new nurse that our pacific schools can prepare for the many health challenges confronting our pacific island citizens will help change the world a little bit at a time if we set our minds to working cooperatively and within a neighborly approach we can bring about a team of quality nurses to the pacific
3834413 this grant by the robert wood johnson foundation to the friends of the college of the marshall islands is an indication that the college of the marshall islands can serve as a vehicle for regional advancement
3834414 this nursing faculty development effort addresses the health educational needs of the rmi and its neighboring countries as well
3834415 this grant will also provide support to provide a stable adequate nursing workforce for the rmi one of the colleges charter responsibilities
3834416 this project will establish and strengthen relationships among practicing nurses and nursing educational providers
3834417 it will bring together the american pacific nurse leaders council the who and others to strengthen the faculty of the nursing education programs within the u s affiliated pacific island jurisdictions
3834418 the result of such a collaborative approach between pacific nations will have a ripple effect where innovative ideas are tested locally and shared internationally
3834419 the robert wood johnson foundation grant will allow the practicing nursing professionals as well as the nursing education faculty to develop strategies for resource sharing among not only our nursing programs but also among hospitals public health departments and other regional health providers
3834420 not having enough nurses affects the quality of care that patients receive here in majuro and throughout the rmi
3834421 we are pleased that the friends of the college of the marshall islands foundation was selected to help identify solutions which will result in more nurses being trained for the citizens of the marshall islands we look forward to helping the citizens of the republic through strengthening our partnering with the nursing department at cmi
3834422 as the severity of the nursing shortage continues to grow the stability and quality of health care stands at risk
3834423 it is not only a local problem but a local issue that demands community based interventions and innovative solutions this unique pacific partnership of organizations helps foster innovations that will drive nursing workforce solutions beyond what any one foundation could do alone
3834424 the awarding of the grant will help the nursing department of our nations college with curricula in leadership collaboration and innovation and will provide an opportunity for all of our nursing professionals to benefit from the mentoring and exchange of what works with our neighboring nations
3834425 these funds will definitely help us to strengthen our joint investments in nursing projects by increasing health collaborations between cmi and the ministry of health

3834487 its interesting you know theyre both the same age theyre both monster superstars cultural myths almost from the 1980s into the 1990s but in so many ways theyre hard to compare
3834488 one could argue that as a musician a dancer and an entertainer michael jackson has it all over madonna by a factor of 10
3834489 it didnt sell as well as her music did a few years ago but it was a number one album and if anyone has ever proven that shes able of reinventing herself thats madonna
3834490 madonna has managed to stay creative and to stay relevant i think she still is in the popular music scene
3834491 i dont know what shell be like at 60 but
3834492 theres no shrewder businesswoman she could probably run a music studio
3834493 he got to the point that he was so rich so powerful and so famous that he was allowed to kind of withdraw from any kind of reality
3834494 he accidentally turned himself into a parody of himself and then its kind of hard to re emerge as a serious performer
3834495 i dont think its impossible i think hes still got talent but then you tie that in with the trial and that made an awful lot of people terribly uncomfortable
3834496 jackson withstood a trial which was very ugly and was vindicated the idea that he could be a paedophile having that in the news is not going to make your career any good

3834498 there is no question that the clock of the nations is a true community treasure and a significant part of rochesters history
3834499 i am thrilled that we have been able to restore the clock and ensure that it will stay in our community for years to come even more importantly i am proud that the clock will eventually be donated to the golisano childrens hospital where it will be enjoyed by kids their families and visitors

3834507 thats how nano 2007 felt like a birth with the fetus being a seventy five page labor of willpower and plain old brooklyn stubbornness
3834508 the fantastic thing about willpower is that you dont know what it will accomplish before you set down to a task amassing your will is a surprising process usually fraught with procrastination aggravation and a number of other ations that i need not go into needless to say it comes out of nowhere swallowing your time and energy and the byproduct is usually something amazing or wonderful thats how nano 2007 felt like a birth with the fetus being a seventy five page labor of willpower and plain old brooklyn stubbornness when nano came about in 2007 i was on the brink of bankruptcy as a college student i simply hadnt had the time or the luck to find a job that would accommodate going to classes and making enough to survive i managed to skate through thanks to the loving help of my family but after a string of no go jobs i was trapped i was taking fifteen credits in college racing to the finish line of a bachelors degree and i was fully sure i would never be able to survive the hole my finances had become in my mind everything was hopeless after all why go to all the trouble of getting a degree in film when everyone knew that only big name people in hollywood made money in film and money was what i needed what was the point of a degree if i couldnt pay my bills what was the purpose of being creative then if you couldnt put money towards credit card bills when necessary i was trapped and sinking fast a job came out of nowhere in the last few days of october it was a daunting retail position probably the most challenging of my life and it paid enough to get my life on track the trouble was that it meant juggling nearly thirty five hours of work a week with fifteen credits in college plus any sort of social engagements as i was just starting the position a new co worker reminded me that nano was coming up i was sure there was no chance i would get to it the fact is nano was in my mind for people who had time still i had to take a crack at it and for the first few days and weeks i stumbled and fell and tripped over a plot i was sure was trash i just kept on chugging on days when i came home from work and my feet ached so terribly i couldnt take it anymore it was with this sort of exhaustion in me that i got to the last week of nano with nearly twenty five thousand words left i wasnt going to make it then i went through my realization nano was created not for those who had the time but for those who didnt have the time this was for those who couldnt find time to write who lost track of their goal to put pen to paper and who needed a boot to butt to get to the business of writing with the scant time remaining i carved out the twenty five thousand turning out the last 12 000 words in a matter of less than six hours by the time i was finished i didnt even remember how id written so much but id conquered my own mountain in nano that november now im still at the same job still finishing out school still busy but that one push in 2007 got me to realize how hard it is to find the time to write and how vastly rewarding it can be to actually do it this years going to be more of the same only this time im taking eighteen credits at college while i try to train for a career in law enforcement in the future personally i cant wait for the challenge

3834510 eons role is to see if we can shape a new era of power and fulfillment and value at every stage of life starting at 50
3834511 i dont think theres very much offered out there in terms of being inspirational or challenging to these boomers and seniors with a lot more life to live

3834517 ik wou dat ik in de jury van de p c hooftprijs zat dan kon ik je de prijs geven
3834518 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3834519 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3834520 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3834521 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3834522 the public are used to three day closures of primary care services as soon as there is a fourth day closure you dont get an extra days demand it is significantly increased
3834523 this christmas and new year will be very challenging not just for nhs 24 but for out of hours gps and a amp e departments christmas day is generally quiet but once that is past activity increases
3834524 we are in discussion with the scottish government health department about how we could utilise the gp contract to reward gps for opening on holiday monday mornings for example providing an increased flexibility of service for patients
3834525 nobody is saying that all gps have to work on the saturday between christmas and new year there is a role to play but it is not something we are going to impose it is about encouraging nhs 24 to have a sensible discussion on how it can be done better
3834526 it takes the extra bit of heat out of the system that can make the difference between an out of hours service coping and being pushed so that waiting times are unmanageable
3834527 door allerhande omstandigheden komen veel attracties stukken later dan ik gewend was vijf exploitanten moeten vandaag zelfs nog hun zaak opbouwen dat levert in die zin problemen op dat ik dus cht pas op het allerlaatst de kleinvermaakzaken en de kanszaken kan laten aansluiten om een mooi geheel te krijgen
3834528 het is sowieso voor zowel exploitanten als kermismeesters een gek jaar qua data
3834529 met feestdagen begin mei die in n week vielen en eerdere kermissen die de ene keer op dinsdag de andere keer pas op woensdagavond afsluiten
3834530 andere jaren hielden de jongens vaak een weekeinde over ook dat scheelde voor de opbouw van onze kermis dat grillige werkt uiteindelijk het hele kermisseizoen door maar t komt goed morgen gaat de wethouder om drie uur het startschot geven die datum en dat tijdstip daar kunnen we niet omheen
3834531 of we die opening hoog in de lucht in de around the world gaan doen betwijfel ik zeer we hebben allebei niets op met attracties die de hoogte in gaan en deze enorme zweefmolen haalt al gauw de osse grote kerk in
3834532 je blijft hoe dan ook altijd afhankelijk van de weersomstandigheden en die waren tot nu toe op kermissen die er toe doen en dan met name op prime time niet altijd even florissant anderzijds bieden wij de exploitanten een relatief lage inschrijving natuurlijk gekoppeld aan de door de gemeente vastgestelde ritprijs en zijn onze secundaire faciliteiten optimaal met de parkeermogelijkheden bij onze sporthal de rusheuvel hebben we een geweldige slag gemaakt daarnaast betalen we als gemeente z lf de liftinstituut keuring omdat we de veiligheid van de osse burger willen waarborgen en die kosten niet wensen af te wimpelen op de exploitant en de feestavond die we voorafgaand aan de zeven dagen kermisplezier de exploitanten aanbieden wordt door hen erg gewaardeerd
3834533 afgelopen jaar behaalden we landelijk gezien de tweede plaats op de ranglijst van de nederlandse kermisbond
3834534 de kermisvoorwaarden voor 2009 zijn door b en w inmiddels bekrachtigd nee we kiezen niet voor een derde partij die een en ander voor haar rekening neemt dat leidt vaak niet tot betere kermissen maar wel tot hogere ritprijzen
3834535 zelfs draaimolen en autoscooter worden meer en meer opgezadeld met hogere kosten door strengere keuringseisen en kiezen voor grotere plaatsen
3834536 dear lord smite our enemies with rain before they smite us in teh elections
3834537 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3834538 i dont know how political it was i had a high profile case
3834539 i went through all the training i served honorably in my unit i used army provisions to try become a noncombatant and remain in the army as a medic or something but i still would be subject to going on combat missions as a medic
3834540 i cant bring myself to shoot another person if people want to criticize me for that then im honored to be criticized because im not a killer
3834541 well we cant watch this in the bedroom you can watch the olympics there
3834542 well because you did an awesome job with putting my shirts away ok and you know what she did she has some odd inhuman nack for cleanliness and organization shes got them all slanted somehow
3834543 what time will i have to be at the rhode island lead paint hearing to get a seat
3834544 the state does object to defendants request for any costs associated with the litigation of this matter since none of the costs of suit are allowable against the state they are barred by sovereign immunity
3834545 the award of costs to a prevailing party is a right created by statue the general rule is that a statue waiving sovereign immunity which is also in derogation of common law must be strictly construed and whatever right of recovery is to be ascertained against the state must be expressly mentioned ub the waiver of the immunity statue andrade v state
3834546 of course you have memories of such a big tournament and losing
3834547 hes a good player so im very happy with this win because i think this was the first true test in this tournament
3834548 if hes too good for me hes too good for me
3834549 every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top
3834550 but i was just making so many errors and i wasnt practicing like that at all it came to a point i think i hit a backhand in the net and i had just had enough
3834551 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3834552 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3834553 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3834554 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3834555 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3834556 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3834557 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3834558 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3834559 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3834560 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3834561 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3834562 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3834563 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3834564 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3834565 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3834566 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3834567 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3834568 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3834569 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3834570 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3834571 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3834572 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3834573 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3834574 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3834575 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3834576 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3834577 hombre jose por el amor de dios haz alg n gestito que nos hundes no te pido la luna pero haz como que no llevas rodilleras con el zp delante va yo me quito el babero y t las rodilleras te parece podr a ser un inicio pero ha de parecer de verdad eh que si no el invento no nos llega a fin de a o
3834578 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3834579 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3834580 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3834581 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3834582 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3834583 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3834584 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3834585 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3834586 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3834587 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3834588 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3834589 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3834590 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3834591 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3834592 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3834593 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3834594 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3834595 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3834596 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3834597 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3834598 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3834599 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3834600 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3834601 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3834602 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3834603 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3834604 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3834605 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3834606 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3834607 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3834608 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3834609 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3834610 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3834611 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3834612 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3834613 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3834614 who are open to doing something on the production side
3834615 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3834616 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3834617 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3834618 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3834619 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3834620 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3834621 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3834622 despite the best efforts of health professionals the little girl died
3834623 a police inquiry reporting to hm coroner is now under way
3834624 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3834625 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3834626 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3834627 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3834628 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3834629 bound to be the case that theres a quarter or two of negative growth
3834630 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3834631 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3834632 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3834633 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3834634 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3834635 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3834636 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3834637 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3834638 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3834639 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3834640 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3834641 the international medical fraternity can support this endeavour through advocacy and individuals volunteering their time and technical know how to help alleviate the skills gap in the reconstruction of health systems and institutions
3834642 up until this belhaven we all thought the act was being applied consistently
3834643 the health and disability services act is totally unfairly administered
3834644 federal communications commission fcc regulations prohibit telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers automated dialers are standard in the industry so most telemarketers are barred from calling consumers on their cell phones without their consent the national associations representing telemarketers have stated that their clients do not intend to start calling consumers cell phones

3834649 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3834650 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3834651 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3834652 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3834653 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3834654 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3834655 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3834656 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3834657 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3834658 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3834659 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3834660 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3834661 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3834662 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3834685 i dont care how much it costs i want it now
3834686 the so and so fast weight loss workout system name withheld for obvious reasons is actually a decent product but it has major flaws the way that the pulley system works is that the pulleys are attached to the frame with a free rotating bracket this causes an excessive amount of wobbling when trying to use any of the weight loss exercises using the bench press is nearly impossible at higher weights due to the wobbling dont waste your 400 for the
3834687 i purchased the same system through a weight loss products network i was very unhappy with the whole motion of the machine it was uncomfortable and unnatural not to mention very shoddy craftsmanship i called them to return it they said i was past the 1 month return

3834697 we take it for granted that a vote means a secret ballot but it was not always that way
3834698 peel and seed tomatoes cook em for 45 minutes then put an infused olive oil inside it which that fat content i think is really important for the palatability of it the perfume the oil consists of an infusion of basil crushed red pepper and garlic and thats it the idea is we cook it in a big pot so then when we heat the sauce up per order we do it in a sauce pan so theres a larger surface area so that it still maintains its freshness and then we just toss the pasta inside of it finish it with a little bit of butter and a touch of parmesan cheese and then the last thing that goes into the pan is the first flavor the basil

3834747 obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack senior or to his indonesian stepfather missing from the dedication are the grandparents who raised him in hawaii

3834770 we believe the consumers confidence in the housing market is the key to its recovery
3834771 with the passage of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 congress and the white house have offered a lifeline to many homeowners facing foreclosure which should help keep more people in their homes and fewer distressed properties from coming on the market and they have provided an incentive to new customers to move off the fence and become first time buyers in a market that is very much in their favor this may help to restore confidence in the market

3834778 it was a bearish statement regarding the pound in my interpretation
3834779 the economy is cooling in the u k the housing slump is starting to take a toll there too so lower interest rates are ahead the pound is headed lower against the dollar and yen
3834780 the dollar has benefited from a lower oil price and the realization that emerging market economies are slowing but the u s still has many economic headwinds so i still cant be a dollar bull at this point outside of the pound dollar pairing which is really more of a pound weakness play

3834797 the hope is it builds momentum to get a broader public transportation system done
3834798 nobodys claiming that it creates development where the economics wouldnt otherwise support it
3834799 its a combination of higher interest in mixed use development and more housing either in or close in to downtowns

3834859 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing

3834899 fun impaired critics who complained that last weeks pineapple express went over the top ought to get a load of this weeks r rated laugh riot tropic thunder mount everest would look like a speck from this ones extreme altitude which is exactly how it should be ben stillers latest sends up all things overblown about hollywood and the perfect volume setting for this kind of satire is 11
3834900 simultaneously smart and dumb mixing clever satire with way over the top raunch and unrelenting profanity

3834902 tropic thunder is an assault in the guise of a comedy
3834903 watching it is like getting mugged by a clown sure by my bruised reckoning there are a few chuckles here but youll definitely pay a price for them

3834911 if they want to do it and they are talented enough i would support them but theyd have to express an interest on their own
3834912 id rather they didnt pursue it but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood

3835057 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
3835058 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
3835059 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
3835060 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
3835061 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
3835062 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character

3835095 acu rdense de las primeras cosas de mucho tiempo atr s que yo soy el divino y no hay otro dios ni nadie semejante a m aquel que declara desde el principio el final y desde hace mucho las cosas que no se han hecho aquel que dice mi propio consejo subsistir y todo lo que es mi deleite har aquel que llama desde el naciente a un ave de rapi a desde un pa s distante al hombre que ha de ejecutar mi consejo
3835096 as resultar ser mi palabra que sale de mi boca no volver a m sin resultados sino que ciertamente har aquello en que me he deleitado y tendr xito seguro en aquello para lo cual la he enviado
3835097 los justos mismos poseer n la tierra y residir n para siempre sobre ella
3835098 con eso o una voz fuerte desde el trono decir mira
3835099 el que es llamado diablo y satan s que est extraviando o enga ando a toda la tierra habitada
3835100 ahora bien la serpiente result ser la m s cautelosa de todas las bestias salvajes del campo que yehowah dios hab a hecho
3835101 de modo que hacia abajo fue arrojado el gran drag n la serpiente original el que es llamado diablo y satan s que est extraviando a toda la tierra habitada fue arrojado abajo a la tierra y sus ngeles fueron arrojados abajo con l
3835102 d nde te hallabas t cuando yo fund la tierra inf rma me si de veras conoces el entendimiento cuando las estrellas de la ma ana gozosamente clamaron a una y todos los hijos de dios empezaron a gritar en aplauso
3835103 al estar bajo prueba que nadie diga dios me somete a prueba porque con cosas malas dios no puede ser sometido a prueba ni somete a prueba l mismo a nadie m s bien cada uno es probado al ser provocado y cautivado por su propio deseo entonces el deseo cuando se ha hecho fecundo da a luz el pecado a su vez el pecado cuando se ha realizado
3835104 y dios procedi a crear al hombre a su imagen a la imagen de dios lo cre macho y hembra los cre
3835105 todos estos seres humanos podr an adorarme a m en vez de a dios
3835106 ahora bien la serpiente result ser la m s cautelosa de todas las bestias salvajes del campo que yehowah dios hab a hecho
3835107 pero en cuanto al rbol del conocimiento de lo bueno y lo malo no debes comer de l porque en el d a que comas de l positivamente morir s
3835108 por consiguiente la mujer vio que el rbol era bueno para alimento y que a los ojos era algo que anhelar s el rbol era deseable para contemplarlo de modo que empez a tomar de su fruto y a comerlo despu s dio de este tambi n a su esposo cuando l estuvo con ella y l empez a comerlo
3835109 y a ad n dijo porque escuchaste la voz de tu esposa y te pusiste a comer del rbol respecto del cual te di este mandato no debes comer de l maldito est el suelo por tu causa
3835110 por eso as como por medio de un solo hombre el pecado entr en el mundo y la muerte mediante el pecado y as la muerte se extendi a todos los hombres porque todos hab an pecado
3835111 porque todos han pecado y no alcanzan a la gloria de dios
3835112 es un mal rey que miente a sus s bditos y les impide disfrutar de cosas buenas
3835113 pero en cuanto a m el acercarme a dios es bueno para m en el se or soberano yehowah he puesto mi refugio para declarar todas tus obras
3835114 s sabio hijo m o y regocija mi coraz n para que pueda responder al que me est desafiando con escarnio
3835115 todas estas cosas te las dar si caes y me rindes un acto de adoraci n
3835116 de modo que lo llev hacia arriba y le mostr todos los reinos de la tierra habitada en un instante de tiempo y el diablo le dijo te dar toda esta autoridad y la gloria de ellos porque a m me ha sido entregada y a quien yo quiera se la doy
3835117 digno eres t yehowah nuestro dios mismo de recibir la gloria y la honra y el poder porque t creaste todas las cosas y a causa de tu voluntad existieron y fueron creadas
3835118 ahora se somete a juicio a este mundo ahora el gobernante de este mundo ser echado fuera
3835119 ya no hablar mucho con ustedes porque el gobernante del mundo viene
3835120 luego respecto al juicio porque el gobernante de este mundo ha sido juzgado
3835121 ahora si las buenas nuevas que declaramos est n de hecho veladas est n veladas entre los que est n pereciendo entre quienes el dios de este sistema de cosas ha cegado las mentes de los incr dulos para que no pase a ellos la iluminaci n de las gloriosas buenas nuevas acerca del cristo que es la imagen de dios
3835122 el mundo entero yace en el poder del inicuo o maligno
3835123 son de hecho expresiones inspiradas por demonios y ejecutan se ales y salen a los reyes de toda la tierra habitada para reunirlos a la guerra del gran d a de dios el todopoderoso mira vengo como ladr n feliz es el que se mantiene despierto y guarda sus prendas de vestir exteriores para que no ande desnudo y la gente mire su verg enza y los reunieron en el lugar que en hebreo se llama har maged n
3835124 un ni o nos ha nacido un hijo nos ha sido dado y el gobierno reposar sobre sus hombros y se llamar pr ncipe de paz el aumento de su gobierno y el de la paz no tendr n fin
3835125 venga tu reino efect ese tu voluntad como en el cielo tambi n sobre la tierra
3835126 y en los d as de aquellos reyes el dios del cielo establecer un reino que nunca ser reducido a ruinas y el reino mismo no ser pasado a ning n otro pueblo triturar y pondr fin a todos estos reinos y l mismo subsistir hasta tiempos indefinidos
3835127 hay nuevos cielos y una nueva tierra que esperamos seg n la promesa de dios y en estos la justicia habr de morar
3835128 porque miren voy a crear nuevos cielos y una nueva tierra y las cosas anteriores no ser n recordadas ni subir n al coraz n
3835129 ahora bien toda la tierra continuaba siendo de un solo lenguaje y de un solo conjunto de palabras
3835130 que no reciba el c ntuplo ahora en este per odo de tiempo casas y hermanos y hermanas y madres e hijos y campos con persecuciones y en el sistema de cosas venidero vida eterna
3835131 porque tanto am dios al mundo que dio a su hijo unig nito para que todo el que ejerce fe en l no sea destruido sino que tenga vida eterna
3835132 esto significa vida eterna el que est n adquiriendo conocimiento de ti el nico dios verdadero y de aquel a quien t enviaste jesucristo
3835133 y solo un poco m s de tiempo y el inicuo ya no ser y ciertamente dar s atenci n a su lugar y l no ser pero los mansos mismos poseer n la tierra y verdaderamente hallar n su deleite exquisito en la abundancia de paz
3835134 hace cesar las guerras hasta la extremidad de la tierra quiebra el arco y verdaderamente corta en pedazos la lanza quema los carruajes en el fuego
3835135 y l ciertamente dictar el fallo entre las naciones y enderezar los asuntos respecto a muchos pueblos y tendr n que batir sus espadas en rejas de arado y sus lanzas en podaderas no alzar espada naci n contra naci n ni aprender n m s la guerra
3835136 abundancia de paz hasta que la luna ya no sea
3835137 de modo que tienen que poner por obra mis estatutos y deben guardar mis decisiones judiciales y tienen que ponerlas por obra entonces ciertamente morar n en la tierra en seguridad y la tierra verdaderamente dar su fruto y ustedes ciertamente comer n hasta quedar satisfechos y morar n en ella en seguridad
3835138 y mi pueblo tiene que morar en un lugar de habitaci n pac fico y en residencias de plena confianza y en lugares de descanso sosegados
3835139 y realmente se sentar n cada uno debajo de su vid y debajo de su higuera y no habr nadie que los haga temblar porque la boca misma de yehwoah de los ej rcitos lo ha hablado
3835140 llegar a haber abundancia de grano en la tierra en la cima de las monta as habr sobreabundancia
3835141 y ciertamente edificar n casas y las ocupar n y ciertamente plantar n vi as y comer n su fruto
3835142 pero las naciones se airaron y vino tu propia ira y el tiempo se alado para que los muertos sean juzgados y para dar su galard n a tus esclavos los profetas y a los santos y a los que temen tu nombre a los peque os y a los grandes y para causar la ruina de los que est n arruinando la tierra
3835143 abriendo su mano y satisfaciendo el deseo de toda cosa viviente
3835144 y el lobo realmente morar por un tiempo con el cordero y el leopardo mismo se echar con el cabrito y el becerro y el leoncillo crinado y el animal bien alimentado todos juntos y un simple muchachito ser gu a sobre ellos y la vaca y la osa mismas pacer n sus cr as se echar n juntas y hasta el le n comer paja justamente como el toro y el ni o de pecho ciertamente jugar sobre el agujero de la cobra y sobre la abertura para la luz de una culebra venenosa realmente pondr su propia mano un ni o destetado no har n ning n da o ni causar n ninguna ruina en toda mi santa monta a porque la tierra ciertamente estar llena del conocimiento de yehowah como las aguas cubren el mism simo mar
3835145 el lobo y el cordero mismos pacer n como uno solo y el le n comer paja justamente como el toro y en cuanto a la serpiente su alimento ser polvo no har n da o ni causar n ruina en toda mi santa monta a
3835146 en aquel tiempo los ojos de los ciegos ser n abiertos y los o dos mismos de los sordos ser n destapados 6 en aquel tiempo el cojo trepar justamente como lo hace el ciervo y la lengua del mudo clamar con alegr a pues en el desierto habr n brotado aguas y torrentes en la llanura des rtica
3835147 va a haber resurrecci n as de justos como de injustos
3835148 no se maravillen de esto porque viene la hora en que todos los que est n en las tumbas conmemorativas oir n su voz y saldr n los que hicieron cosas buenas a una resurrecci n de vida los que practicaron cosas viles a una resurrecci n de juicio
3835149 ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own

3835156 there were many reasons why we decided to reject the bid made by avies
3835157 they asked us to operate 11 flights a week but our current capacity is only eight frankly i doubt whether they will ever operate 11 flights a week since the local government must cover two thirds of the flight cost
3835158 that the current visual studio 2008 beta 2 vpc images will expire on november 1 2007 rather than march 15 2008 as originally announced
3835159 said he believes both the d language and oslo will be featured at the microsoft professional developers conference pdc in october
3835160 the d language is the reason why the pdc was cancelled last year
3835161 all i know is that they microsoft have been very very quiet about the d language im hoping to see more at the mvp summit but i really dont hold out much hope for the language if they have gone towards making it data driven
3835162 oh look everyone im giving away free giraffe shit come grab a handful
3835163 the current struggles in the auto industry make it more important than ever for automakers to keep the customers they have coming back to purchase another vehicle
3835164 however the increased number of available manufacturers and models make engendering customer loyalty a bigger challenge than ever before automakers who have a firm understanding of what drives their customers to remain loyal will have a significant competitive advantage in this challenging market
3835165 generating customer loyalty is a far more complex process than simply scoring high on initial customer satisfaction surveys or just tracking whether a customer bought another vehicle of the same make
3835166 automakers need to factor in all of their customer touch points across the ownership lifecycle to understand the definition of loyalty that is specifically meaningful to their brands and their customers
3835167 automakers have incredible amounts of customer data from virtually every customer touch point
3835168 bringing that data together with experian automotives assets provides manufacturers with new capabilities in understanding and defining loyalty that drives from the corporate level down to the dealer and service level to reach and retain loyal customers and drive increased revenue
3835169 i think weve frankly gone about as far as we can go
3835170 no 1 hand is one of the most popular ways for sports fans to demand the minimize transactions costs for a healthy marriage
3835171 the credit crisis is broad deep and global and it is not likely to end soon
3835172 investors are significantly underestimating both the scope and the depth of the credit bubble and its subsequent deflation the problems are certainly not limited to large u s institutions that are overexposed to u s subprime the effects are global and far reaching
3835173 the financial sectors problems appear to be far from over we continue to believe that the global financial sector is heading for a massive consolidation
3835174 building this sector is a strategic initiative for our financial services practice
3835175 the 75 search partners team enhances our capabilities within our asset management sector and also increases our presence in the boston market
3835176 the message from investors to corporations is that if we are headed for a recession they should clean up their balance sheets and prepare a financial buffer
3835177 as banks de lever non financial corporations will have to wake up to a far less flexible world of credit
3835178 frankly we are getting some significant interest in our asset sales including hummer but probably it wont be concluded imminently
3835179 by varying the size and shape of seat benchs arpro component designers can tailor the h point the relative vertical location of an occupants hip relative to the floor of the vehicle
3835180 this anti submarining solution is a far reaching new development set to further increase the amount of arpro used in vehicles

3835186 while voip services are being embraced by consumers worldwide businesses have been comparatively slower in their adoption due to various roadblocks this is about to change though as technical issues are resolved for example many pbx manufacturers have already added sip trunking interfaces to their equipment and more recently theyve greatly expanded the list of certified service providers and thats going to fuel the growth in sip trunking services these kinds of developments will boost the overall voip business services segment for years to come

3835188 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him

3835192 day of affiliate summit started with an early 9 10 30am with 9 different speakers in the
3835193 and pretty much answered questions gave new ideas and case studies to everyone at my table it ended up really great and i think this session would have done even better if it was later in the day so more people could have attended
3835194 with all of battling and sporadic demand for something to regulate the affiliate market it seems like nothing ever really gets established nor has made that much of a change
3835195 visual voice mail allows customers to see a list of all of their voice mail messages with important information such as date and time of receipt as well as message duration in order to prioritize and efficiently manage their voice mail messages directly from their phones when a caller leaves a new voice mail message the visual voice mail application pops up alerting the customer that a new voice mail message has been received from the phone display customers can select from a number of options including call back reply forward add to contacts and archive message to internal or external memory customers can store up to 40 messages for 40 days double the storage capacity and nearly double the retention time of basic voice mail in addition customers can create up to 10 greetings as well as up to 20 distribution lists and 50 distribution members to receive messages

3835201 he has the power to unite the marketing and technology and business groups unfortunately japanese companies arent structured that way
3835202 i hope the iphones introduction leads to a sense of crisis at japanese handset makers
3835203 they have been coddled in this market the iphone could be the trigger that forces them to make changes
3835204 restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance
3835205 definitely we are willing to abide by the rules meaning as far as the relationship of the government troops and the milf is concerned there is always a provision provided for under the ceasefire agreement meaning we will abide by whatever the rules are under that agreement

3835216 a bit of star wars related chat this morning on bbc radio 1 uk national radio station
3835217 two men two continents here for a new video at the bbc of ewans and charleys travels
3835218 in the first episode which just aired they are discussing what routes they are taking and ewan mentions an area in northern africa where they were they filmed star wars and talked about how it was so hot it melted his makeup
3835219 long way down ewan amp charley new promo members area oct
3835220 for star wars fans ewan and charlie visit the original set of the moisture farm while in tunisia
3835221 i expected to be mobbed andi wasnt much to the shame of my egotistcal arrogance
3835222 if you guys havent heard already on the next episode of ewans
3835223 ewan and charleys journey from scotland to south africa is even more demanding more riveting and more real than their previous journey
3835224 fox reality channel is the home of exciting domestic and international reality tv covering a wide range of formats and this barrier breaking series fits well within the networks programming strategy
3835225 they were darth vaders feared henchmen and some of the most recognisable figures in cinematic history now the imperial stormtroopers of the star wars films are at the centre of a new epic battle the british prop designer who created their famous white helmets and body armour is being sued by director george lucas for 10m in a case starting at the high court tomorrow andrew ainsworth was sued by the directors company lucasfilm after reproducing the outfits from the original moulds and selling them for up to 1 800 each ainsworth is countersuing lucasfilm for a share of the 6bn merchandising revenue generated since the first film in the series premiered in 1977 the row centres on who actually owns the copyright to the stormtrooper uniforms
3835226 have nothing in my house that i do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful
3835227 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3835228 they all left the building as quick as they could
3835229 im new to dvds i have a few burning questions
3835230 thats right a trip to the council bluffs public library landed patty lyons daughter next to a man surfing porn
3835231 turns out in council bluffs there are no protective filters some of those filters end up blocking out health and other useful sites so the library board voted no
3835232 thats a ruse that the american library association which is very pro pornography and always files lawsuits against the federal government to try to keep pornography widely available put s forward to scare libraries out of having filters
3835233 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3835234 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3835235 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3835236 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3835237 default pathname defaults this is the default defaults alist if the pathname primitives that need a set of defaults are not give one they use this one most programs however should have their own defaults rather than using these
3835238 default pathname defaults this is the default defaults alist if the pathname primitives that need a set of defaults are not give one they use this one most programs however should have their own defaults rather than using these
3835239 to the place where the actual bones of the apostle st james are enshrined in that silver reliquary
3835240 may they blush for shame therefore those envious people beyond the mountains who claim to have some part of it or possess relics of it
3835241 it was about three feet long a foot deep and a foot wide and it contained a quantity of very old bones the party was overwhelmed by emotion one workman fainted and remained blind for half an hour after he had recovered consciousness the clerk of the works was sent to tell the archbishop though the time was 2am and woke up the place by throwing stones at the coachmans window
3835242 i still maintain it doesn t make a shred of difference to the pilgrim experience anyway not for the vast majority of us
3835243 i do hope youll join us to find some very simple answers on seven very simple questions
3835244 the codex is the work of one man he may have been called aimery picaud
3835245 en moralsk fabel om v re et politisk barn i v r tid om ansvar og likegyldighet og om lovene som fortsatt ikke er skrevet
3835246 oh ja ik herinner het me weer hij heet stan dat heb ik gekozen
3835247 it might startle some americans to realize that iran has one of the most pro american populations in the middle east
3835248 we wanted to have a mechanism where a common person can get a sim card without any hassles and other security concerns are also met
3835249 its not going to do anybody any good for me to go out and do what i did last week
3835250 ive got to get to the point where i can pitch without pain
3835251 i didnt feel anything so thats a good thing i couldnt even do this last week
3835252 i was just all over the place couldnt throw a strike
3835253 i need something i have no idea what i think its just going out and getting innings and getting my location obviously its control i aint got that right now
3835254 it just boiled down to the control i didnt have none of it
3835255 i need to get back in a groove and figure something out
3835256 all spring and everything its just been going so slowly trying to get back
3835257 id have to say id be hard pressed to score from second if i had to on a single right now
3835258 i didnt do too much today before the ninth inning
3835259 when i took off from second base there it didnt feel too good
3835260 if they give me the chance im going to be prepared mentally for closing
3835261 i was nervous being out there for the first time in a new season in front of the crowd i was just a little bit excited
3835262 he would throw changeup slider curveball now hes throwing a sinker
3835263 he can throw fastballs predominantly or he can use whatever pitch to get you out
3835264 before i couldnt go in that game even when i threw it easy i felt it
3835265 at least i didnt feel it here when i was playing catch
3835266 i got to get to the level where i feel like i can pitch without feeling pain
3835267 it wouldnt do any good if i do what i did last time
3835268 it sounds like a tall tale and it would take more than a red sox t shirt to put a curse on the yankees
3835269 they have a very good organization the attention to detail has always been there the scouts have always been relentless and tireless a lot of patterns we tried to emulate over here thats how organizations stay good for a long time
3835270 for this organization to be able to win 14 division titles in a row and not do it with a high payroll and do it primarily from building within their own organization its pretty impressive
3835271 we had a lot of turnover from one year to the next
3835272 generally speaking that turnover was always filled with a young guy who came through our organization and then was getting a chance to play every day
3835273 it becomes increasingly more important to not only develop guys in your own system and get them to the big leagues but to constantly have a flow of guys behind them that youre developing that are going to continue to be able to fill in the holes or fill in positions where you have transitions from one year to the next its a constant process so its a tough thing to stay on top of
3835274 you look at the team now and a big percentage of the guys you see out there are home grown guys
3835275 thats kind of the model that theyre probably going to have to continue to follow and a model that i think our organization had a lot to do with in terms of i dont know about creating it but lending proof to the fact that you can do it that way
3835276 they make good decisions through all the process and transitions theyve had
3835277 i dont think youll see a run like they had with 14 straight division titles in baseball it would be very difficult to match that run ever again
3835278 i didnt lose passion for baseball but i fell in love with basketball and stopped playing baseball for about three years
3835279 my brother kept telling me how good i could be he said thats my meal ticket out of griffin so i gotta take it
3835280 hes got tools galore hes got the ability and potential to hit hit for power steal bases and stay at shortstop at the big league level the type of athlete that makes everything he does look easy he glides to balls hit deep in the hole to either side of him and runs the bases gracefully stretching singles into doubles and doubles into triples he has good arm strength soft hands and good instincts that should allow him to star at shortstop for years to come while his defense draws more raves that his bat he has improved at the plate over the last year and is now considered a legitimate threat as he stings the ball to all parts of the field and has also shown the ability to hit the ball out as his body continues to mature and add strength of the past ultra toolsy high school players selected in the top 5 beckham has the best chance of remaining at shortstop with a fluid movement and powerful arm he is blessed with excellent speed that translates to the basepaths as well his hands are extremely smooth and hes able to break in on the ball with rapid movement while bringing the ball from his glove to his throwing hand faster than any shortstop in recent memory profiles as a number two hitter with excellent contact skills and extra base power easily could become a perennial 30 30 threat beckhams best asset at the plate is his uncanny patience unafraid to take a walk and allow the player behind him to drive him in
3835281 he understands you are going to strike out he understands you are going to make errors and if that ever happens he keeps playing right through it thats going to help him get to where he wants to go he is good about keeping his temperament he never gets way up he never gets way down
3835282 griffin ga is a small town where everyone knows everyone and its easy to get caught up in the wrong things sometimes hes done a good job of keeping his head on the prize and focused on his future for him to take this route means a great deal
3835283 i dont know how much im going to get but if i do get a lot ill be able to take care of my family id move my dad out of an apartment and id move my mom out of an apartment too
3835284 i couldve gone and played football at some smaller schools like air force ohio and wake forest and i couldve played and been a contributor or gone to some sec schools and been a low key player
3835285 i figured my future was probably in baseball even though i wasnt really looked at as a big talent
3835286 its just getting older and understanding what it takes to be successful its almost learning to fail i guess is the best way to say it this is a game of failure when you finally understand youre not going to be perfect the game gets easier
3835287 he always had the tools and skills but he always got off to a bad start he was trying to do too much too soon now hes letting the game come to him hes not having to carry bad at bats out to the field i think thats all it was him understanding what kind of talent he has and slowing it down
3835288 every player is inherently different therefore in my opinion it makes no sense to model your game after someone i believe you need to watch major leaguers see how they carry themselves and see how they handle their business i would love to lead my team the way derek jeter does but other than that i dont model my game after anyone
3835289 its very frustrating to play a baseball game when you have guys on the other team constantly just chirping like a softball team this is not softball its baseball i was very frustrated with it because thats not the way you play baseball in my opinion some people believe that thats the way you play but i was just very frustrated when michael demperio got on that inning i was like if he throws it anywhere near the plate im gonna hit it as hard as i can and thats what happened he left a fastball right down the middle and i crushed it its very frustrating playing baseball teams that act like that because its mickey mouse stuff

3835295 every seven years everything changes your physical being your emotional being the way other people look at you
3835296 hes the most underappreciated player in the game no doubt alex rodriguez is the most talented player ive played with but chipper is right behind him
3835297 chipper could get a lot more attention in new york or l a but hes a country boy who likes to hunt and fish
3835298 atlanta is a laid back town and im not a big city guy i know i could probably garner more attention and accumulate more accolades in new york but thats not me
3835299 back when i went through my first marriage my first divorce everything that hit the papers i had to be a little bit of a recluse because i never knew who was going to come at me trying to start something trying to get me to knock them out in a club or something it only takes one i could not afford to get my name in the papers again i kept everyone at an arms length at that point
3835300 i know that the kids look up to and idolize us but what people have to understand is that we are intense individuals who want to succeed sometimes the emotion of the moment causes you to say and do things that are not g rated but that doesnt make us bad people i was always passionate about the game i came from a baseball family my dad was drafted by the cubs i told my mom when i was 4 that i was gonna play in the big leagues one day i know the passion doesnt shine through all the time as like anything else i might be dealing with an injury or just flat out tired but i take the field to win everyday
3835301 i read yalls paper and go online and check out the rumor mill
3835302 i read the blogs pretty often i like to know what is being said not so much during the the season because i dont have that much time but in the offseason i read quite a bit especially when we make moves just to see how jacked up u guys get
3835303 being a lot more comfortable with what is going on at home
3835304 i didnt feel that way back early in my career there were so many stars here smoltz maddux glavine i felt so out of place saying something in the clubhouse even though people wanted me to i just didnt feel comfortable doing it now i have no problem ill jump in someones face in a heartbeat if i feel that it is warranted
3835305 they dont play a lot of games at 3 oclock
3835306 said in jest but he got the hint when were out there taking batting practice jerking the balls over the left field wall yeah its all fun and sexy the fans in the stands love it but youre not working on what you need to be working on and thats driving the ball the other way and getting that muscle memory because pitchers are not just gonna put the ball right down the middle middle in and let you jerk it into the parking lot theyre gonna work the outside corner with their slider so we kinda need to work on that just a little subtle hint here and they get the gist of it
3835307 ya know there is a wall out there in right center quite a few of mine have gone the other way
3835308 some of us actually shy away from the buffet table some of us camp out at the buffet table
3835309 frenchy and bmac really make it fun to come to the park they both act like 12 year olds and that rubs off on the rest of us they are constantly needling each other and it makes for hours of laughter for us old coots but they are intense at game time and they want to win does it make me feel younger no but it is a nice change from the way the clubhouse used to be
3835310 its not my place i sit there and i listen to them haggle they won the last two alright ill give it ya we did it for 14 straight and didnt say a word everybody just assumed we were gonna be at the top ill let them talk back and forth honestly they can have the division our sights are set a little higher than that
3835311 dont get me wrong theyve had some good years but come talk when youve won 14 in a row
3835312 my concern is trying to give the team the chance to win a championship
3835313 im one of the guys who if i quit right now i wouldnt make it im on the cusp the next five or six years will tell the tale
3835314 chipper jones the legend went out long before the candle ever did
3835315 frenchy and bmac really make it fun to come to the park they both act like 12 year olds and that rubs off on the rest of us they are constantly needling each other and it makes for hours of laughter for us old coots but they are intense at game time and they want to win it is a nice change from the way the clubhouse used to be

3835355 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers

3835363 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency
3835364 john mccain stood up against george bush and don rumsfeld in the prosecution of the iraq war for many years
3835365 ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
3835366 id like to start out by giving you a little straight talk under the present setup because weve mortgaged our childrens futures you will not have social security benefits that present day retirees have unless we fix it and americans have got to understand that americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today emphasis added and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its gotta be fixed

3835374 we made the decision to go the dual enrollment route instead of the advanced placement route colleges vary so much in whether and how they award credity for a p course so we offer some general education college courses here at woodstock the cadets actually receive a transcript from us and then a separate transcript from shenandoah university for the college level courses they passe like freshmen english and math classes for example
3835375 there are over 28 sports and competitive teams to choose from
3835376 unlike many public high schools if you want to play football you play whatever their sport at mma every kid plays

3835397 i dont believe the competition is really between the local banks the competition is between the local banks and the foreign banks
3835398 if you look at other markets where consolidation has been resisted many of the banks are now owned by foreigners and local banks have been largely marginalised why because the local banks were not big enough to compete with the global behemoths that can come in and buy market share

3835477 kita bukan hendak minta maaf tetapi hanya untuk menerangkan perkara ini saya tidak bermaksud untuk mempertikaikan hak orang melayu dan bumiputera lain serta tujuan uitm ditubuhkan di bawah perkara 153 perlembagaan persekutuan
3835478 apa yang saya cadangkan sebelum ini hanya pandangan yang dikemukakan oleh pihak media kepada saya
3835479 oleh itu saya harap isu ini tidak lagi dipanjangkan dan uitm tidak perlu lagi menumpukan kepada isu kuota ini tetapi memberi fokus kepada usaha meningkatkan taraf dan kemudahannya untuk menjadi sebuah universiti yang disegani
3835480 permatang pauh memerlukan seorang wakil rakyat yang boleh berada di kawasan setiap masa dan memberi khidmat terbaik untuk penduduk
3835481 kadar baru caj satu peratus itu adalah berdasarkan kadar rata ke atas semua pinjaman peringkat pengajian melibatkan semua bakal peminjam yang akan diproses melalui sistem baru bermula disember ini
3835482 ia juga meliputi peminjam sedia ada dan peminjam yang telah tamat belajar tetapi belum menyelesaikan bayaran pinjaman mereka
3835483 mereka diberikan tempoh selama sebulan dari tarikh surat tawaran untuk melengkapkan dokumen perjanjian baru dan memulangkan semula kepada ptptn sebelum kadar baru dilaksanakan
3835484 kalau mereka tidak menandatangani surat perjanjian baru itu mereka akan terus dikenakan caj perkhidmatan mengikut kadar sedia ada
3835485 mereka dipercayai turut terlibat dalam beberapa kes pecah rumah dan kecurian sebelum ini
3835486 had a noticeable effect on box office weekly sales surged the week that aiken joined the cast and took a steep tumble shortly after he departed
3835487 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
3835488 you shall have the sensation that you feel to go once again you ll feel drown but the same rhythm of the heart will sound right here in my soul and for the end of our times
3835489 i m the runabout of my life like a movie with raj kapur
3835490 tu soy la chica turca rumana a young man from spain was asking about you
3835491 nico is 4 km away from here in the next albergue and he wants to show you something
3835492 everything is changing in my point of view i have arrived to my city a couple or three days ago and as i suposed all is the same it s like that film with bill murray where he has to live in the same day everytime but now something is diferent i have learned that things are not so easy but i have learned that you have not to see the next five meters no you have to see to the end of the world to the end of the words
3835493 we want to make hancher not just how it was but even better
3835494 we are a better and more fair and just country because of the americans with disabilities act
3835495 i dont think that the appearance of a conflict of interests means there is a conflict
3835496 it is two different things i didnt in any way feel that it was in any way tied to the rice project
3835497 i did not profit from this and i think that is a key part of the community intrigue about a person like me in this situation
3835498 i have tried to handle this episode just as we recommend to our customers being transparent honest and upfront
3835499 i do regret i wasnt more assertive in disclosing some of this
3835500 in the period of the whole rice thing i dropped it
3835501 i wouldnt have taken money from the corporation at that time and i wasnt going to start any business venture with him
3835502 it was not something that i would have felt good about
3835503 i have really been concerned about a public story about ed owing me money on this and that hurting his family for his best friend to be the next one in line to say they got shorted
3835504 if that is how they feel they need to go back to mexico
3835505 americans are smart enough that they dont need a nanny state taking care of them all the time
3835506 this is no surprise at all people believe the company is worth more and that roche can afford to pay more the game of chess has begun
3835507 im very optimistic about the fact that a year from now or a year and a half from now the market will be very high
3835508 in 1998 and 1999 stocks were really down but the companies then were not really full of assets now the boxes are full
3835509 doctors dont want patients to suffer they want people to get better
3835510 but they feel stress they feel time constraints they have to deal with pre authorizations its not the kind of practice they wanted theyre stressed and that leads to moving patients along
3835511 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3835512 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that
3835513 the patient needs to realize that the doctor may not be able to discern whats going on in the first visit often it takes a few visits
3835514 if you say its really depressing and upsetting me im in so much pain
3835515 doctors will see it in terms of emotion and treat it as an emotional problem referring you to psychiatric care or antidepressants
3835516 patients really need to be persistent about their complaints in a way that is constructive to get across to the physician that this is something real
3835517 there are some physicians who are more open to listening than others it may take a few doctors to find a marriage
3835518 one of the biggest speculative endeavors was the hunt for whale oil
3835519 one thing that killed it off was the gold rush the same kind of guy that goes out to sea for two year was lured into the gold rush
3835520 it really has nothing to do with the underlying facts and figures
3835521 its the gambling nature of certain capital coupled with the frustration of nothing else working
3835522 adrenalin is the best painkiller and the crowd could see i was struggling and really got behind me they were fantastic
3835523 its just the drive that got me through i suppose
3835524 ive trained for so many years for this my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3835525 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3835526 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3835527 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3835528 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3835529 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3835530 my time was pretty average i have had a lot of experience at 200 of going out too fast and struggling at the end at the worlds i went off ridiculously fast and got smashed on the last 50 but i have learned from my mistakes
3835531 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3835532 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3835533 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3835534 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3835535 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3835536 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3835537 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3835538 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3835539 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3835540 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3835541 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3835542 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3835543 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3835544 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3835545 its unthinkable why someone would take someones car when they are just trying to help a man who has been seriously hurt
3835546 this womans compassion has been totally taken advantage of by a pathetic opportunistic thief and we are determined to catch whoever was responsible
3835547 now you can see whats really going on with your neighborhoods prices right now dollars per square foot numbers of homes for sale days on market price reductions
3835548 train up a child in the way he should go even when he is old he will not depart from it
3835549 the process of your children embracing the things of god as their own living faith to see your children develop identities as persons under god
3835550 my son if your heart is wise then my heart will be glad
3835551 listen to your father who gave you life and do not despise your mother when she is old
3835552 my son give me your heart and let your eyes keep to my ways
3835553 faith comes by hearing and hearing through the word of christ
3835554 he said sorry i gave him a hug and told him not to worry about it
3835555 ive no criticism of him because he worked so hard to chase him down and thats what can happen when you are playing hard hockey right on the edge
3835556 i was really proud of the way we played and it wasnt too far off our best given our current capabilities
3835557 we were in a pretty strong position when holland were down to 10 but then we went down to 10 and it was probably back to advantage them

3835559 para ser una luz para nosotros mismos hemos de liberarnos de toda tradici n de toda autoridad comprendida la de quien habla de manera que nuestras propias mentes puedan mirar observar y aprender
3835560 la verdadera ciencia ense a por encima de todo a dudar y a ser ignorante
3835561 gran parte de las dificultades por las que atraviesa el mundo se deben a que los ignorantes est n completamente seguros y los inteligentes llenos de dudas
3835562 dudar de cualquier sistema o doctrina de cualquier certeza adquirida aunque sea a trav s de la duda misma para no caer en los espejismos de las apariencias

3835572 los animales existen en el mundo por sus propias razones no fueron hechos para el ser humano del mismo modo que los negros no fueron hechos para los blancos ni la mujer para el hombre
3835573 imitamos a los lobos y a los leopardos y somos peor que ellos debido a que dios nos ha honrado con el habla y la equidad nos hemos vuelto peores que bestias salvajes
3835574 la no violencia gu a hacia las ticas m s perfectas que es la meta de toda evoluci n no ser hasta que dejemos de lastimar a las dem s criaturas vivientes que seguiremos siendo salvajes
3835575 si un ser sufre no puede existir justificaci n moral para rehusar tomar ese sufrimiento en consideraci n no importa la naturaleza del ser el principio de igualdad requiere que su sufrimiento se considere igual al sufrimiento semejante de cualquier otro ser
3835576 mientras los humanos sigan masacrando y devorando a sus hermanos los animales reinar en la tierra la guerra y el sufrimiento y se matar n unos a otros pues aqu l que siembra el dolor y la muerte no puede cosechar ni la alegr a ni la paz ni el amor

3835591 this 11th hour ruling from the is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3835592 as president will fight to maintain the strong protections of the
3835593 in this case it was determined that we need to move forward in a timely fashion
3835594 barack obama has the unique ability to bring people together from all political backgrounds democrats republicans and independents partisan business as usual has crippled washington its time for a president who will work to unite our country and bring about the change we need
3835595 barack obama will stand up for alaskas families as president hell support the alaska natural gas pipeline and work to lower the skyrocketing fuel prices that have caused an energy crisis here in fairbanks he has a plan to move this country forward and will be a president who is as independent as alaskans are
3835596 im grateful for mayor whitakers support fairbanks residents are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country mayor whitaker knows firsthand the importance of solving our energy crisis he believes as i do that we need to bring people together in order to solve the many challenges our country is facing right now from energy to the economy
3835597 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by any party affiliation
3835598 he said his endorsement should not be viewed as one of the democratic party noting that absent criminal convictions of republican sen ted stevens or rep don young he would be supporting their respective re election campaigns
3835599 also i want to tell sen obama and any of the other candidates willing to listen that the price of freedom doesnt have to be blood it can be sweat
3835600 immediately after the invasion of iraq i wrote to president bush saying
3835601 whitaker a former state lawmaker said a comparison of obama and republican sen john mccain neither of whom he has personally met leads him to believe obama has the stronger

3835603 several endangered species have already been found in the snakes stomachs
3835604 pythons could have even more significant environmental and economic consequences if they were to spread from florida to other states
3835605 although other factors such as type of food available and suitable shelter also play a role burmese pythons and other giant constrictor snakes have shown themselves to be highly adaptable to new environments
3835606 by using more complete climate data in this case 19 variables measuring climatic extremes averages and seasonal variation we can make more accurate predictions of
3835607 combining this climatic data with localities for the burmese python allows us to create powerful models for predicting suitable habitat for the snakes
3835608 the burmese python is strongly limited to the small area of suitable environmental conditions in the united states it currently inhabits due to the preferences of the snake
3835609 global warming is predicted to significantly reduce the area of suitable habitat worldwide underscoring the potential negative effects of climate change for many species

3835677 if we can show that we can burn helium 3 it is a much cleaner and safer energy source than other nuclear fuels
3835678 i dont think that the main motivation to go back to the moon is helium 3
3835679 but over the long term we do face an energy problem
3835680 this reduces radiation issues and also greatly simplifies the engineering
3835681 helium 3 is present on the moon but in very small concentration levels meaning that many hundreds of millions of tons of soil must be processed to extract a ton of helium 3
3835682 our real challenge is not obtaining the helium 3 it is demonstrating that we can burn it
3835683 one should never say never it may come to pass that helium 3 could become an important source of energy in the coming century
3835684 that time has not come yet and i suspect that it is still some time off

3835741 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3835742 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3835743 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3835744 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3835745 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3835746 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3835747 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont

3835756 the united states is now expected to raise its interest rates much sooner than in europe
3835757 investors are pricing in those expectations to the dollar and euro
3835758 investors still arent comfortable with the georgian war with russia
3835759 theyre taking their money out of europe and putting it into the united states where they feel its safe
3835760 this just means that the pound has become very weak the dollar is not necessarily that strong
3835761 bank earnings were worrisome and third quarter earnings are expected to be worse
3835762 the market has already priced in a 50 basis point ratehike which will widen the interest rate gap with the unitedstates even more and make the local currency more attractive toinvestors

3835768 our data establish an essential cell autonomous role for trkb in regulating hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral sensitivity to antidepressive treatments and support the notion that impairment of the neurogenic niche is an etiological factor for refractory responses to antidepressive regimen in mice
3835769 niche modeling is a quick and straightforward approach to addressing problems that molecular data will eventually solve
3835770 also testing niche models in the present and past is the first step in making predictions about where species will move in the future given global warming scenarios

3835774 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3835775 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3835776 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out

3835778 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3835779 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3835780 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3835781 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3835782 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand

3835786 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3835787 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3835788 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3835789 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them

3836011 when president umaru yaradua was elected alongside dr goodluck jonathan i thought that their administration would make and implement policies that would have positive impact on the economy and the society at large since both of them were former university lecturers

3836118 current uncertain economic conditions combined with a significant downturn in rv demand
3836119 the price of gas will impact a persons travel habits but for the rv industry its really about the lack of financing thats causing the current downward trend in rv sales
3836120 consumer confidence is factor too people have less confidence to make a larger ticket purchase and rvs are discretionary purchases so theyre more difficult to justify
3836121 but its not like the suv market where everyone is running away because of the price of gas
3836122 one of the common ways people finance an rv purchase especially for the bigger vehicles is by taking out a home equity loan and that has of course become more problematic lately because home prices have fallen and people have less home equity
3836123 theres about four five six different variables not just one focus point you have escalating food prices you cant turn on the tv or radio without hearing its another record setting day for fuel and i think thats probably one of the biggest concerns right now not only of rvers but everybody they dont know where this is going to settle in

3836143 if anyone is never at fault in what he says he is a perfect man able to keep his whole body in check
3836144 turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers
3836145 bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name

3836147 i am a canadian free to speak without fear free to worship in my own way free to stand for what i think right free to oppose what i believe wrong or free to choose those who shall govern my country this heritage of freedom i pledge to uphold for myself and all mankind
3836148 as we express our gratitude we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them
3836149 current uncertain economic conditions combined with a significant downturn in rv demand
3836150 the price of gas will impact a persons travel habits but for the rv industry its really about the lack of financing thats causing the current downward trend in rv sales
3836151 consumer confidence is factor too people have less confidence to make a larger ticket purchase and rvs are discretionary purchases so theyre more difficult to justify
3836152 but its not like the suv market where everyone is running away because of the price of gas
3836153 one of the common ways people finance an rv purchase especially for the bigger vehicles is by taking out a home equity loan and that has of course become more problematic lately because home prices have fallen and people have less home equity
3836154 theres about four five six different variables not just one focus point you have escalating food prices you cant turn on the tv or radio without hearing its another record setting day for fuel and i think thats probably one of the biggest concerns right now not only of rvers but everybody they dont know where this is going to settle in
3836155 mein start war nicht optimal da ich mit meinen reifen auf der wei en linie keinen grip bekommen habe
3836156 in den ersten runden war ich noch zuversichtlich jules berholen zu k nnen allerdings gab es sehr viele gelbe flaggen was einen angriff unm glich machte
3836157 so you better start swimmin or youll sink like a stone because the times they are a changin
3836158 it was a bearish statement regarding the pound in my interpretation
3836159 the economy is cooling in the u k the housing slump is starting to take a toll there too so lower interest rates are ahead the pound is headed lower against the dollar and yen
3836160 the dollar has benefited from a lower oil price and the realization that emerging market economies are slowing but the u s still has many economic headwinds so i still cant be a dollar bull at this point outside of the pound dollar pairing which is really more of a pound weakness play
3836161 needs to see some signs of gdp strength in the u s
3836162 over the last 30 years there have not been many times when airline traffic declined at such a steady rate
3836163 the largest decline was seen after the 9 11 tragedy and 2008 is seeing a comparable decline
3836164 its predicted that in 2008 the airline industry will lose over 10 billion dollars
3836165 fuel is one of the most important factors for an airline
3836166 the luggage adds more weight and in turn uses more fuel making it more expensive for the plane to fly
3836167 i think the high gas prices may actually have increased our ticket sales to dulles
3836168 since we are such a small airport our load capacity really varies depending on the day of the week
3836169 there is certainly room for capacity to increase to above 80 percent in the near future travelers will notice planes to be fuller as years go by
3836170 i hoped we wouldnt see each other what do you need me for
3836171 weve had this talk before havent we you want to know why the dead seek you out

3836232 we are not prepared right now to face the opportunities the arctic offers us nor are we properly aware of the threats that lie just over the horizon of climate change and the need to adapt to it throughout the circumpolar north
3836233 weve nevertheless eliminated the position of canadian circumpolar ambassador and allowed the northern dimension of canadian foreign policy component to wither away despite our sometimes vocal attachment as canadians to the north these negative developments of our own making have been met with hardly a murmur of concern
3836234 weve got to get serious about circumpolar politics and act now in concert with the other ice states and indigenous peoples for collective stewardship in the evolution of the arctic as region in its own right

3836361 the problem with mr mahmoud ahmadinejad is that not only he himself do not understand anything about modern economy but because of his firm belief that mahdi the muslim shias twelfth imam would soon reappear and arrange everything to the liking of the iranians he has no confidence in economic experts and listen to no one except yes men
3836362 at the same time with a yes and no policy the ruling ayatollahs also hope that the six or at least four of them meaning minus russia and china would get serious in implementing the sanctions thus providing iranian officials the tools to portray the islamic republic as a victim of the imperialists and justify more sacrifices from the iranian people including accepting more repressions more censorship of the press and expressions more restrictions on the already badly limited social and cultural freedoms
3836363 this is a very good case of iranian ambivalence the regime rejects the present world order wants to change it starting by the united nations a body it regards as an object at the hands of the united nations and the five permanent members of the security council while at the same time not only it continue its membership of the organisation but also wants to enter the security council
3836364 if china and russia have signed the three resolutions against iran is that they consider themselves as part of this international order and do not want to change it
3836365 syria of president bashar assad which contrary to his iranian counterpart does not seek the annihilation of israel would certainly leave the camp of the regions radicals led by iran and join the west if and when it can trust washington and tel aviv the day damascus recovers the golan heights it would establish full relations with israel
3836366 bashar is preparing himself for this historic moment a move that would certainly change the face of the middle east this is what very probably assad informed the iranians during his last visit to tehran last week and very probably he also told iranians that it is time for them to change to the regions new realities

3836372 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3836373 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3836374 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3836375 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that

3836395 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3836396 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3836397 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3836398 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3836399 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3836400 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3836401 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3836402 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3836403 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3836404 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3836405 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3836406 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3836407 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3836408 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3836409 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3836411 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3836412 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3836413 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3836414 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3836437 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3836438 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3836439 i think right now shes capable of doing anything she wants right now shes having a good meet shes won two medals and set an american record i remember when matt biondi was supposed to win seven golds and he got a bronze in his first race and everyone asked are you disappointed he said nah i just want to win a gold medal you kind of have to look at it like that
3836440 theres a lot of people walking around this pool deck with no medals and katies got two medals shes got a relay tomorrow and an 800 free coming up which could be awesome part of the thing with katie is she has a lot of chances to do well and thats one of the reasons she entered such a big program
3836441 well certainly if youre just trying to peak in one event its one thing but she did hit her peak today in the 200 freestyle its the fastest shes ever gone and she did set an american record

3836449 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3836450 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3836451 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3836452 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3836453 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3836454 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3836455 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3836456 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3836457 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3836458 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3836459 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3836460 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3836461 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3836462 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3836463 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3836464 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3836465 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3836466 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3836471 we had an issue with 3 5 update 2 its actually a licensing problem
3836472 currently what we know is that licensing prevents new virtual machines from powering up after shutdowns and it prevents virtual motioning moving a virtual machine from one host to another

3836477 tuve la suerte de hacer cuatro luchas y quedar noveno por ser la primera vez que entro en unos juegos ol mpicos creo que es un muy buen resultado
3836478 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3836479 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3836480 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3836481 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3836482 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3836483 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3836484 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3836485 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3836486 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3836487 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3836488 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3836489 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3836507 a solemn assembly a gathering of all ages races and denominations the 12 hours of thecall are spent primarily before the lord in prayer and worship
3836508 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
3836509 i thought we got some great work in today i thought both sides were very professional in their approach we have a little different schemes on both sides of the ball and it was good work for dallas and obviously the broncos we have a practice this afternoon and im looking forward to that
3836510 they have a different type of offense and a different type of defense we get a chance to work against a 3 4 look and they get a chance to take a look at a four man front i thought it was good for both teams it was a very healthy practice and there was some good fresh hitting you go against somebody where you dont know their tendencies so everybody plays a little bit more honest and its a good evaluation process for us
3836511 what you want to do when youre taking a look at your otas when youre taking a look at your summer camp you want to find your best 53 guys that can play you want to get better as a scheme offensively defensively and special teams this is a little bit different here normally that third week of practice you get tired of hitting against each other this is a good changeup for both teams where you get a chance to go against different schemes and different people i thought it was good for both squads
3836512 normally the first couple of weeks of training camp you want to install your offense and defense to go against a team too early would kind of take away what you are trying to put in as your basic fundamentals to installing your offense defense and special teams usually its better before your second preseason game because you have all of that installation in you have a preseason game under your belt you know who you want to evaluate and you get a chance to do it against different people
3836513 you change it up we went there last year obviously they are playing at our facility so they are going to come here we will probably do the same thing next year if we play the cowboys in preseason
3836514 we brought in a couple of corners poole and cb wale dada that we thought would give us more depth at that position guys that we feel have more of a chance to make our football team sometimes you make changes after a game based on how they play we didnt feel like either of those players cb lamont reid and cb christian morton could make our football team so we went in a different direction and brought some guys in that we thought could compete for possibly making our squad
3836515 he has been playing with the first team and second team throughout camp we have some competition there at middle linebacker and we will find out at the end of camp who steps up and who is our starter we have two guys koutouvides and lb nate webster that are practicing extremely well and we want to give both guys a chance to practice and play with the first team unit part of the evaluation process is how they play in practice and how thy play here in the games so we will have a chance to do both
3836516 i dont know if he picks his play up any more brandon has been doing this throughout camp i think you get a chance to see him against different people and obviously a very good football team in the cowboys its always nice to see a guy step up and make some plays like he did
3836517 naturally it does players and coaches you want to perform in front of your peers you want to practice well you want to play well and at the same time we want to evaluate a lot of people we have a chance to do it all today
3836518 to be honest with you they take advantage of an opportunity rb selvin young was obviously injured at texas but he came in here stayed healthy and took advantage of an opportunity any time you get a scholarship and are averaging about five and a half to six yards per carry at texas you know you have a big upside and he is taking advantage of that opportunity here
3836519 well he guaranteed 2 000 yards i think so he is going to be much better we have a long way to go though
3836520 i thought it went well obviously they are one of the best teams in the nfl theyre big physical and fast it went well though we are going to go back and look at the tapes to see what we did well and what we didnt do so well on but its definitely good to get somebody else in here instead of the same defenses over and over again i thought it went well
3836521 thats exactly what it is for us we have a young team with a lot of new guys dallas is one of the top three teams in the nfl it gives us a good measuring stick to see where we are at and exactly how far we need to go
3836522 dallas is dallas and they are going to do whatever they are going to do we are the broncos and we are not going to try and emulate them we are going to handle ourselves exactly the way our owner does and the way mike shanahan does we are going to be first class and go about our business
3836523 i talked with him before practice and he has dealt with it for a long time he said it was manageable just like i have been doing for the last four or five months he went through his career with it and i dont see any reason why i cant
3836524 we have two young guys on the outside ryan clady and ryan harris they are young but they are fighting i think they are going to be good if not great tackles in the future both ryans got a taste against houston and this is going to be a good test for them in the next two days im comfortable and i think they have done a great job so far
3836525 you see some guys breathing a little bit harder brandon marshall was gassed because he was so juiced up you have adrenaline running and it is fun it is game like out here and you get to see somebody different go against different looks and gauge where you are at i love doing it

3836639 que esto no debe ser subestimado mucho m s cuando est cerca un proceso electoral
3836640 ellos me dijeron que la disip hab a enviado dos millones de d lares un mill n es para m y pueden doblar la cantidad
3836641 es un regalo de todos nosotros en su cumplea os
3836642 puesto que era necesaria una revoluci n las circunstancias designaron una juventud para hacerla s lo la juventud despertaba c lera y s lo la juventud ten a pureza
3836643 las propuestas son claves la gente lo que est demandando y valorando son las propuestas del candidato las credenciales y las garant as que ofrece despu s la condici n pol tica del candidato
3836644 para dejar de ser oposici n y convertirse en proposici n las demandas de los ciudadanos van mas all de la condici n pol tica es decir la condici n de candidato nico de oposici n no es suficiente
3836645 acentuar el sentimiento de exclusi n y estigmatizar a la oposici n como amenaza a los logros simb licos que los sectores populares han ganado en los ltimos a os y van a fortalecer el portaaviones van a relanzar la gesti n y veremos al presidente ch vez inaugurando obras y van a concentrar el discurso de los candidatos chavistas en ofertas

3836650 no han hecho otra cosa sino someterse a la voluntad del presidente de la rep blica
3836651 hemos visto nuevamente en este nuevo episodio de la reforma de contrabando como todos los poderes p blicos se arrodillan ante la voluntad del jefe de estado lav ndose las manos de su responsabilidad la asamblea nacional le otorg poderes al presidente por un lapso de 18 meses para legislar en cualquier materia luego observamos como el tribunal supremo de justicia le concedi el car cter org nico a las leyes y en el d a de ayer le toc al poder moral con las tristes declaraciones de la fiscal general de la rep blica
3836652 la fiscal general act a como una vocera m s del partido de gobierno
3836653 adem s de admitir que solamente ha le do 3 de las 26 leyes la fiscal sale a proclamar que ninguna de stas viola la constituci n pero resulta que s viola nuestra carta magna y de manera muy clara el articulo 206 referente al capitulo del poder legislativo nacional en la secci n que trata sobre la formaci n de leyes se ala muy claro que cuando una ley afecte a los estados tienen que ser consultados a trav s de los consejos legislativos quienes a su vez tienen que consultar a la sociedad civil preg ntele entonces fiscal general s a ellos no les afecta el art culo 70 de la ley de administraci n p blica el cual le otorga potestad al presidente de nombrar autoridades regionales que no su tarea no ser otra sino pasarle por encima a gobernadores y alcaldes y adem s est el art culo 211 que obliga a un proceso de consulta a los ciudadanos y a la sociedad organizada as como a todos los poderes p blicos y a los estados d nde queda la democracia participativa y protag nica
3836654 hay que ser bien cara dura para decirnos que teniendo 18 meses para legislar este contrabando es una emergencia nacional
3836655 si la oposici n comete el error de ir dividido en algunos municipios o gobernadores a quien le va a quedar la decisi n en sus manos es al elector y el elector votar por aquella persona que represente el verdadero liderazgo en esa regi n o en ese municipio
3836656 hicimos un compromiso formal de honor y ad dio unas declaraciones reconociendo quienes estaban de primero en 19 estados eso es algo sumamente importante nosotros como partido pol tico estamos obligados a responder con madurez los partidos hist ricos en este pa s tenemos una responsabilidad mayor y no est n dependiendo de la voluntad de alguien en particular sino que tenemos que responder a un colectivo

3836659 que deben tomar para s la lucha para defender la voluntad popular del 02 de diciembre porque eso es el antecedente para que se les reconozcan sus respectivos triunfos en alcald as y gobernaciones
3836660 esperamos que los inhabilitados ayuden a la oposici n con su liderazgo apoyando a aquellos que est n en defecto de ellos como candidatos
3836661 el acuerdo del 23 de enero es un compromiso y hemos hecho el mejor de nuestros esfuerzos para honrarlo pero en el acuerdo hab a cosas no previstas como los empates en las encuestas no estaba resuelto una especie de subcampeonato es por eso que sentimos que hemos hecho el mejor de nuestros esfuerzos pero no se acab anoche el esfuerzo unitario de cara al 23 de noviembre hay que seguir trabajando por la unidad hay que ense ar una ruta unitaria de aqu al 23
3836662 hoy debemos trabajar por la unidad de la sociedad venezolana y el pr ximo 23 ser n elecciones para elegir a gobernadores que rescaten la descentralizaci n alcaldes que brinden mas y mejores servicios p blicos
3836663 la unidad no se ha formalizado todav a porque sino no hubiesen estas demostraciones que est dando la gente que quiere que el candidato sea en realidad del pueblo

3836720 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3836721 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3836722 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out

3836725 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions

3836749 electoral politics is the primary form of black political struggle
3836750 the most significant black struggle has occurred in the streets

3836789 expensive new antipsychotic drugs that are among the most widely prescribed pills in medicine are no more effective and no safer than an older cheaper drug that has been largely discontinued according to the most comprehensive comparative study ever conducted
3836790 a landmark government financed study that compared drugs used to treat schizophrenia has confirmed what many psychiatrists long suspected newer drugs that are highly promoted and widely prescribed offer few if any benefits over older medicines that sell for a fraction of the cost
3836791 this is a serious infection and soft contact lens users should be mindful of the potential to develop this problem

3836867 if not for putting that plant up there are some things we have that wouldnt be here
3836868 if not for getrag if not for linamar things would be different here these partnerships help us keep jobs here

3836872 not only is getrag hiring employees but its providing work and jobs at ktp and the casting plant and its brought suppliers

3836875 this is a new technology and we believe it will enable us to improve fuel economy

3836877 that allows space which we had no plans for to be used and its a significant section of ktp its allowing linamar to set up its own company there to set up its own offices have its own entrance were leasing the space to them and theyre using our people thats a positive and they like the business

3836911 its great for the nfl its great for the afc east and its great for cbs i know theyre ecstatic
3836912 i like the last time we played the packers if it can be like that it would be good new england won 35 0 in green bay in 2006 but he beat us in the super bowl in 96 and i remember that long pass he threw to antonio freeman that was not a great way to start i think he still has more wins against us hes one of the few active players who has more wins against us than losses i hope we can straighten that record out
3836913 as an updated version of what the marshall plan did for post war europe and the subsequent international bank for reconstruction and development world bank did for other less developed economies in asia india and others
3836914 is a misunderstood misused and under utilized legislative vehicle for the unity and development of the south south zone
3836915 rather than agreeing to contribute a small fraction of their oil and gas derivation income from source to the central nddc fund shareholders funding for the development of the south south region and the niger delta just as the federal government and the oil companies were contributing in this new partnership for development the majority of the south south state governors declined and took steps to frustrate that aspect of the nddc law instead they collected all the derivation income for oil and gas to their respective state capitals under the unbridled control of state governors
3836916 the temptation just became too much and today we are all witnesses of how this sudden floodgate of money has corrupted so many aspects of our life from the corruption of our politics and democratic elections to the cultivation of armed gangs as a sort of private army to sudden overnight extreme political wealth of a few persons that have cultivated to the decadence of our society and moral life
3836917 with the absence of the real stakeholders that is the oil producing communities and their state governments from the control room of the nddc the presidency started to see and treat the funds available to the nddc as a private or personal largesse for all kinds of irrelevant and untold purpose for instance the wedding of the presidents son or daughter or that of an influential staff of the presidency can overnight become the highest priority funding and business agenda of the nddc consequently corruption of great magnitude also found a favorable environment to grow within the management of the nddc itself
3836918 the pool of funding for the development activities of the nddc was intended to be sourced from three sources the federal the relevant states and the oil companies with the concerned states not contributing tot his central pool of funds the nddc was thus handicapped with adequate funding to do its work this failure of a fraction of the oil derivation income being available for nddcs development of the south south has become a serious dent on the nddc
3836919 by so doing we would be paying for our shareholding in the nddc just as the two other major shareholders namely federal government and the oil companies
3836920 that is those who produce more and therefore incur greater environmental degradation in their areas should receive more of the development funding of projects and personnel amongst the member states and communities
3836921 should take advantage of the bi annual council meetings of the member state governors as provided in the nddc law to promote unity amongst member states of the niger delta region
3836922 the recent call by one cynthia whyte of the joint revolutionary council for the dissolution of the board of the niger delta development commission nddc on account of alleged misconduct of the board chairman ambassador sam ede is out rightly condemnable misconceived irrational illiterate and politically motivated
3836923 the board and management of the nddc cannot and must never be collectively responsible and punished over an alleged crime committed by an individual even against his colleagues in the commission
3836924 what crime has the board and management committed to warrant such divisively political call by the said cynthia whyte whos said jrcs practical existence is in the unsure minds of the imagined woman
3836925 we join well meaning leaders of the region to call on the federal government and security agencies to disregard the ranting of cynthia whyte who though a nephew to ambassdor edem is an unfortunate introduction to the genuine struggle of the region whose contributory excesses great minds are trying to manage if there is a cynthia whyte and a jrc as claimed let the he she learn fast what patriotism means
3836926 on behalf of the joint revolutionary council comprising the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta the reformed niger delta peoples volunteer force and the martyrs brigade we herein demand within the next 144 hours the immediate and outright suspension of the entire board of the niger delta development commission nddc and the appointment of a sole administrator pending the appointment of a new board at the expiration of the tenure of the current board who will oversee the complete probe of the activities of the commission since in inception in 2000
3836927 if this demand is not followed we will not have a choice but engage in acts of strategic sabotage this is not a threat but a statement of intent
3836928 in the past few years reports of unbelievable embezzlements have been leveled against key officers of the commission and nothing has been done about these reports
3836929 the obasanjo regime overlooked these reports of corruption now president musa yaradua seems to be bent on ignoring it thanks to the efforts of babagana kingibe who seems to be reaping great compensations from the coffers of the commission
3836930 contractors who abandoned contracts such as shore protection and road projects have complained that the reason why they abandon contracts is largely because of the high kickbacks demanded by top officials of the commission
3836931 abandoned contracts litter the nooks and crannies of the various communities in the niger delta shortchanging the people of the niger delta and putting a great dent in the efforts of our people to show appreciation for successes that have been achieved thus far
3836932 the recent report of witchcraft and sorcery leveled against top management of the niger delta development commission has gone further to lend credence to the extent of wickedness greed and base avarice that continues to drive those who today govern the affairs of the commission which is supposed to provide social economic and infrastructural development to the long suffering people of the niger delta region
3836933 it has proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the management of the commission is in the hands of desperate and over ambitious people whose only concern is to enrich themselves by any means possible whether by witchcraft sorcery blackmail and threats of assassination
3836934 these people are not capable of leading development initiatives and must be brought to book immediately
3836935 we also wish to use this opportunity to dissociate ourselves from a so called training for militants said to be carried out by a fraud infested organization called the foundation for ethnic harmony in nigeria fehn
3836936 as far as we are concerned the only concern of this group is to extort monies from ignorant and uninformed corporate and private groups for their own selfish whims
3836937 the solutions lie in an honest desire by those who lord over the nigerian state to give to caesar that which belongs to caesar
3836938 we wish to commend the arewa consultative forum acf for its blunt but precise remarks about leaders of the niger delta once again leaders in the niger delta especially senior management of the niger delta development commission have proven them right shame of these leaders
3836939 the time has come for our people to rise up and call to judgment all those who continuously misappropriate the responsibilities they were given on our behalf
3836940 while we recognize that we have all sinned and come short of the glory of god it is important that those who are appointed to rule over affairs that impact directly on our lives and those of our loves ones must be above board in certain ramifications
3836941 playing monopoly with a few friends or loved ones may seem like a delightful way to spend a sunday afternoon but its not after 12 hours of bailing yourself out of jail and paying imaginary taxes you simply don t give an armadillo s hiney if someone lands on your precious boardwalk hotel

3837028 first of all russia will never invade ukraine not even for sevastopol this thesis is ridiculous for many reasons we shouldnt draw such conclusions from the ongoing russia georgia conflict its too different
3837029 i agree that under certain circumstances a russian invasion of ukraine is possible thats why ukraine should be more serious about maintaining the balanced and friendly relations with our eastern neighbor in order to avoid the risk
3837030 what made you think that russia will start an aggressive action on our territory the pathetic situation in ossetia does not indicate anything in this case
3837031 i think ukraine is absolutely capable of protecting its interests if such a danger arrives our country does not even need natos assistance ukraine has enough resources to stand up for itself

3837033 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3837034 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas

3837041 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

3837043 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3837044 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3837045 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3837093 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

3837108 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos

3837117 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3837125 jack abramoff is an orthodox jew and i am a christian
3837126 was do you want to have republicans lined up with a group that has these values
3837127 a ppealing to the lowest instinct rather than the highest in the america psyche
3837128 inundated the country with fundraising appeals that tear apart the ethic of tolerance which binds our society together ust as moon attempts to influence the young by offering simplistic allegiance to himself the father as a pallative to the anxiety endemic to modern society
3837129 whether the republican party returns to its traditions re establishing itself as a party of rights and pragmatism or adopts an agenda catalyzed by moon and richard viguerie becoming instead a party of anger and socialized values
3837130 a party basing its appeal on old fashioned patriotism and family values simply cannot justify an alliance with a cult that preys on the disintegration of the american family and advocates allegiance to an international social order operating with cell like secrecy
3837131 this relay was still a very good relay i know you always want to have medals hanging around your necks they have to award the effort but we just took two seconds off our national record and if you look back that time would have put us on top of the podium in athens
3837132 everybodys racing everybodys competing were having a great meet and were showing that we belong on this stage
3837133 in past games that effort would have been good enough for the podium
3837134 i think we learned a lot here about what it takes at this level this stage we werent good enough
3837135 ill take all the deservedly so the responsibility of us not winning thats the situation im in and the position i have
3837136 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
3837137 no discuten las medidas de seguridad adoptadas para individuos en particular
3837138 tampoco hablamos ha a adido el portavoz policial de las comunicaciones que mantenemos con otras fuerzas de seguridad o autoridades estatales es un asunto demasiado delicado
3837139 no one gave us a chance in the beginning saying we werent going to advance
3837140 we improved each game and the bond and chemistry we developed as players in such a short amount of time is something special
3837141 what are the risks associated with the use of fosamax

3837149 the seniors are great they are wonderful they have more energy than you would imagine
3837150 i knitted all my children their sweaters and i knitted things for my grandchildren
3837151 i enjoy it in fact i also enjoy the friendship
3837152 we come here as much to knit as we come to gab

3837156 i think the concept of operation immortality is incredibly exciting
3837157 ive done a lot of interesting things in my life but this certainly ranks up there as the most unique im honored to be included on the immortality drive and look forward to being part of richard garriotts fascinating trip to the iss
3837158 the immortality drive wouldnt be complete without the dna from a human physical specimen and who better to fit that bill than the blue print himself matt morgan
3837159 im thrilled that matt is on board and that an american gladiator will be making the trip with me to space
3837160 shes been such a good dog i knew that if she was there she was doing her best to take care of jake
3837161 it was a relief to know that theres an end and that we still have a part of jake
3837162 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3837163 we need to put some weight on her shes a big dog and looks too skinny
3837164 die unsere besondere autonomie die von mehreren staatspr sidenten als solche anerkannt worden ist beschneiden oder aush hlen wollen nach dem zweiten weltkrieg haben wird die selbstbestimmung gefordert letztendlich haben wir die autonomie als kompromiss akzeptiert jenen die uns auf das niveau der regionen mit normalstatut bringen m chten sage ich wir lassen nicht mit uns spa en wenn das passiert werden wir die selbstbestimmung verlangen

3837170 en muchos pa ses pobres las condiciones de refrigeraci n que requieren las vacunas existentes son costosas y dif ciles de obtener
3837171 as mismo a menudo es dif cil mantener est riles las agujas y las jeringas en esos pa ses
3837172 otro aspecto que limita el xito de estas vacunas es la necesidad de que las personas retornen para recibir las tres dosis requeridas actualmente
3837173 nuestros resultados indican que la inmunizaci n sin aguja que usa una combinaci n de nanoemulsi n y el ant geno de la hepatitis b podr a ser una vacuna segura y eficaz contra la hepatitis y que tambi n proporciona un m todo alternativo de refuerzo de las vacunas existentes
3837174 theyre great for their intended uses but theyre not for everyone
3837175 the main star of burn is of course la jenna who is featured here having actual sex with former hubby justin sterling along with a pile of her beautiful costars that is when shes not getting spanked and flogged by them too the film and yes did we mention that it was actually shot on film also stars new mom taylor rain getting the fucking of her young life from evan stone the sorely missed lauren phoenix in a powerful pairing with mr marcus the fondly remembered cytheria squirting up a storm and a sapphic interlude wherein justine joli lap away at jennas famous privates
3837176 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3837177 c isnt special to the rest of the world he is only special to you he is a burden to the rest of the world and if he was another part of nature like an autistic fish for example would have died long ago you just use others to keep him alive
3837178 die sozialdemokraten brauchten mal einen festen tritt in den hintern die haben jahrelang angst vor unangenehmen wahrheiten gehabt und stattdessen das politisch korrekte institutionalisiert
3837179 the consumer is still under enormous pressure as employment is declining real wages are down housing and stock market wealth are down and credit conditions continue to tighten
3837180 this data is consistent with our bearish forecast of personal consumption throughout the second half of 2008
3837181 going forward a tight credit environment a deteriorating labor sector and elevated prices will act as a significant constraint on consumption
3837182 there is potential inflation outside of oil and the credit markets get a little nervous when they believe that food and energy price inflation might spread
3837183 and we are very pleased that virgin and others are prepared to offer them

3837186 i will be teaching a basic jin shin do class again beginning in january
3837187 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3837188 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3837189 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
3837190 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
3837191 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
3837192 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
3837193 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
3837194 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
3837195 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
3837196 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
3837197 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
3837198 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
3837199 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
3837200 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
3837201 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3837202 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3837203 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
3837204 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
3837205 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3837206 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
3837207 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
3837208 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case
3837209 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these
3837210 the margins on cellphones are normally pretty healthy for retailers
3837211 but apple controls the iphone and it is a phone that people want to buy
3837212 i dont think they are going to try to do the bait and switch
3837213 and even if they were the customer that comes in asking for an iphone doesnt want the treo or the instinct they want the iphone so its an incremental sale for them

3837224 almost anything you do on a long term basis even something as commonplace as gardening can become a practice spiritual soulful enriching it is a practice to develop a communion with everything in your garden so that your roses for example are treated not as mere objects but as honored guests at the banquet of your life but if you garden primarily to impress the neighbors or win prizes with your roses then you are not engaged in a practice paradoxically the person who gardens as a practice for the sheer love of it is probably the one who will impress the neighbors and win prizes
3837225 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3837226 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3837227 the car was clearly marked they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in humanitarian community in afghanistan
3837228 since they oppose the current government they also oppose those who work with it
3837229 and unfortunately they dont differentiate among armed multinational forces security contractors and humanitarian groups
3837230 the irc provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3837231 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3837232 abuse doesnt really need much space to thrive and it needs even less to occur only once
3837233 ni single board rio delivered all the components we needed for a reliable high performance embedded system on a single device which streamlined development and drastically reduced costs
3837234 we were able to start with labview and compactrio for prototyping and quickly migrate our code to the new ni single board rio for deployment all in less than a year
3837235 this is a tripartite negotiating framework you cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree
3837236 the political impasse will only be broken when we have an agreement that reflects the will of the people as expressed in the march election i wouldnt agree to any side deal
3837237 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
3837238 we will not betray you in this respect the mdc entered these negotiations full of hope we put aside our grievances and reached out to zanu pf for the good of the people
3837239 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3837240 its a bad omen when the tank doesnt have it
3837241 however it becomes a lot more work for everyone when you are pugged with a tank you have never worked with before and they are not running any type of threat meter
3837242 in a tight fight drop a freezing trap in front of the healer to buy the tank an extra 30 secs
3837243 if the tank asks you to pull and will taunt it off you open with the larger of the shots rather than autoshot followed by arcane shot after the tank taunts
3837244 cultural undercurrent that betrays human decency at the most fundamental levels
3837245 doses used are higher than any i have seen in many other facilities across the country
3837246 with over a decade of leadership in high speed signal integrity serdes and cdr technologies vitesse is uniquely qualified to deliver this product
3837247 by incorporating vitesses patented vscope waveform viewing technology into high speed links this solution creates a new category for innovative serdes technology that enables advanced levels of signal integrity quality and remote monitoring
3837248 engineers have told us that they need greater performance capability and versatility from a signal source to keep pace with the latest technology
3837249 tektronix designed the awg b series to minimize complexity for users and to provide the performance needed to match increasing high speed serial data rates and the advance of wideband digital rf technologies the awg b series can create replicate or generate virtually any signal and also has the ability to generate up to six signals simultaneously on the awg7000b series no other awg can match the performance capability and flexibility of the tektronix awg b series
3837250 increased alcohol outcomes among reserve guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance on these forces
3837251 active duty marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems
3837252 women were significantly more likely to start drinking heavily but less likely to start binge drinking or have alcohol related problems compared with men which may be due to women turning to drinking as a coping mechanism whereas men may have a higher propensity for risk taking behaviors
3837253 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3837254 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
3837255 in this case it was determined that we need to move forward in a timely fashion
3837256 two factors appear to be at play in shifting voter sentiment
3837257 first mccain is garnering more support from his base including republicans and white evangelical protestants than he was in june and he also has steadily gained backing from white working class voters over this period secondly and more generally the arizona senator has made gains on his leadership image an even greater percentage of voters than in june now see mccain as the candidate who would use the best judgment in a crisis and an increasing percentage see him as the candidate who can get things done
3837258 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3837259 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3837260 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3837261 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3837262 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3837263 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3837264 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3837265 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed
3837266 i do not see there is anything wrong with it
3837267 you have to be sure that the performers and the song it is at the highest level
3837268 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect
3837269 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3837270 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3837271 in the face of all those who are manipulating its security and stability
3837272 i think it wasnt our day but the kids gave it 100 percent we just had two big falls we had to handle the chinese had an excellent day and they deserved to win
3837273 i think it wasnt our day but the kids gave it 100 percent we just had two big falls we had to handle the chinese had an excellent day and they deserved to win
3837274 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3837275 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3837276 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances its not too bad i guess
3837277 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay
3837278 its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together
3837279 wow i think this is the first time i have wiped at the stairs
3837280 skinning and lw on the druid bear you need that to make the epics
3837281 yeah but you can make gear you need and it skills you up
3837282 what can i make that is better than drops at the different levels all the way up to 70
3837283 are there any bop crafted leathers that precede level 59 requirements
3837284 so level 59 is the first time in lw that i can wear a bop
3837285 so i dont need to have lw until level 59 then
3837286 and if i keep selling the mining results i can afford better gear through ah or loot drops or use the skinning mats profits to have some other lw craft me gear 1 59 plus i can afford the 40 mount and the 60 mount and all the skills 1 60
3837287 the entire angel flight world is saddened and surprised and shocked that this is happening all at once
3837288 is there any commonality its just so strange to have this happen after such a long history
3837289 the plane just did a nosedive straight down to the pavement
3837290 joe was a big volunteer in town he was somebody that understood the process of town government any time any of us had a question about how government worked he certainly had the answer most times
3837291 while some are speculating about cyber warfare and state sponsorship we have no data to indicate anything of the sort at this time we are seeing some botnets some well known and some not so well known take aim at georgia websites these attacks were mostly tcp syn floods with one tcp rst flood in the mix no icmp or udp floods detected here these attacks were all globally sourced suggesting a botnet or multiple botnets were behind them
3837292 all of these are http floods ie rapid fire get requests
3837293 why have these new attacks been classified as incidents of cyberwarfare when so many attacks that came before them were not
3837294 i havent lost to him in six matches since the olympic games
3837295 hes always dangerous you can see how hard he hits the ball
3837296 obviously roger is going to go in as the favorite but thats why we go out there and play
3837297 hes gotten me every time so far but every time at the beginning of each match ive felt like i could come out on top if hes too good for me hes too good for me but i know i have a chance to get into the medal round tomorrow
3837298 it was in the middle of the first set i missed so many shots and i was not playing anywhere near the way i was practicing so it was just kind of frustrating to have practiced so well and to come out and do the total opposite
3837299 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3837300 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3837301 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3837302 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3837303 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3837304 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3837305 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well
3837306 the latest economic analysis from pricewaterhousecoopers estimates that the irish economy is headed for a sharp slowdown in 2008 and has little scope for any significant recovery in 2009 growth in ireland is expected to slip to 2 in 2008 and remain fairly subdued in 2009 as the economy suffers from subdued domestic and foreign demand during both years

3837316 its important to rule out the learning problems the emotional behavioral issues adjustment concerns whether its a change to a new school or there might be changes in the family divorces deaths things like that
3837317 she told me she was borderline adhd and we were going to go ahead and treat her with 5 milligrams of adderall
3837318 it was upsetting me because it was like she was drunk she was moving really slow and just lethargic just not samantha
3837319 it made me just want to sit down in one place
3837320 we did full cognitive battery of tests to rule out some of those other areas like learning disabilities or behavior problems she did very well in testing performed within the expected range no evidence of any cognitive impairment and from what i saw at least in a one on one setting she was certainly able to hold her attention and perform really well
3837321 its important to rule out the learning problems the emotional behavioral issues adjustment concerns whether its a change to a new school or there might be changes in the family divorces deaths things like that
3837322 they help me learn how to take the right notes and learn how to study right
3837323 i worked with her teacher and her counselor at school she has taught samantha how to organize her not only her book bag her desk but her thoughts
3837324 shes not struggling like she was last year she doesnt hate school anymore shes not even the same child she was last year
3837325 studies show that children that are involved in activities and have less time on their hands tend to stay away from drugs easier than kids than kids that have nothing to do after school
3837326 i mean it started off only on weekends when i was twelve but by thirteen i was like i need to get high man
3837327 studies show that children that are involved in activities and have less time on their hands tend to stay away from drugs easier than kids than kids that have nothing to do after school
3837328 look real carefully at what their teenagers are doing they need to see how involved they are in activities and if they are not what are they doing with their time
3837329 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
3837330 of course the mainstream media ignored this development leaving it to the blogosphere to bring the big money and big pressure of the psi lobby to light
3837331 i think that my parents think that my brother just because hes a boy is smarter than me
3837332 they automatically assume that since youre a girl you cant handle the complications that you may run into with math or science
3837333 well like hell use scientific terms and big words with my brother but hell talk to me like i dont know words that are bigger than four letters
3837334 its hard because its not just your parents not just your brother and sisters its society they think that girls arent supposed to do as well as boys do in math or science
3837335 the damage is not irreparable but it is something that kind of plants that seed that its not for me
3837336 please be careful what you say to the daughters make sure you provide them with the same kinds of opportunities even the toys that we buy them actually signal that i dont expect youll do any erector set building or any of those things those are for the boys
3837337 i think thats definitely a big part of it to prove to people that i can be good at this i can do this just as good as any male can
3837338 she was red instantly and she threw up it was just too much for her
3837339 so what that means is that theyre going to absorb more heat from the environment
3837340 another issue is that children produce more heat so each pound of child produces more heat energy than one pound of adult
3837341 the other thing that is probably the most important thing
3837342 is that children do not sweat effectively they really dont sweat effectively until after going through puberty and sweating is the most important way that we use to control our temperature
3837343 she was just running around playing being a two year old you know she just hit that wall and she threw up she just got overheated she was red instantly and she threw up it was just too much for her
3837344 to be honest with you children may not demonstrate symptoms until theyre in a lot of trouble so you really want to use more prevention and just limit the amount of time and exercise try and limit it to times of the day when its not so hot
3837345 and its not just one blow its the back and forth where the brain is bouncing on one portion of the skull and then another portion of the skull
3837346 i think it was about 6 oclock i got a call and it was him telling me i need to get home something was wrong with the baby
3837347 im just seeing a lot of dark area thats damaged brain right in there thats not getting any blood supply
3837348 and its not just one blow its the back and forth where the brain is bouncing on one portion of the skull and then another portion of the skull
3837349 now its ok a lot of times to hold a baby and pat em
3837350 but if you have this baby and shake and shake and shake like that trying to calm them down thats probably still too much so just some gentle shaking and rocking is ok but not the heavy shaking
3837351 i was hurt hurt and angry at the same time but i was more hurt because that was my son
3837352 and then theyll confess well i did shake him a little they just dont realize what this does to small child
3837353 never ever shake a baby stop lay the baby down go get help call anybody get a neighbor get a friend anybody and say i need help right now
3837354 harmy knows now what is best for him and surely they should know by now that the only way he gets up to his standards is to bowl
3837355 he has been instrumental in growing ihrsa and being a trusted resource for our members we will miss him but we are excited for him and his new venture he brings an entrepreneurial spirit and ability to identify growth opportunities to this new company and we wish him much success
3837356 successively he led membership sales booth sales ad sales and sponsorship sales in each area he surpassed everyones expectations plus he helped develop many of ihrsas current superstars leaders such as michele eynon tom hunt and lynne fussteig
3837357 chuck leves work with john mccarthy cemented the existence and future of an organization that has changed is changing and will continue to change for the better the lives of millions
3837358 ive spent the last 27 years helping to build ihrsa and the fitness industry and it has been a tremendously satisfying run
3837359 i hope ive added value for all the people and companies with whom ive worked and i know my customers will be in good hands with the tremendous ihrsa staff and will continue reaping the rewards ihrsa brings them id also like to thank john mccarthy for his 25 years of leadership and inspiration and joe moore for making this transition possible the consumer fitness association will provide benefits and services to healthy lifestyle consumers and will be complementary to ihrsa

3837432 i think there ought to be some serious discussion by smart people really smart people about whether or not proliferation of things like the smoking gun and tmz and youtube and the whole celebrity culture is healthy weve switched from a culture that was interested in manufacturing economics politics trying to play a serious part in the world to a culture thats really entertainment based and the guy says to me the nightline guy i didnt get the guys name if we didnt cover cultural things we wouldnt be covering you and the mist and promoting the movie and im like britney spears and lindsay lohan arent cultural they arent political theyre economic only in the mildest sense of the word in fact if i had to pick somebody some celebrity who has had some impact this year some sort of echo in the larger american life i would say hannah montana but britney britney spears is just trailer trash

3837436 it probably will were a bit radioactive because it has a subtext about homosexuality and its set in the fifties so they bandy about a lot of pejorative words that were common coinage back then but tennessee williams got away with it
3837437 we feel the star is paying the price for johnston presss greedy spending spree over the last few years and bad decisions taken by senior management
3837438 the company relies on the goodwill loyalty and dedication of its staff who earn meagre salaries well below the national average wage
3837439 our staff have put in many dedicated years of service around the clock and this is how they are repaid
3837440 we believe the way to sell more newspapers is to invest in editorial content rather than employ a skeleton staff and we will fight these cuts
3837441 the printing press in upper mounts in northampton is used by 39 other johnston press titles printing more than one million copies a week
3837442 following a detailed review of the printing press operations within johnston press it is proposed to close the printing operation in northampton and to reduce the printing operation in peterborough
3837443 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy and by re deployment to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
3837444 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
3837445 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective
3837446 regretfully the proposals put at risk of redundancy up to 30 posts in these areas and we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3837447 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3837448 our members in johnston press want to produce high quality local papers but they are finding they have to work incredibly long hours sometimes dangerously long hours in order to do so
3837449 onj is a condition in which the bone tissue in the jaw fails to heal after minor trauma such as a tooth extraction causing the bone to be exposed
3837450 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3837451 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3837452 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3837453 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3837454 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3837455 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3837456 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3837457 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3837458 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3837459 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers
3837460 als er meer nodig is om het gebruikers gemakkelijker te maken hun profiel te wissen zullen we andere oplossingen uitproberen
3837461 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3837462 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3837463 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3837464 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3837465 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3837466 this may be news to some but touchscreens have been around a lot longer than the damn iphone
3837467 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3837468 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
3837469 in der marketing und kommunikationsbranche gibt es besonders viele fachblogs zumindest ist dies mein eindruck interessant einmal nachzufragen warum sie gestartet wurden und was sie bringen deswegen werfe ich ein st ckchen in die blogger runde und frage nach beweggr nden und ergebnissen
3837470 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network

3837472 we would love to raise money for a candidate from tennessee but there isnt one running during this cycle

3837487 i think as evident today our no 2 offense was horrific in spots against the no 1 defense im disappointed today in that but all in all ive seen a lot of positive things but we have a lot of work to do we have some tough decisions to make some of the decisions will be made by the players thats why we practice the way we do

3837536 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
3837537 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
3837538 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
3837539 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
3837540 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
3837541 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
3837542 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
3837543 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
3837544 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration
3837545 distilling subject concepts from opencyc vol b1 overview and methodology
3837546 theyre great for their intended uses but theyre not for everyone

3837549 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3837550 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3837551 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3837552 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3837553 because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3837554 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3837555 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3837556 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else

3837564 everyone talks about all the data thats being created and how valuable it is but the way you make it available is by doing something actionable with it
3837565 we are really fascinated with data and the ability to use it to increase effective cost per thousand for ads theres this explosion of inventory but people havent figured out how to monetize it yet data will be the difference
3837566 on the verge of exploding in the next two years
3837567 the iphone introduction has begun to cause a shakeup that is long overdue in mobileland

3837578 these sites are being destroyed left and right especially in asia where theres been a lot of growth so they just wipe them out
3837579 a lot of them just dont realize that their grandkids could be making thousands of dollars on this type of thing
3837580 if you take advantage of one of these sites and develop it responsibly youre going to be bringing thousands of people out of poverty

3837610 the christian on his knees sees more than the philosopher on tiptoe
3837611 it is good for a man to quietly wait for the salvation of the lord
3837612 it all became clear when we found a general services administration gsa bulletin titled b 7 radio frequency identification blatantly directing heads of federal agencies to consider action that can be taken to advance the rfid industry by demonstrating the long term intent of the agency to adopt rfid technological solutions apparently since the spychippers knew they couldnt get consumers to sign on they switched tactics to getting government agencies on board instead
3837613 taxpayers have little say in the day to day purchasing decisions of federal agencies so it was the perfect place to land high profit and lucrative contracts right over the heads of the public
3837614 as we know from the confidential documents we uncovered the rfid industry has long been planning to use top tier government officials to advance its agenda apparently those efforts are now paying off not only is the gsa openly supporting rfid but u s senators are getting on board too rather than looking out for the interest of their constituents our elected representatives are working overtime to protect and promote the interests of the rfid industry
3837615 one pro rfid government missive to leave us reeling came from something called the senator republican high tech task force which unveiled a set of policy programs in the spring of 2005
3837616 we were disturbed when we took a closer look at this task force of elected officials its website describes it as a conduit for the technology industry but wait a minute we didnt elect these senators to represent the industry we elected them to represent us
3837617 when did politicians become lackeys for industry instead of conduits for the people caspian doesnt generally advocate legislative controls over rfid we want labeling legislation only as we describe in chapter seventeen but we certainly dont think it is appropriate for our elected representatives to gush about the technology calling it exciting either were betting the lawmakers exuberance will subside once their constituents read this book and learn that the exciting new technologies their politicians are pushing involve orwellian style privacy invasions
3837618 there will always be those who believe the potential societal benefits of surveillance schemes outweigh the risks of abuse however though there is ample evidence that the supposed security benefits of mass surveillance are quite doubtful the risks of unchecked government control are very real and not to be discounted as the police and other agents of the state increasingly tap into the power of the retail sectors growing arsenal of sophisticated surveillance technologies we may soon find ourselves in the totalitarian nightmare described by george orwell in 1984
3837619 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
3837620 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
3837621 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
3837622 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
3837623 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
3837624 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
3837625 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
3837626 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
3837627 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
3837628 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
3837629 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
3837630 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
3837631 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
3837632 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
3837633 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
3837634 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

3837661 bioreactors are now being used at dozens of locations which show that naturally occurring microorganisms concentrated in state of the art bioreactors can effectively clean contaminated groundwater sites
3837662 the bioreactor groundwater treatment technology developed by eri and uc davis includes an aboveground tank containing trillions of microorganisms primarily bacteria that attach themselves to the surfaces of fine grains of sand the grains are distributed throughout the tank by the upward flow of the water passing through the tank for treatment as the contaminated water mixes with them the microorganisms consume mtbe and other dissolved gasoline components as food during the waters 20 minute journey through the bioreactor the microorganisms destroy the gasoline chemicals converting them to carbon dioxide and water thus eliminating the contamination
3837663 they are investigating the possible cause so they can address the situation of what it is what caused the contamination
3837664 once it was determined there was a problem and that there would have to be public notice it took time to marshal the forces and plan what they were going to do

3838011 fast forward 10 years later wwe is now a publicly traded company it is responsible to its shareholders and therefore must react to market conditions and influences much differently than when it was a privately held company while the chairman can stack the deck with a board of directors and executive management team that looks more like a friends and family reunion than anything else should the irs determine that wwes contracted talent are employees and not independent contractors there is the potential for significant fines expenses and cost of doing business on a go forward basis that could have a serious negative impact on wwe stock

3838166 there are a few unfair holes the 17th is extremely unfair i couldnt hit a better shot i cut a three iron straight up in the air as good as i can hit it it pitches 15 feet short of the hole and runs over the back dead
3838167 i didnt seem to get much out of my game today i played good played really good and hit a lot of fairways and a lot of solid iron shots
3838168 i seemed to get on the wrong side of the pin a lot and had to get defensive on the greens i didnt really hole much
3838169 i hit probably my only bad iron shot of the day on the 16th and i can accept bogey there i hit a great three iron to 17 and it runs over the back and i make bogey
3838170 and the 18th is just a tough hole it was a bad finish and it is obviously disappointing it could have been a lot better because i played good
3838171 it was tough unfortunately if you spray it wide you are okay but six inches and a foot off the fairway isnt it is a shame never mind we will try again tomorrow
3838172 i was happy to break 80 after being seven over after 12 holes

3838195 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3838196 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3838197 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values

3838206 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3838207 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation

3838257 i think what bernie mac did that few if any have been able to do was become a success here in chicago
3838258 most of our homegrown talent has to go to l a or new york to become famous but bernie he was selling out the chicago theater before he went out to new york thats next to impossible
3838259 whats interesting about bernies career is that he wasnt a mainstream comic at first his act was very edgy and very raw
3838260 bernie would talk about things that other black comics wouldnt talk about like skin color and how being a very dark skinned black man like him made his life very different from other peoples
3838261 he didnt so much cross over as people crossed over to him
3838262 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
3838263 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there
3838264 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them
3838265 youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
3838266 people tried to imitate his style his gestures or how he bugged his eyes out when he got to the punch line thats a bernie mac trait
3838267 someone just cant have that he took it as he ran with it
3838268 what he achieved even at a later age has been inspiring

3838319 not only are most corporations not paying income tax but multinational companies that relocate american jobs overseas dont have to pay taxes on the income that those foreign workers generate
3838320 washington has to get its priorities straight we should be granting tax breaks to companies that keep jobs right here on american soil
3838321 there is clearly a lack of accountability in washington which is one of the main reasons i am running for the u s senate

3838359 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3838360 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3838361 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3838362 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3838363 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3838364 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3838365 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3838366 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3838367 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3838368 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3838369 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3838370 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3838373 failure to stop at a traffic accident resulting in death
3838374 following the deaths last month in separate traffic accidents of a bicyclist and a man using a wheelchair i was incensed to read comments from a south bend police department spokesman tribune july 25 who said the accident involving the wheelchair user was just bad luck and bad timing

3838378 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3838379 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3838380 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3838381 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3838382 when listing vehiclesfor sale on ebay motors this decision has been made in order to protect our buyers from unwanted solicitations and fraud attempts we reserve the right to end any auction early so please act fast
3838383 at other moments in our history maybe we look back and we think they were more serene but at this moment i think its very very critical for catholics to take very seriously their responsibility to be active citizens and to bring the values and the virtues of our faith into the public square and into the public debate its going to be critical in terms of how the church and other christians other believers are able to operate in this society if we are not vigilant at this moment
3838384 we cant allow ourselves to be intimidated by them and we need to exercise our rights and our freedom of speech
3838385 because those that advocate for the freedom of speech on many many fronts when it comes to the churchs voice they try to silence it
3838386 i think that they either purposely or unintentionally confuse the issues certainly a catholic in public life should not be trying to impose doctrines of belief and faith on others so what we believe about the eucharist or what we believe about the teaching authority of the bishops or the pope these are not things that we should be attempting to enshrine in law thats what is legitimately meant about separation of church and state
3838387 but i think where the confusion comes in the politicians that i think youre referring to they bring these objections up on not issues of doctrine but of moral values which also coincide with fundamental human rights
3838388 when you talk about protecting innocent human life this is something that we need to do as human beings and the fact that the church has a voice on this issue and a position on this issue doesnt mean its an imposing of our beliefs or values anymore than the effort to break down segregation by the church was an effort to impose some kind of religious doctrine on the culture or society but it was us standing up for a fundamental human right
3838389 our strong catholic faith teaches us the importance of treating all of gods children with love and respect it also teaches us that marriage between a man and a woman is the foundation of the family the first school of love peace and justice
3838390 the ruling by the california supreme court nullifying the legal definition of marriage in state law was a shock to catholics and other citizens who are concerned about how this will affect their own childrens understanding of marriage
3838391 the fight to protect marriage is an all encompassing effort that affects everyone in california
3838392 were honored to have catholics for protectmarriage com offer us their assistance and to add them to our diverse list of supporters we expect they will help us motivate a groundswell of support for proposition and were confident that with that support we will restore the definition of marriage in california come november
3838393 as these opportunities for intimate relationships increase the boundary between platonic and romantic feelings blurs and becomes easier to cross
3838394 para los que creen que la tarea de los futuros gobiernos o de ste si decidiera comenzar a gobernar con seriedad es sencilla los invito a comparar la econom a argentina post convertibilidad con la de la d cada de los ochentas si observan bien la nica diferencia entre la econom a de aquellos a os y la que tenemos ahora es la bendici n que significan los t rminos del intercambio y la calidad de la infraestructura que se cre en los a os 90 en todos los dem s aspectos particularmente los que tienen que ver con la organizaci n de nuestra econom a estamos tan mal como en los a os 80

3838396 the fact that we have been successful with this bid is a very firm indication of the high regard that the government has for dundee as far as travel issues are concerned
3838397 we have been leading the way with initiatives to encourage less use of cars by for example bringing in millions of pounds to improve public transport and this latest funding means we will be able with our partners to continue to make improvements that will have a very real effect on peoples lives
3838398 the councils bid for dundee to become a smarter choices smarter places city will be delivered through a project called dundee health central
3838399 the project will be delivered over a three year period and the cycle hire scheme similar to those run in cities such as london paris and barcelona is one of a number of initiatives designed to encourage healthy living by cycling and walking within our communities and using the facilities within them rather than using the car which obviously has worthwhile environmental benefits

3838643 we had over 300 people come and weve been putting the stuff up
3838644 the idea was to put some of the theory into practice
3838645 it felt like we had gone to a lot of panels and talked but there wasnt enough outside of individuals trying things so we thought we could leverage the opportunities we have and start to experiment with opportunities for filmmakers
3838646 i think were taking a good first step for the open source movement
3838647 the reality of the marketplace is that its really fragmented people arent really sure what they should do and theyre still trying to adhere to traditional models that arent really applicable anymore theyre getting some control back so its stripping away some of the permission based culture thats surrounded filmmaking
3838648 i give my time because i believe what were laying the groundwork for now could be the business model in a few years
3838649 its about seizing control for ourselves in some way hopefully something will come out of that

3838683 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3838684 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations

3838779 ive already said that in accordance with the united nations code we are trying to force georgia which started the aggression to peace we find this tactic very effective and the only possible one i want to remind you that history has seen many examples of pacification by the aggressor in this way western countries did it seventy years ago and you know the tragic consequences of it i mean the lessons of the munich agreement of 1938
3838780 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war and it is so obvious that the world has to react there is no way georgian people would ever live with occupation and annexation
3838781 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the twenty first century
3838782 what is going on there is so far beyond what the general public around the world is allowed to see you can not not react with compassion and pity for what the individuals of gaza is going through i want to reach there all of us desperately hope that there will be humanitarian aid increase and a port opened for these people to be able to go in and out of this giant open air prison
3838783 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life

3838785 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real

3838788 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3838789 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3838790 georgia is in the middle of a war and they are in 10th place

3838795 we will use for the oa album some studio techniques shared by producer roy z bruce dickinson judas priest halford on his last brazilian visit and the expactation of course is to obtain an excepcional result for this project
3838796 after extense research we decided to work with gus and his studio because of its extreme musical refinement and its experience on working with high level productions in fact these points are requirements and needs for our songs since we work with a lot of musical elements and its not that simple to make all of this sound good clear and in accordance of what we idealize for the album as a final result

3838798 you take a formula and then you corrupt the formula
3838799 the eu cannot accept such developments in neighboring countries and it must not look on without doing something it must make a clear statement addressed to russia and in a second step it must think about what contribution the eu could make towards securing the peacefire in georgia its doubtful whether the eu will be able to reach a consensus on this but if the required unified action were again to fall victim to the strategic interests of individual eu members that would be a further victory for moscow
3838800 the west would be well advised to get used to the idea that moscow no longer shies away from military action in pursuing its interests that forces the eu to define its foreign policy lines more clearly should a country like georgia that is of strategic importance to the west as a transit country for oil and gas be left to russia the eu will have to tackle these uncomfortable questions and even more uncomfortable answers if it ever wants to be more than a superfluous mediator in the step by step restoration of the russian empire
3838801 the battle for a wretched mountain region in the caucasus has created a new world order after deluding itself for too long the west now rapidly needs to find a convincing stance for dealing with a resurgent russia that no longer just rattles its sabre but makes use of it as well
3838802 the west must find a clear language for addressing moscow after hesitating for days george w bush found strong words and branded the russian attack on a sovereign neighboring state as unacceptable in the 21st century but the admonition of the outgoing american president wont have much impact in moscow firstly the russian leadership doesnt see itself as morally accountable to the iraq warrior bush secondly its waiting to see who will be moving into the white house republican hawk john mccain who wants to throw russia out of the g8 group of leading industrial nations or the young democrat barack obama who has made more moderate noises
3838803 theres a big risk that unclear signals may be misunderstood by moscow in this situation
3838804 ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract and i will play out my days at chelsea it has taken a while to get the deal done and there has been a big of compromise on both sides

3838811 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3838812 we were appealing to everybody in the international community including russia saying stop that unfortunately no help came
3838813 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by

3838989 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3838990 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3838991 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3838992 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3838993 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3838994 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3838995 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3838996 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
3838997 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
3838998 there is an unbelievable amount of uncertainty there are really a bunch of crosswinds blowing around
3838999 the reality is the leading sectors the sectors that have been strong this year are in correction its kind of a weird situation i cant remember seeing that before
3839000 i dont know where the bottom is in oil and these other commodities but if you look at some of the supply demand stuff going on i think the odds are youre going to see a rebound in commodity prices
3839001 was primarily the result of advertising revenue growth in the classified category
3839002 overall revenue growth for the quarter was lower than we were expecting largely the result of lower spending levels by some of our national advertisers
3839003 given the uncertain economic outlook our initial full year advertising revenue growth forecast of between two and three per cent is less likely to be achieved
3839004 these low prices however were partially offset by significantly higher prices available from other smaller domestic customers more in line with the movement in the international thermal coal price being experienced
3839005 a material contract ends on dec 31 the termination of this contract will allow the corporation to take advantage of the strong coal market in which it operates
3839006 its maybe the most bullish report weve seen all year just in terms of a one week surprise
3839007 demand destruction is a pretty significant fact in the us and oecd
3839008 so i think it looks as though you are starting to see the impact of higher prices
3839009 our focus right now is on getting gasoline production to return and to get product into our sites any other issues that we have to address well look at down the line
3839010 it would be inconceivable to expect any refiner to have multimillions of dollars of extra plant sitting idle to await those rare occurrences
3839011 remediation and dewatering of the no 1 shaft had been progressing smoothly up to this point
3839012 an inflow at this rate is disappointing but our remediation plan as approved by our joint venture partners recognized the risk and included specific actions to be taken at various levels of inflow
3839013 i am also pleased with the pace of development at our us projects the progress made in disposing of non core assets and the conclusion of a credit facility

3839015 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3839016 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3839017 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3839018 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3839019 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3839020 hola me gusta mucho realizar sesiones fotogr ficas me encanta bailar e ir de compras dame tu voto si
3839021 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3839022 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3839025 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3839026 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners

3839388 i would expect a change of course in monetary policy to occur sooner rather than later even in the face of an anemic economy if inflation grows
3839389 the word that seems to be coming down to them is the rates are the lowest theyre going to get and theyd better jump now that seems to be the consensus

3839410 what do you get when you put together domino json dojo or your favorite toolkit photoshop viktor and too much red bull
3839411 one thing we wanted to play with was what if the x men lived somewhere where they werent feared and hated and theyre instead celebrated and embraced
3839412 san francisco honors and celebrates diverse cultures and there are few more unique and diverse than the x men when the fires of anti mutant hysteria get restoked the city continues to embrace them and when the rest of the world starts to turn against the x men their new home stays with them
3839413 the move to san francisco also fits with where the marvel universe has been going lately
3839414 plus theres a giant dreaming celestial standing in golden gate park
3839415 san francisco is really a new team member in a lot of ways
3839416 the flavor of the city its history the people the really diverse ethnic groups cultures and religions are going to influence the book im doing a colossus story that takes place in the old russian neighborhoods colossus goes out one night looking for some home cooking finds it and gets tied into a big adventure its the kind of story we couldnt do when he lived in a mansion in upstate new york
3839417 the marin headlands is a gift from our editor axel alonso who is a san francisco kid through and through
3839418 its basically an area of old military bases built into the mountains of marin they were gun batteries and observation posts during the second world war and theyre still there its also one of the most beautiful locales on earth its home to spectacular sunsets and incredible views its a beautiful piece of land right there overlooking the bay
3839419 its a lot of different stuff an embassy a sanctuary a community center a school and a museum its a cultural headquarters but its also a secret superhero headquarters since its ten times as big underground than it is above
3839420 theres very much a public face thats manifested through the building which as youll see in issue 501 they come to call graymalkin
3839421 inevitably the x men are going to have to walk it like theyve been talking it
3839422 theres not many mutants left and as these waves of anti mutant hysteria build like youll see start to happen in issue 504 people start knocking on their door saying i need help
3839423 we wanted to use someone like the current mayor of san francisco gavin newsom whos young and well aware of the polycultural city hes on top of
3839424 our mayor is definitely optimistic and based on what little weve seen of her it may be easy to assume that shes naieve but when she goes into crisis mode she really shines she becomes quite confidant and capable and absolutely the right person for the job
3839425 the stuff with angel and archangel is happening at the same time
3839426 were going to start to see the ways in which having dual memberships in these teams affects people the weight of these secrets will get very heavy very fast
3839427 its not a thing that comes lightly to scott hes an intractably good man hes the steward and the shepherd the mutant moses trying to lead his people out of certain doom and hes going to lead them out however he has to
3839428 hes not a killer or a soldier but this is who hes been trained to be his entire life the sort of slow and sad realization hes going to come to is that in a lot ways professor xavier was right in terms of whom scott needs to be his whole life has been training for what he is now
3839429 because of how heavy things had been in storylines like messiah complex and divided we stand we wanted to write a fun self contained special effects laden adventure story and part of that meant writing magneto like how he was in the early days of uncanny x men
3839430 but that was also a gag and stunt which he used to flummox and distract the x men while the high evolutionary and kingo sunen a member of the eternals who currently believes hes a japanese filmmaker were lobotomizing the dreaming celestial later we see magneto with the high evolutionary hes much more the character we know a lion in winter
3839431 well learn why the two came together and why theyre working together
3839432 that stuff is going to develop for the next few years weve got a real road map were driving on and its pretty exciting it gives us the opportunity to do detailed foreshadowing like this
3839433 san francisco is an awful big city and the x men werent the first mutants there
3839434 in the months ahead were going to watch their membership grow and youll get hints about their agenda
3839435 the core is scott emma wolverine storm angel beast and nightcrawler your main guys are here but then as we extend out from there people can come and go
3839436 we didnt want to get ourselves trapped and not able to tell a nightcrawler story because hes in another book so part of the idea of having everyone live in the big city is that everyone lives in the big city and readers arent going jesus how big is that mansion everybody is here and theyre going to rotate in and rotate out as we need them so its fun because where else do we get to write every character we want to write and not have our hands tied
3839437 even though they moved out of new york were going to start to see the x men tying into the marvel universe in ways they havent for quite awhile
3839438 yo no estar a en el d a a d a pero s un equipo de profesionales

3839458 the drive for high productivity and cost effectiveness of the group over the past decade have enabled the group to achieve better results despite the higher costs
3839459 the concern is that the telecommunication revolution may widen existing social gaps creating two distinct classes of information haves and information have nots this concern is far from trivial

3839464 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3839465 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3839466 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3839467 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3839468 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3839469 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3839470 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3839471 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3839472 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3839473 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3839474 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3839475 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3839476 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3839477 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3839478 im going upstairs to my bedroom and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me

3839493 i hope these songs we sing will be much more than music i know its so difficult at times when were thinking about chords and lyrics and when to hit the right effect patch but would you just help that to become second nature so that we can truly worship you from our hearts
3839494 you dont decide who youre going to reach and then pick a music style you pick a music style and that determines whos going to come
3839495 i knew that the future even in the early 80s was with bands in churches
3839496 i liked hymns as a kid but i just didnt see myself waving my arms and directing them ive always been one of those guys who tries to figure

3839501 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3839502 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3839503 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3839504 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3839505 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3839506 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3839507 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3839508 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3839509 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3839510 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3839511 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3839512 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3839513 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3839514 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3839515 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3839516 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3839517 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3839518 isto eh cabriolet de luxo mas soh pra quem sabe conduzir
3839519 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3839520 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3839521 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3839522 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3839523 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3839524 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3839525 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3839526 if we dont get the money by the end of the week we will start erecting barricades use stones stakes and manure to protest
3839527 a more serious offensive is still to come and they the government will eventually bear the responsibility for their negligence and inefficiency
3839528 at the moment i have no one to speak to in brussels they are all on holiday
3839529 all these areas we controlled since 2003 but now they are coming and attacking and now they are in the control of the government
3839530 they are readying to move to other places the government is cheating us and cheating the international community they are going to destroy all the places to control them
3839531 government soldiers are shooting randomly in the area civilians have been killed and are missing some have fled
3839532 government forces and arab militia are moving north the government is conducting the second round of ethnic cleansing in northern darfur i call on the international community to stop the killing of civilians
3839533 the movement is still in pursuit of enemy forces at various locations

3839535 has no record of mr ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
3839536 the interior ministry does not have the right to threaten the media for questioning the authenticity of the claim
3839537 truth of such an important issue must be made clear
3839538 under cover of the disengagement from gaza sharon will complete the separation fence and expand settlement construction in the west bank west of the fence he will say that israel is only taking 8 percent of the west bank and that we should establish our state in temporary borders on the remaining land without east jerusalem and without a solution to the refugee problem
3839539 it appears that a suicide bomber blew himself up next to the police in a very crowded area we have five people killed and seven injured at the moment
3839540 it appears the motorcycle rider blasted them his body was making burning noises
3839541 i saw at least three policemen lying on the ground unconscious or dead there were three to four other policemen standing nearby with their uniforms torn

3839554 i know of the extraordinary planning and subsequent mobilization that had to take place that day it required exceptional effort of your staff
3839555 the unwritten law has been unfortunately that clearly priests and bishops are treated differently even if theyve raped children than other citizens and that has to change

3839575 jewelry is composed of various metals and gemstones so there isnt one specific method for cleaning
3839576 many of those gemstones can be porous or non porous so you have to be careful and take care when cleaning them
3839577 for heavily tarnished weve made a paste of three parts baking soda one part water
3839578 apply the cleaner with a soft cloth and work it into the tarnished silver once the silver is removed rinse and buff dry
3839579 with everyday wear your gold rings and necklaces can be lodged with dirt and body oils
3839580 give them a quick bubble bath with seltzer water or club soda and mild dishwasher detergent the bubbles will help loosen dirt lodged between crevices place your jewelry in a strainer and allow it to soak for five minutes in the solution with a soft tooth brush rub the pieces to dislodge any dirt
3839581 studies show that for long endurance athletes drinking some carbohydrates or some sugar actually helps enhance performance because it refuels the muscles
3839582 there is another reason that people exercising for longer than an hour might benefit from a sports drink and that is if you are sweating hard for a long period of time you are loosing a lot of salt in your sweat and that can start to be a problem and the other thing that sports drinks contain is sodium and electrolytes
3839583 they obviously cant do anything to replenish your muscles because theyve taken the sugar out but they are lower in calories
3839584 so if you are using a sport drink just as way to get more fluids and the flavor helps you drink more then the lower calorie options maybe helpful but again water is really the ideal beverage for most people who are working out
3839585 having some vitamins dissolved in the water is not going to make a difference in your workout
3839586 it can be a way to get some vitamins but really if you are taking a multivitamin every day you are not getting any extra benefit
3839587 the most recent studies show that having protein in a sports drink doesnt actually enhance your performance at all
3839588 the time you need protein is after your workout if you worked out very strenuously protein can help you rebuild the muscles and help you recover

3839592 one can hardly imagine medvedev venturing an outright u turn in policy
3839593 but he has clearly taken the wheel and is trying to steer it stronger than one might think he would
3839594 medvedev has created his anti corruption council which could turn into a powerful tool and set the ball running in reforming the judicial system

3839601 much has been made about the poor air quality in china and the effect it is having on our athletes
3839602 but we have a serious home grown pollution problem right here and canadians ranging from the very young to the very old are paying the price
3839603 both of which rise during pollution episodes and in the few days afterwards and explain in significant part the number of acute deaths due to air pollution
3839604 canada gets a fair bit of pollution from the american midwest which drifts north comes across through ontario and continues right on through to quebec
3839605 sometimes people in rural areas think theyre escaping very nicely because they dont live in downtown wherever the fact is these masses of air pollution move across the countryside and some of our worst air pollution occurs in rural areas because it just happens to be downwind
3839606 this report shows for the first time the tragic effects of the toxic air that we breathe whether it is in my hometown of vancouver or across the country in st johns

3839617 el betis que tenemos hoy no es el necesario para competir al m ximo nivel y quedar entre los 7 primeros de la liga espa ola con lo que hemos esperado para hablar a que la afici n opinara sobre qu betis tienen ahora y si les gusta o no para la pr xima temporada est bamos ya trabajando para hacer un buen proyecto de este betis el aval que presenta luis castel no s lo iba para las acciones sino tambi n para avalar los fichajes primero el de emana que era el que ten a lopera en ese momento encima de la mesa esa opci n significaba un futuro muy distinto al que se podr a plantear por el accionista mayoritario
3839618 nosotros no contamos el proceso porque se nos ocurre si no porque sucede castel y lopera se reunen ellos dos solos y llegan al acuerdo econ mico de la opci n de compra del paquete accionarial algo que se cierra con un abrazo y un apret n de manos por eso es por lo que castel lo da por hecho todo nos enteramos a ltima hora de madrugada del d a anterior de la aparici n de esta segunda oferta que es la que parece realmente que se va a hacer con el paquete de lopera ten amos una cita el mi rcoles y en la llamada de la noche anterior nos dan la opci n a una recompra que se nos escuchar a a nosotros despu s de esa opci n b pero el betis no es una chochona que se vende y se subasta al mejor postor
3839619 quer amos a lopera dentro del nuevo organigrama pero no que ostentara un cargo de m xima importancia porque no lo cre amos oportuno manuel ruiz de lopera es una persona a la que yo le tengo un gran respeto personal cuando lleg fue una total solucion pero ahora en la actualidad se est convirtiendo en todo un problema y lo digo con dolor porque es un gran b tico que ha proyectado una ilusi n de un betis grande yo esperaba en nuestro proyecto conjunto con lopera articular una opci n de reparto del paquete mayoritario del 51 pero eso parece ser imposible ahora mismo

3839636 president roosevelt signed the social security act into law on august 14 1935
3839637 c onventional thinking in washington says that social security is the third rail of american politics it says you should hedge and dodge and spin but at all costs dont answer
3839638 clinton sidesteps social security talk obama says in d m
3839639 obama started his campaign saying his plans would not increase taxes for people earning less than 250 000 but he found himself in an apparent contradiction by saying he would tax all income to fund social security not just income up to 102 000 as is now the case
3839640 so now obamas plan calls for no social security tax on income between 102 000 and 250 000 but all income above 250 000 would be taxed for social security
3839641 prior to june 13 2008 obama had kept open the possibility that he would impose the 12 4 percent social security tax on income as low as 97 500 the annually adjusted ceiling in place in 2007
3839642 while obama has suggested imposing the 12 4 percent tax on all income above 97 000 per year edwards would only impose it on those making more than 200 000 per year
3839643 if we kept the payroll tax rate exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
3839644 under current law income up to 102 000 a year is taxed for social security obama would create a doughnut hole by not imposing new social security taxes on income between 102 000 and 250 000 his aides said income exceeding 250 000 would be taxed at a rate of 2 percent to 4 percent rather than the 6 percent tax that people pay toward social security on income below the 102 000 cutoff which is matched by their employers paying a 6 percent tax employers would probably pay an additional tax but the total tax paid by both employee and employer would not exceed 4 percent of the amount of income earned over 250 000
3839645 projections provided by obamas campaign staff say that uncapping the payroll tax would solve projected shortfalls for at least 75 years
3839646 clinton sidesteps social security talk obama says in d m
3839647 options to adjust social security earnings cap static impact on individual income and payroll tax liability and revenue billions 2009 18
3839648 if all earnings were subject to the payroll tax but the base was retained for benefit calculations the social security trust funds would remain solvent for the next 75 years however the link between contributions and benefits would be broken
3839649 experts predict that obamas proposal would make up less than half of the 4 3 trillion shortfall social security is expected to face over the next 75 years
3839650 and for seniors in particular what i want to do is eliminate the income tax on social security that is something that we werent taxing up until 1993 and if we could eliminate that income tax that would save the average social security recipient up to 1 400 a year which would help to pay for a lot of these rising costs
3839651 the 1993 measure increased to 85 percent from 50 percent the portion of social security benefits subject to income tax when a retirees income including half of his or her annual social security benefit exceeds certain levels those levels are 34 000 for a single person and 44 000 for a married couple
3839652 g o p seeks to repeal tax on social security benefits

3839688 its a location thats on the citys radar the official reports dont mean there havent been crashes there
3839689 as a rider you always want to pay attention through there if you are not careful about how you do the crossing it can be difficult
3839690 the railroads attitude is that if cars can safely drive over that thats the limit of their responsibility the city of golden does not have any strict responsibility in terms of the crossing what we do is provide the advance warning to motorists and cyclists there is a sign on both sides of the road
3839691 cyclists need to ride into the tracks at a 90 degree angle which means they may have to look back and get to the center of the street in order to do that
3839692 ive heard from numerous people about that intersection its the way the tracks cross the road at a funny angle i doubt they can completely resolve it i think accidents happen when people approach it when they should just get off the bike and walk its a lot safer
3839693 i ride my bike to and from work sometimes i think its all about the rider learning how to bike properly i have been biking 18 years and never once crashed people need to be educated about the laws its all about how you ride across that section
3839694 that crossing is pretty nasty ive ridden with people who get really nervous when theyre near railroad tracks you have to pay attention to traffic

3839739 therefore i said to you that you will die in your sins for if you do not believe that i am he you will die in your sins
3839740 why does this man speak blasphemies like this who can forgive sins but god alone
3839741 why do you reason about these things in your hearts
3839742 which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven you or to say arise take up your bed and walk
3839743 but that you may know that the son of man has power on earth to forgive sins
3839744 i say to you arise take up your bed and go to your house

3839771 o woman great is your faith let it be to you as you desire

3839775 lord do not trouble yourself for i am not worthy that you should enter under my roof
3839776 therefore i did not even think myself worthy to come to you but say the word and my servant will be healed
3839777 i say to you i have not found such great faith not even in israel
3839778 god sends no one away empty except those who are full of themselves
3839779 god resists the proud but gives grace to the humble
3839780 for he loves our nation and has built us a synagogue
3839781 western countries should not support them israel so much the life of this regime has come to an end
3839782 our position is clear on this issue a referendum should take place in palestine if they withdraw from invaded lands it would be a good step

3839784 has no record of mr ali kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university
3839785 the interior ministry does not have the right to threaten the media for questioning the authenticity of the claim
3839786 truth of such an important issue must be made clear
3839787 would you like being introduced as one of my favorite black comedians
3839788 increasing temperature and increasing carbon dioxide the result of global warming increase the ragweed pollen production up to two to four times than its normal production the previous years
3839789 ragweed allergy will be more severe and last longer this year
3839790 im seeing patients that never have allergy before even in their 60s 70s or 80s or young children became sensitized directly to ragweed pollen
3839791 if you are a patient and have allergy problems and suffering if you check the pollen count and its very high then you need to plan ahead
3839792 you should not be outside more than eight hours without taking your allergy medication
3839793 im both excited and anxious to see what will happen they always surprise me
3839794 it gets better every season so i can only hope that season three will top the rest and so on
3839795 it was depressing but everything happens for a reason i just tried to get back on the field as soon as i could
3839796 im trying to get as good as i possibly can
3839797 with practicing watching film everything physically getting better i want to be in the best shape ever
3839798 ross is doing a great job filling in that position
3839799 hes very instinctive and has a knack for making big plays hes going to be a great player
3839800 i cant take that for granted because we have a great linebacking corps
3839801 the competition is always great so ill have to go out there everyday and just compete
3839802 austin is doing a great job also and is a guy that can play all three linebacking positions
3839803 so were excited to see and its going to be a great challenge to see who comes out of there as the starting linebacker
3839804 now ive put a little chip on my shoulder and ive just got to move on take my situation and turn it into a positive and use it as motivation
3839805 i cant play the first two games thats the reality of it those are facts
3839806 donald is a great kid and i have the utmost confidence he is going to be a great player for us this year
3839807 now all of us need to go day by day but i have a lot of confidence hell be ready to roll
3839808 weve seen more folks interested in riding than ever before
3839809 whether theyre going to work or just getting around town were already booking classes for september now
3839810 younger people make up a big portion of the classes
3839811 it really makes you a better rider and a better driver all the way around
3839812 i think it should be required if youre going to ride
3839813 a lot of riders will see their insurance go down
3839814 its a great discount and really shows how much value the class has when it comes to safety
3839815 we have people who have never touched a bike and people who have been riding for more than 30 years
3839816 its a lot safer way to learn than just picking up a bike out on a dirt road with your brother
3839817 when you get down to it its just a lot of fun
3839818 this has been an extremely hard decision for me to make ive given everything i can to be ready to compete at this olympic games
3839819 its best for me to step down and have another athlete fill my position this is something for me thats very tough because its the end of my career and its not the way i had planned it
3839820 the value of a relationship is in direct proportion to the time that you invest in the relationship
3839821 i had never considered dating until he convinced me otherwise
3839822 i learned a lot about my faith because he was questioning some of the things
3839823 even though i dont practice my mom was a big barrier
3839824 her even conceiving the idea of me marrying somebody that was not going to be of our community was difficult
3839825 we had to talk about issues related to marriage and how it would work out
3839826 the village leader told my mom i was excommunicated from the community
3839827 i would rather have my child raised in a faith i mean no faith is probably not the best way
3839828 because he knows more about his faith and practices it when it comes to our kids id rather have them raised in a religion that at least one of their parents understands follows and believes in than them being raised in islam because i myself dont understand a lot of things
3839829 but reading a book is much different than seeing how a religion is practiced
3839830 at this point im considering learning more i think in the next few years when we have a kid ill have a good idea where i stand in my faith
3839831 its constant thinking about how are we going to tell mom
3839832 we dont want her to get disappointed or sad and it adds to our stress because were trying to figure out our lives and we need to make our own choices
3839833 ive never felt pressure from him if i agree with my family on something and dont agree with him hes totally cool with it
3839834 i think thats one of the problems with other relationships hes very compromising and flexible
3839835 if he wants to be with me hell always have to consider my family hell always have to negotiate his relationships with my mom my grandma my brother
3839836 shes been such a good dog i knew that if she was there she was doing her best to take care of jake
3839837 it was a relief to know that theres an end and that we still have a part of jake
3839838 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3839839 we need to put some weight on her shes a big dog and looks too skinny

3839843 die schwerpunktkontrollen tragen bei uns sicher zur beruhigung bei aber auch sensibilisierung durch die medien hat einen anteil an dieser positiv entwicklung
