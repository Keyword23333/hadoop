3470000 moore wasnt very good hes one of quarterback tim tebows favorite targets right now they worked all summer and you can tell they worked all summer
3470001 very athletic moves really well can he understand it and learn it our secondary coach chuck heater is pretty excited about it
3470002 this is only my fifth day back in eight months i feel like its going to get back its just going to take a little bit more time
3470003 but yall havent gotten a big chance to see that because of injuries and whatnot but well see this year
3470004 coach mac duff kind of gave me a hard time because we never worked with sergio on pass drops
3470005 my comment to him was a thoroughbred doesnt go backwards
3470006 when he had his incident last summer he was honest with me and told me exactly what happened and said he was really sorry and handled it on the practice field he works really hard he will get mad at himself if he doesnt do well
3470007 i was in shock because thats not serg it brought him down to earth a little bit at a school like texas sometimes you think you have an s on your chest when youre just a normal kid spiritually it brought him back to where he needs to be
3470008 the coaches had a hard time moving him in and out
3470009 from my standpoint the best kid was on the sidelines but from their standpoint it was a national championship linebacker playing ahead of him
3470010 it did hamper his playing time and development he realizes that and hes playing catch up what really frustrated him was the injury in the holiday bowl though he was really ready to rock and then he misses the spring its humbled him a little bit sergio made a 3 0 in the spring and im as proud of that as any tackle he ever made
3470011 we want our best players in the best position to make plays
3470012 i like to hit and be physical and thats exactly what he likes he has brought a different element to the defense we had fire last year but now its out of the roof we blitz a lot and bring a lot of different pressures were trying to get to the quarterback the quarterback is going to be my prey im a predator
3470013 thats tough on a guy serg is one of those kids who when he bonds with a coach that relationship means a lot when you have that bond with him hell run through a wall for you
3470014 i think this is going to be a great season for him i saw that sparkle in his eye a couple times this summer when we spoke in person it was the sparkle i saw in high school
3470015 people need to know how hard that kid has worked
3470016 he has hung in there and persevered and i think its going to pay off for him this year and later in life now that they are fitting the scheme to a player like sergs talents instead of trying to fit him in a scheme that doesnt feature his talents the strings will be cut off of him and everyone will see the old sergio this season
3470017 we need him to play good and be on the field
3470018 hes got great ability and hes passionate were hoping he has a chance to play and stay healthy
3470019 everybody who is talking about the hype around me i dont worry about that now
3470020 im just playing football and ill give it my best every time out

3470027 folks appear to have always had good feelings about hospitals mostly because they actually do stuff that makes sick people better and you usually dont have to pay for it
3470028 i suspect thats not going to last as hospitals get more aggressive about billing
3470029 therefore we would also expect a rise in the number of elderly patients with stroke in the future

3470031 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3470032 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3470033 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect

3470036 i believe that investment in alternative energies like wind solar and geothermal forms of energy that will create jobs right here in southwest michigan
3470037 what i dont support is a bill that gives huge incentives to continue our dependence on oil this election presents a clear choice continue down a path of an energy policy that advocates no new energy sources and wars in the middle east to procure oil or a forward thinking energy plan that promises clean safe and sustainable energy for generations to come
3470038 the signal we need to send is not to wall street but to main street
3470039 small business owners entrepreneurs and consumers alike in southwest michigan should know that the coming green revolution will create thousands of jobs in the region curb global warming make us more safe and protect the environment
3470040 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3470041 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3470042 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3470043 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3470044 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3470045 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3470046 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture australian rock is all about good on ya mate well done for getting up on stage and switching that amplifier on
3470047 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3470048 its a really poor piece of journalism from a music writer who once had relevance and influence but now hes living in australia he doesnt really have the knowledge or experience of the local industry to back up his opinions
3470049 its just a shame he gets to hide under the masthead of the guardian which gives him credence where none is due
3470050 i think there are parts of the british press that seem to enjoy denigrating their subjects
3470051 but i certainly dont think it is something that happens all the time
3470052 judging by the response obviously there is which is nice
3470053 hell be given one then hopefully through his attorney well be able to talk to him

3470056 we started the torrentprivacy project at the end of 2007 the idea was to give torrent users an anonymous bittorrent service from a party they can trust torrentreactor has been online for approximately 4 years and we believe that when people see that torrentprivacy uses ns1 ns2 torrentreactor net as dns servers they wont have any questions about a possible government setup of torrentprivacy com
3470057 we dont like the situation where two organizations from the usa believe they can rule the world the pirate bay showed them that other countries have other laws and american laws dont work outside of usa we want to be the pain in their asses and allow users to download what they want without fear of a sudden door knock
3470058 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3470059 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3470060 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3470061 they thought that the georgians who are orthodox too would not dare touch them inside the holy walls but it turned out the troops burnt them alive there
3470062 they also took a big group of young women and moved in an unknown direction there is no further information about their fate
3470063 dit is wel lekker zo een rustdag we hebben geluncht met de prins en prinses dat was echt leuk daarna nog een filmpje gekeken maar wat we nu doen is toch wel het belangrijkst
3470064 we kozen de verkeerde kant van het eerste kruisrak de wind draaide de andere kant op daarna werd deze race een inhaalrace voor ons
3470065 die negende plaats is dan nog best redelijk ik hoop dat we hem aan het einde niet mee hoeven te tellen maar deze is goed genoeg het resultaat van gisteren is niet zo eenvoudig te herhalen vandaag was de wind stabieler maar veel minder makkelijk te zien en te lezen op het water
3470066 ik was aardig kapot heb alles gegeven maar het is nog niet genoeg ik wist dit van te voren dat het niet mijn omstandigheden zijn hier in china maar ik had graag beter willen doen in deze condities kan dat ook wel ik was nu twee keer te laat weg bij de start en vaar dan achter de feiten aan ik moet dan extra veel geven om erbij te blijven en dat breekt me aan het einde van zo een race weer op dan kan ik amper mijn giek niet meer vasthouden sommigen zijn 10 kilo lichter en die gaan en stuk harder ik vind het bijna geen windsurfen maar ik wilde hier zijn en leren in voorbereiding op london en ik wil ook met minder wind nog beter worden
3470067 ik heb vandaag twee keer niet goed gevaren de eerste race was ik niet scherp en ik weet dat ik beter kan dan dat de tweede race was ik scherper maar maakte een domme keuze ik ging voor meer wind terwijl het veld aan de andere kant meer voordeel had van de stroming
3470068 ja dat is op zich wel leuk maar het is ook jammer van deze resultaten ik moet gewoon blijven varen zoals ik altijd vaar het is een sterk veld maar dat is juist mooi het moet beter
3470069 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3470070 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3470071 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3470072 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3470073 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3470074 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3470075 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3470076 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3470077 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3470078 who are open to doing something on the production side
3470079 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3470080 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3470081 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

3470093 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3470094 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3470095 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3470096 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3470097 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3470098 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3470106 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3470107 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3470108 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3470109 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3470110 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

3470138 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3470141 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3470142 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3470143 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3470144 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3470145 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve

3470155 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3470156 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3470157 this year is a very important year for the university of cincinnati we must win and we must win now we dont have time to talk about where we want to be in three to five years we have to live in the present our preparation at higher ground has been about winning now and the importance of winning right now

3470164 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3470165 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3470166 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3470167 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3470168 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3470169 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3470170 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3470171 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3470172 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3470173 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3470174 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3470175 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3470176 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3470177 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3470178 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3470179 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3470180 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3470181 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3470182 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3470183 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3470184 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3470185 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3470186 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3470187 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3470188 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3470189 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3470190 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3470191 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3470192 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3470193 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3470194 hey isnt this supposed to be the simple science of getting what you want my head is spinning and none of that was simple
3470195 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3470196 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3470197 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3470198 i have fulfilled a dream it will be unique he said on

3470206 jenna is really very good in this movie and i think that acting comedy and sex come together quite naturally for her her fans are going to be very surprised
3470207 i loved playing tabitha this movie was so much fun to make and i think people will really love it plus its the first time i had a really big role like this in a feature
3470208 teagan is extremely good and her fans get to see an entirely different side of her as tabitha becomes one sexy 18 year old cutie
3470209 i will say her sex scene with the little doll that she magically turns into a full sized man is the sexiest hardcore scene i have ever shot
3470210 that was so much fun to make because ron jeremy and sunny and i had to pop in and out of the orgy like magic
3470211 i think you can laugh and jerk off at the same time
3470212 this is by far the best movie weve ever made
3470213 lets see if she can last more then 2 full minutes with one of our roster wrestlers it is against the leagues policies to accept porn stars onto the nwwl roster however in an effort to ensure that our league showcases the very best and most talented women of professional wrestling we decided to give her a chance to prove she has what it takes
3470214 i have worked hard the last month training and feel that i can qualify porn stars can kick butt too i have fought my whole career against prejudice streotypes and conservative social values at least this time it will be a fair fight i hope
3470215 trina does most of her work on her back so thats exactly where im going to put her for the 3 count
3470216 with gas prices soaring and many of our employees traveling long distances to get to work we thought that it would be a great idea to offer our employees an alternative workweek schedule
3470217 not only will it cut down the costs of travel for employees who in essence will have an additional month off per year when you add up all the fridays that they dont have to work but it will also reduce operating costs at the 8484 wilshire boulevard building

3470229 of all the housemates he wants to be here the least and when someone does feel that way it makes it harder to get on with them in the house
3470230 shes not really bothered about being on big brother if she was she would have auditioned for her its just a chance to be with her boyfriend but you cant just come in at the end and reap all the benefits and rewards from it
3470231 he dont really enjoy his time in here now and hes said if he stays here hes not going to do anything around the house
3470232 i dont trust her id say shes devious she doesnt actually say some things she makes you feels uncomfortable with the way she is acting its all a game she creates rows i think
3470233 hes very arrogant and controlling within the house and the way he speaks to people i still do wonder what rex is doing here i do feel that he still looks down on people
3470234 rex has been really really bad to live with from day one hes bossed people about hes been nasty hes tried to brew up arguments hes been banging on for the last eight weeks about how bored he is and how much he wants his girlfriend and all theyve really done since arriving in the house is bicker
3470235 although shes good fun its just all a bit of glamour in this house for her and i think generally she doesnt even enjoy it nicole is very very selfish
3470236 i just dont really agree with the way he handles things especially today being nasty and stirring up little comments i dont think he deserves to be here the way he keeps going on about how he wants to go home
3470237 i just feel like she licks kats a e the whole time they sing together they just do everything together and i do believe its because rachel believes that kats going to win and its an easy way to get into the final
3470238 i just dont feel comfortable i just dont want to live with lisa anymore
3470239 i wasnt upset that she gave it to hell it was that she lied to all the housemates that it was better it was clear which was the better cake

3470244 little stevie van zandt has already rented out the hard rock caf for a party
3470245 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3470246 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3470247 he knows about it so its a bit strange he would complain
3470248 hes possibly exaggerating about the four tests but certainly he is part of the program he knows he will be tested more often
3470249 the point is its a good thing if hes been tested a lot
3470250 hes a favorite for the 100 meters so why not
3470251 blood tested once and urine tested once since ive been here
3470252 its what im doing to show my love for my sport
3470253 it comes with the territory past champions have tested positive but an olympic champion needs to carry himself clean to be clean and to be able to prove hes clean
3470254 they are saying that they are doing like over 4 000 tests but its just very difficult
3470255 but hopefully they can make these olympic games very clean

3470274 spends 3 5 billion on arts funding and is spending more on arts than did the previous liberal government in the case of promart we think the funding choices made were inappropriate inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases with highly ideological individuals exposing their agendas or money going to wealthy celebrities or fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
3470275 if they are spending more its in adjusted for inflation dollars this is about some right wing troglodytes in the party overcome with self righteous indignation that people like toronto broadcast journalist avi lewis received funding

3470296 the advent of laser application in urology has revolutionized treatment of prostate and stone disease in recent times most of the patients have large prostates with significant co morbid illnesses and several of them are on anti coagulants which pose significant risk to the conventional procedure of turp however because of the holep advantages all of them can have complete enucleation in single sitting regardless of prostate size and an uneventful amp quick recovery also so far none of our patients have required blood transfusions as the bleeding during holep is negligible unlike turp holep is also a viable option for patients with cardiac pacemakers as holep does not use electrocautery which interferes with pacemakers even during the follow ups patients have not had any problems with sequlae like strictures or bladder neck scarring which are seen more often following turp

3470299 it is a matter of great pride amp honour for us to be at the forefront of revolutionary research work in the international arena and to be the flag bearers for our country at highly prestigious platforms like the woc we are highly pleased with the pilot study results of the use of ologen implant in phaco trab for simultaneously surgically treating both cataract amp glaucoma uptil now when an ophthalmologist decides to undertake treating both cataract amp glaucoma of the eye in a single surgery the conventional method available is phaco trab with mitomycin c the use of mitomycin c in phaco trab many times leads to significant post operative complications in the eye
3470300 it is a great achievement for us that we at gei are playing our humble part in the development of a safer and better alternative technique the ologen implant in phaco trab after the resounding success of the pilot study and the exceedingly encouraging response at the woc we are highly hopeful that as more and more comprehensive research is done on this technique and as it becomes the primary treatment for simultaneous cataract glaucoma millions of patients not only in india but all over the world will benefit from our hard work

3470353 it would seem that men and women need a common motivation namely a common adversary to organize and act together in the vacuum such as motivation seemed to have ceased to exist or have yet to be found the need for enemies seems to be a common historical factor bring the divided nation together to face an outside enemy either a real one or else one invented for the purpose democracy will be made to seem responsible for the lagging economy the scarcity and uncertainties the very concept of democracy could then be brought into question and allow for the seizure of power in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill the real enemy of the elites and their minions then is humanity itself

3470520 in building a better ghana investing in the youth and job creation shall be key pivots around which policy decisions will revolve
3470521 i am assuring the youth that atta mills as president will make sure ghana ceases to be a subsidiary of the illicit and nation destroying drug trade

3470656 reported superior pain relief in the nepafenac treated eye compared to the placebo eye during the first 3 days following surgery
3470657 although infectious keratitis occurs rarely after refractive surgery patients should be informed
3470658 patient satisfaction which is extraordinarily high for lasik but satisfaction is just one component of quality of life
3470659 could affect the interpretation of the results in some patients a new postoperative baseline macular image should be acquired
3470660 we use binocular disparity occlusion perspective and our own motion all together to create a representation of the real 3d world in our minds
3470661 several parameters were statistically correlated with keratoconus suspect defined by higher asymmetry and steeper curvature on placido topography

3470664 microincision cataract surgery did not degrade the optical quality of the cornea
3470665 we established local price points toward the end of the second quarter we began to realize a slightly lower average price per procedure which we believe will positively impact procedure volume
3470666 dissection elevation and repositioning of the laser in situ keratomileusis flap were required to resolve the interface fluid
3470667 interlamellar and interfibrillar biomechanical slippage occurs when the cornea becomes ectatic after lasik or prk in the postoperative stress bearing regions of the corneal stroma
3470668 histopathologic and ultrastructural studies suggest that interlamellar and interfibrillar biomechanical slippage occurs when the cornea becomes ectatic after lasik or prk in the postoperative stress bearing regions of the corneal stroma
3470669 this 2 phase chronic biomechanical failure process is similar to that seen in keratoconus
3470670 composite sciences classify this chronic biomechanical failure process as interfiber fracture
3470671 thirteen specimens from 12 patients undergoing corneal transplantation for progressive ectasia after lasik 12 specimens or prk 1 specimen were obtained for histopathologic and ultrastructural evaluation
3470672 all 13 ectatic corneas were submitted in formalin for light microscopy
3470673 nine specimens were bisected and the second half was placed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde for transmission electron microscopy tem
3470674 light microscopy of the post lasik specimens showed corneal epithelial hypoplasia and occasional foci of epithelial hyperplasia bowmans layer breaks a normal stromal thickness of the lasik flap a normal thickness of the hypocellular primitive stromal scar a thinned residual stromal bed rsb and larger than normal artifacteous interlamellar clefts in the rsb of the ectatic region
3470675 the post prk specimen showed similar findings with the addition of a thinned hypercellular fibrotic stromal scar
3470676 tem showed thinning of the collagen lamellae and loss of lamellar number in the rsb of post lasik ectasia corneas or throughout the entire corneal stromal bed in the post prk ectasia cornea with the posterior aspect of the corneal stroma being most affected
3470677 i do regret if my comments can be taken as being sexist or being offensive to the larger group thats why i put out a retraction and apology today

3470679 when i used the term making tea i was not talking about any gender specific activity but it was a figurative thing meaning doing brian mulroneys bidding we know she was appointed to the senate by brian mulroney and is widely regarded as being his proxy in cabinet and those are the matters that i was referring to
3470680 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3470681 if liberal mps are allowed to publicly use offensive language like thibaults without consequence it shows that stephane dions commitment to women in politics rings hollow
3470682 many of them are worried about the kind of tone thats set where women are stereotyped

3470686 there are a lot of patients out there who are taking statins who could save a lot of money by splitting a larger tablet or perhaps even moving to a lower cost statin and splitting a larger tablet of that statin and save even more money
3470687 typically the difference between a split tablet where theres a little bit more on one half of the tablet than on the next fragment it cant possibly make any meaningful difference in terms of the drugs effect
3470688 but it definitely can to the users pocketbook its very much like buying any other commodity in bulk whether you buy cereal or flower or rice or sugar most people will buy it in a larger size
3470689 if one is going to take a drug for a few weeks say an antibiotic if you pay 35 compared with 10 its not usually a big deal
3470690 but if youre going to take it for years or potentially the rest of your life its a huge deal where the cash out of your pocket is after tax income
3470691 yes its absolutely wonderful if youre looking at drugs where you dont need the exact exact exact dose where you can be off by a little bit and its fine
3470692 absolutely industry knows about this and theyre definitely thinking ok what do we do about it

3470702 ai cerut apoi date concrete ma rog mai intai criterii dar ne am lamurit
3470703 apoi constat ca ne apropiem de cateva criterii mai rezonabile de exemplu numarul de dosare solutionate numarul de condamnari raportat la numarul de returnari de dosare sau de sentinte de achitare samd deci putem avea si astfel de criterii
3470704 cand am ajuns la date concrete numar de cazuri de mare coruptie trimise in instanta cu sanse sa ramana acolo si sa nu se intoarca inapoi din motive procedurale tu ii dadeai inainte cu dosarele blocate in parlament desi scrisesem din primul sau al doilea comentariu al meu ca blocarea cu pricina este o alta discutie

3470753 t here is little evidence that a significant number of guilty people are going free because of the miranda warning the chief reason for this is that contrary to expectations most people under arrest do not keep their mouths shut and do not ask for a lawyer even though it is almost always in their interest to do so
3470754 our citizens confidence in the criminal justice system will be strengthened by ensuring that the rules will be fair to crime victims as well as suspects will protect the public by helping convict those who voluntarily confess their guilt and will promote honesty and accuracy in criminal trials by allowing the jury to hear all truthful evidence a society that beats confessions out of suspects has lost its morals but a society that rejects a suspects voluntarily given confession has lost its marbles
3470755 when people around the world go to the movies they see a bad guy who has just murdered a nun impaled a policeman and blown up a school collared by eastwood or stallone or tommy lee jones what are the first words out of the good guys mouth you have the right to remain silent the viewer has to wonder what kind of political paradise america really is people seeing this in belgrade and harare and kuala lumpur places where the innocent get whacked and beaten and tortured at the whim of the authorities can only be awestruck at a country that treats even its monsters with such delicacy
3470756 who invokes their right to remain silent or especially their right to counsel the usual suspects the hardened criminals the ones who have been through the system many times before or who come into it well heeled and well counseled these offenders dont need the warnings to understand their rights and they are quick to assert them for all the rest miranda amounts to little more than red tape just another part of the ritual of putting on the handcuffs and making the trip to the station miranda does little if anything to protect the most vulnerable suspects

3470828 oh im sorry lady i couldnt find that item in a size 16 try online i hear shopping on the internet is much easier than coming into the store and screwing up all the items that ive already recovered like 1500 times

3470830 thats why im not in the piece of shit business
3470831 this is unfortunately one of the most insane obscene and disgusting things ive heard in all my public life
3470832 mmm sounds interesting lets start a study and maybe do a pilot
3470833 i made a major change to my topic because you guys have already heard everything i had to say
3470834 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
3470835 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
3470836 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
3470837 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
3470838 the idea with open source software is to allow early adopters access to the buggier pieces of code so they can help fix them or let people who want to wait for a solid release the ability to do that
3470839 the key is choice and google has taken away that choice and is developing android like every other piece of closed software
3470840 rather than trying to push yet another platform google ought to be bringing the market together and building applications which is where theyre going to make their money
3470841 the developer discontent is just part of what has turned out to be a flawed strategy
3470842 its the very same reason why apple didnt do third party developers first and thats to assure the process and the program and the quality thats initially being offered
3470843 the community must not forget that google is dealing with partners in the cell phone industry and they certainly have a reputation of a closed source tight lipped mentality
3470844 the community can cry foul if google releases the newest sdk to developers a week before handsets hit the stores but as far as i have heard that is far from the truth
3470845 within the next six months symbian and android will combine into a single open source os
3470846 on the other hand it would be much easier to do now than to tackle it in the future when developers are that much farther down the road
3470847 to tie symbian and android together would require an awful lot of heavy lifting between google and nokia and to do that kind of an agreement would be problematic
3470848 it would have been easier while symbian was small and independent but now that symbian is basically a subsidiary of nokia its going to be pretty difficult
3470849 if you develop for apple youve got a ready market
3470850 if you develop for android its a crapshoot because theres no assurance that the android platform is even going to sell
3470851 while google does simple well this is googles first device as opposed to apple which clearly has been doing devices for a while
3470852 apple is treating developers terribly and really undermining the community
3470853 the fact that applications have to go through the itunes store in order to be distributed really shows how much control apple has over the entire os
3470854 at the end of the day developers want to make money
3470855 so theyre going to develop on a platform and put resources on a platform that will make them money
3470856 undoubtedly some developers have written android off and will never return
3470857 lots arent paying a darn bit of attention to the whole mess because there arent any devices ready yet

3471166 making our voices heard a civil rights agenda for new york citys sikhs
3471167 saying that every man is equal is not enough it is time that every sikh american should not be afraid to walk out of their home in their own city and in their own country
3471168 well yeah me and my friends rode our horses into the middle of the christian tent revival brandishing rifles
3471169 i must admit that we found iron butterflys extended performance enthralling because we were all really high but then the ring of burning fuel that surrounded them may have played a part
3471170 while were all still mourning the impending loss of the nightlight lounge last week the music community suffered another loss that served to bring things into perspective a bit
3471171 someone asked me yesterday what would be our strategy and i just told him if the day belongs to me none can stop me and it was such a day
3471172 you see 142 was just not enough we did not capitalise on the first six overs and then lost wickets at regular intervals it is not easy for a new batsman to come and start playing his shots we could not concentrate enough
3471173 its extremely disappointing to lose in such a manner in front of the home crowd
3471174 pakistan has erected nine mobile towers in its territory along the loc with its signal reaching our side of the land

3471177 what this study shows is that doctors should be doing regular monitoring of these children over time because a one time checkup might not be enough to tell if they are at risk for developing diabetes
3471178 to better treat at risk children we need better ways to monitor beta cell function and visceral fat buildup
3471179 those are tough to measure but are probably the main factors determining who will get type 2 diabetes
3471180 the study provides great insight into the risk factors that lead to the progression towards type 2 diabetes in this population
3471181 only by understanding how this devastating disease develops will be able to begin taking steps to prevent it
3471182 persistence of pre diabetes in overweight and obese hispanic children association with progressive insulin resistance poor beta cell function and increasing visceral fat
3471183 people make a cost benefit calculation when considering whether to have an extramarital affair this calculation has a connection with biological and socioeconomic factors and men and women calculate the net benefits from having an affair differently
3471184 so what did you do last night the economics of infidelity
3471185 the benefits of female infidelity reduce after the age of 40 because a woman would no longer benefit in terms of improved gene quality from the affair men also experience a reduction of sperm quality around the age of 45 but the reproductive benefits of an affair expend further into a mans lifetime than a womans
3471186 if a couple divorces because of an extramarital affair a woman married to a highly educated man will lose income and may not be able to find another partner of similar quality men act as if this consideration is not important
3471187 the result that religion does not affect male behavior toward infidelity is consistent with expectations based on biology as with spousal education men dont weigh the costs spousal quality or eternal damnation when deciding whether or not to have an affair
3471188 to the place where the actual bones of the apostle st james are enshrined in that silver reliquary
3471189 may they blush for shame therefore those envious people beyond the mountains who claim to have some part of it or possess relics of it
3471190 it was about three feet long a foot deep and a foot wide and it contained a quantity of very old bones the party was overwhelmed by emotion one workman fainted and remained blind for half an hour after he had recovered consciousness the clerk of the works was sent to tell the archbishop though the time was 2am and woke up the place by throwing stones at the coachmans window

3471211 i completed a course where i learned how to treat my children
3471212 they are people and not robots they are my children and not a burden
3471213 this course made me see the reason why i ended the relationship with my girlfriend
3471214 now i know why and how i can resolve a conflict that comes into my life
3471215 cada persona en su existencia puede tener dos actitudes construir o plantar los constructores un d a terminan aqu llo que estaban haciendo y entonces les invade el tedio los que plantan a veces sufren con las tempestades y las estaciones pero el jard n jam s para de crecer

3471219 by the middle of the eight century bc assyria had become the dominant world power and was rapidly expanding westward to the palestinian states after several rebellions israel was attacked by assyria in 725 samaria was besieged and eventually fell in 721 the bulk of the israelite population the ten northern tribes was deported and scattered throughout other parts of assyrias empire while populations of foreigners from other parts were brought into israels territories in this act of assyria an example of its policy of imperial subjugation lies the origins of the mixed race of samaritans so the northern kingdom of israel ceased to exist its territory now nothing more than a province under the paw of the assyrian lion a paw now poised ominously close to judah
3471220 the legal cases between oklahoma and arkansas evolved from a conflict over point source pollution involving municipal wastewater discharge to a conflict over nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrient runoff from poultry litter
3471221 in light of three decades or more of significant structural changes in the animal agricultural production system this shift from point source to nonpoint source mirrors the evolution of how water quality has been addressed since the enactment of clean water act
3471222 discernable confined and discrete conveyances including any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well from which pollutants may be discharged
3471223 a consequence of these structural changes is that extraordinary amounts of animal waste are produced in geographically limited areas
3471224 this waste must be disposed of or utilized somehow and a traditional and common method is for producers to apply it to the land as fertilizer
3471225 policymakers may begin to consider new policy approaches to addressing nonpoint source pollution particularly if they conclude that addressing the issue through region based litigation may not be the most effective tool to address a national issue the thought might be that perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation
3471226 linking this approach with some type of comprehensive watershed management system may be a new paradigm in which policymakers can address nonpoint source pollution from agriculture

3471283 literally just a few hours after reaching an agreement on holding negotiations to resolve the escalation in the south ossetian conflict georgian military divisions began a treacherous and massive attack against tskhinvali which is the capital of the south ossetian province of georgia
3471284 at 3 a m local time georgian tanks and infantry began to attack the southern parts of tskhinvali
3471285 immediately call for an end to the hostilities and for a rejection of the use of force
3471286 to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the republic of georgia
3471287 to de escalate the tension by sending envoys to the region to restart the negotiation process
3471288 the potential for further escalation of the violence is real
3471289 open lines of communication between the sides at the highest level and that confidence be established and nurtured
3471290 refused to reach an agreement on the non use of force in the georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian conflicts which would protect georgia against any attempt to use force by anyone at all

3471296 the group of 8 exists not because someone likes or dislikes it but because objectively they are the biggest world economies and the most serious players from the foreign policy point of view
3471297 it the global economy has to be improved it has to be more up to date better protected from risks and it must not suffer from national egoism financial and economic egoism but must be more fair toward other countries this is absolutely evident this system cannot be oriented toward only one country and only one currency
3471298 that a revived russia has a right to assume a larger role in a world economic system that should no longer be dominated by the united states
3471299 just let me go for now ill be just fine dont you know dont you know now that im back on my own

3471376 is the parent wanting to have influence over how the coach coaches and in this case wanting his son to have a chance to play before coach taylor kyle chandler is ready to do it ultimately the story line gets more personal because it becomes not only about him trying to influence the coach but about the pressure hes putting on his kid and coach becoming aware of that and having to intervene

3471381 what this study shows is that doctors should be doing regular monitoring of these children over time because a one time checkup might not be enough to tell if they are at risk for developing diabetes
3471382 to better treat at risk children we need better ways to monitor beta cell function and visceral fat buildup
3471383 those are tough to measure but are probably the main factors determining who will get type 2 diabetes
3471384 the study provides great insight into the risk factors that lead to the progression towards type 2 diabetes in this population
3471385 only by understanding how this devastating disease develops will be able to begin taking steps to prevent it
3471386 persistence of pre diabetes in overweight and obese hispanic children association with progressive insulin resistance poor beta cell function and increasing visceral fat
3471387 we have shown that with the use of current advanced high strength steels a vehicles body structure mass can be reduced by at least 25 percent
3471388 however with the new third generation steels now under development we expect to achieve more than 35 percent in structural mass reduction which will significantly help automakers improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
3471389 during the production stage of a vehicle a low density material such as aluminum will emit significantly more greenhouse gas emissions to the environment than steel

3471394 wow mom its gonna look like heaven in my bed
3471395 yeah i think so too because kids can play outside all night since its not dark we dont have to worry about coyotes either in heaven because everything is nice there
3471396 i did not set out to offend anybody but sometimes when you are making an r rated comedy that happens
3471397 that is not what i set out to do but i think the movie is good and it speaks for itself
3471398 the jokes are all in context of what some actors are willing to do to win an oscar
3471399 that is a longstanding joke in hollywood that certain types of roles like the one joked about in the film help put you in the minds and eyes of the academy voters and to what lengths some actors will go to bring one of those gold bad boys home
3471400 t heres a part of me thats a little puzzled and disappointed like where were you when came out because that was pretty offensive
3471401 or where were they when they made that the rules keep it clean and stay on the subject or we may delete your comment if you see inappropriate language
3471402 we need to pack up and go home and start living a christian life
3471403 people are walking away from sturgis with jesus in their hearts and he is going to begin to change their life
3471404 we have been obedient witnesses in a place that desperately needs it
3471405 im at a different place in my life right now
3471406 its the holy spirits job to draw them and then god to save them we are called to spread the good news thats what we do in sturgis
3471407 and that doesnt count the strengthening of the faith of the volunteers who endure hot weather long hours and little sleep
3471408 were very grateful for the volunteers as we are for those who partner financially with us as we reach out in this unique way to do gods kingdom work
3471409 where can i pray that prayer could you write it down so that i can pray it right now
3471410 i kept thinking about this all day it just wouldnt leave me alone i am ready to pray that prayer
3471411 just 10 minutes ago i received a call from back home my daughter was injured in an accident she has a broken arm and broken bones in her face i am a christian and was asking god to send someone for me to pray with
3471412 we are christians the holy spirit laid it on our hearts to come and pray with you about the evil that wants to stop this ministry
3471413 all of this would not be possible without the volunteers and partners who have taken this ministry from the vision of one leader to a group of leaders to a national level
3471414 folks who are physically not able to be at the rally are obedient witnesses by praying and by giving to the cooperative program which helped fund this through the north american mission board
3471415 god has called all of us as a family of southern baptists to impact the lostness that we see here in sturgis
3471416 we were able to have a connection with folks in other states by having them go online to this enabled churches and family members to visibly participate by praying they could see ministry happening as it unfolded
3471417 the training has been more effective and we have seen the result of this by the number of people who prayed to receive christ
3471418 the opening advance team was already in place so that new trainees could get right to work we had more seasoned volunteers and with the expanded time that the tent was open we were able to witness to more people
3471419 i saw this years organization had vastly improved the advantage of pre training on e quip and the power of prayer to fight the spiritual warfare made a difference there was a unified presence with the churches biker groups and individuals who volunteered
3471420 being able to see the engagement of the three minute testimony under the tent and the decisions that happen right before you built on the excitement for our group we had six weeks of training before we came up here we wanted to be prepared
3471421 it was exciting to see hearts engaged and the holy spirit change lives right in front of you as you pray with someone that you just met
3471422 volunteers were bending over backwards from the oklahoma chaplains to the f a i t h riders to our dbc family to help wherever needed it was neat to see so many willing to help out
3471423 this year we didnt have to look for opportunities to minister to vendors
3471424 we had vendors that came out of their spaces to ask us to pray with them one guy said where have you been last year you prayed for my business and it was profitable i need you to pray with me this year we could hardly make it down the street without someone stopping us and asking us to pray for them and with them
3471425 i have never won anything like this in my life
3471426 everywhere that i ride on this new bike i will be able to share how this harley was used to win over 1 300 people to christ

3471428 all other things being equal the simplest solution is the best
3471429 i think they were expecting to beat us by 50 or 60 points
3471430 we didnt expect to win but we wanted the game to be more balanced
3471431 our main goal was not to b s this game
3471432 we wanted to play hard not disrespect them and keep building on what were trying to do
3471433 this team here is more friendly than the 1992 team

3471437 after an incredibly successful summer of music led activity we felt it was right to put the crowning event in the hands of a music fan to help us develop the gig of their dreams
3471438 the synergy between music and gaming has never been closer and with all of the best music entertainment experiences available on xbox 360 we want to leave it to the fans to decide how the most exciting event of the year should roll out
3471439 shaula the postcard idea is a great one i would
3471440 and montreal is definitely in the plans even if its
3471441 it broke my heart to see all the highway signs
3471442 if you are in burlington its insanely close to mtl
3471443 the renovations are gorgeous in the last picture the people
3471444 very nice i much prefer older buildings and they seem
3471445 thank you handsome weve got a lot of good stories
3471446 we really dont know as much about obesity as we think we do
3471447 a considerable proportion of overweight and obese us adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3471448 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married
3471449 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
3471450 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
3471451 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
3471452 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child
3471453 carnal intercourse against the order of nature with another person of the same sex shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to 10 years
3471454 we have issued advertisements inviting applications to the post of coordinator people living with hiv aids plha only from candidates who are hiv positive earlier we had set this as a desirable factor but then we decided to make it an essential one
3471455 right now in kerala we have what is called drop in centres they work to facilitate grouping or association of people with hiv aids the belief is that when they come together they would get to share their problems and it would be a great relaxing factor
3471456 the aim of reserving the post is to reach out to them we believe that a lifestyle modification may be possible if somebody who understands their problem better is in charge it will also help us send out our message in a better way as the channel of communication will be better
3471457 this is a very positive step the best way to fight the disease is to break the confidentiality which is maintained by those affected by it to avoid the associated stigma
3471458 when nelson mandelas son died of aids he had said that the hiv affected should break the confidentiality
3471459 they should be encouraged to come forward as confidentiality can only lead to their isolation
3471460 the americans can call you all they want with their suggestions about you and me let them call you should understand something your security is based on the state of our relationship
3471461 i dont believe that we can get the right outcome in afghanistan as long as these militant sanctuaries exist across the border
3471462 at 19 years 15 of runners had died compared with 34 of controls
3471463 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3471464 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3471465 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3471466 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3471467 beijing olympics features over 10 500 athletes in perfect shape

3471469 weve never heard of this before we dont know how it got there
3471470 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear
3471471 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators
3471472 theres no possibility a greenland shark could predate a live adult white bear unless it was injured or seriously ill
3471473 greenland sharks do seem quite sluggish but they have been known to move very quickly when they are eating
3471474 the leaders met again tuesday but could not arrive at a workable formula or solution that would appease the people
3471475 the quota system can act as a barrier but there are cases when there are people who cannot be brought forward it helps them in getting them on board
3471476 we ought to take care of deprivation right now medical treatment primary education should be the focus and dependence on growth figures itself
3471477 but i dont think that these things are irreconcilable there are other patterns of progress possible

3471480 you need a sharp icktus on each note and a clear sharp tone
3471481 completely relax your upper arm and use the fingers and lower arm the elbow just pivots
3471482 dont even try it fast however tempting as it may be
3471483 we dont interfere in team selection but you cannot drop players for one bad series by the time the next selection committee is formed the equation might change though
3471484 everything will depend on the form and fitness of the seniors if sachin fails in one series it doesnt mean he will fail in all especially if he is back to full fitness
3471485 test cricket is tough its okay to play juniors in one dayers and twenty20 but its not the same in test cricket we need to groom them like we did with gautam gambhir he is now set if you want to make changes in the test team it has to be a process it cant be done after one bad series we dont work like that anyway
3471486 we have a month and a half to think about how we are going to get to the test series against australia still a lot of time to think and reflect on what went wrong here
3471487 after this series a couple of the seniors will certainly give it a thought about what happened in sri lanka its their call whether to stay and compete or gracefully retire
3471488 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3471489 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere

3471504 some reports of indian peacekeepers being involved in sexual exploitation including child abuse have been received by the indian army
3471505 in keeping with the efforts to ensure the highest standards of discipline and conduct by the indian peacekeepers the vice chief of army staff lt gen m l naidu during his visit to the indian brigade in monuc may 27 30 had directed that an internal inquiry be carried out by the commander there brigadier inderjeet narayan to examine the allegations and identify the defaulters if any
3471506 the inquiry is under judicial scrutiny and strict disciplinary action will be taken should any individual be found guilty
3471507 it has also been learnt that the office of internal oversight services oios of the un has also conducted an inquiry into the matter we would seek the details of this inquiry to corroborate augment the internal inquiry being conducted by the indian army
3471508 the indian army is committed to ensure that necessary disciplinary action is taken against the individuals if proved guilty

3471617 systems are going to go down its a fact of life whats important is to be prepared when those systems go down which is a major reason that some kind of offline access should be built into systems like email in theory well reach a time when the cloud really is always on but were not close and it may never happen

3471658 the fbi said that no individual associated with dugway was being investigated the anthrax sent by mail is a type known as the ames strain but its characteristics are such that it could have come from many potential sources including dugway
3471659 for nearly a decade u s army scientists at dugway proving ground in utah have made small quantities of weapons grade anthrax that is virtually identical to the powdery spores used in the mail attacks that have killed five people government sources say
3471660 dugways production of weapons grade anthrax which has never before been publicly revealed is apparently the first by the u s government since president richard m nixon ordered the u s offensive biowarfare program closed in 1969

3471741 i feel it is not appropriate in australian society and culture to wear the hijaab if it is not necessary to wear it why separate yourself from the community youre trying to fit into
3471742 there are some people in todays society that feel threatened by difference and this feeling makes them uncomfortable and so they dont want to ask questions and find out the truth they just want to be as far from it the hijab as possible

3471754 id like to share my own personal experience as further reinforcing the need for the mammogram
3471755 breast cancer should not be a disease that one views as shameful or something not to talk about

3471770 to get a bang from these steps in the short term you really have to spend a lot of money
3471771 as i was crouching over valenzuela he began to bite at my lower right leg
3471772 i felt his teeth graze up against my lower leg through my pant leg i immediately punched valenzuela in the head in an attempt to stop his biting at the same instance officer schwartz saw that valenzuela was attempting to bite me he kicked the subject in an attempt to stop him from biting me as i arose to my feet i could still see valenzuela attempting to bite me this time i kicked him in the head
3471773 i instinctively struck him in the face with my right fist to prevent him from spitting on me again as he was full of blood
3471774 magnolia got me focused on the idea of music and movies in a different way
3471775 i started looking at songwriting from a different angle 2005s concept album the forgotten arm i wrote as a sort of soundtrack to an imaginary movie its a great way of looking at songwriting it gets me out of my own head and into the head of another character i dont have to write about myself all the time
3471776 he wrote a song that works great as a duet
3471777 he played guitar he sang on it he did the harmony parts its perfect its incredibly perfectly tuned
3471778 the theme of the song is running into someone you havent seen in a while and anyway he and i are singing that to one another now on this record
3471779 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3471780 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3471781 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3471782 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic
3471783 you know mike mckenzie and kenny chesney are from the opposite ends of the earth and yet here they are that one afternoon and kenny notices mikes wearing the same clothes hes been in all day from his rehab and id love to see this but chesneys undressing mckenzie

3471787 i am a canadian citizen so i think of canada as my own country
3471788 we work closely with the canadian government we really appreciate all that canada does and we look forward to their continued efforts to make the situation better
3471789 we are not asking to separate from iraq we can live together if dialogue will happen
3471790 as assyrians we would like to see iraq be one but wed also like to have an administrative zone this is only to ensure that we as an ethnic religious and linguistic minority survive even canada has minority provisions for its minorities a minority cannot survive if it is engulfed within the majority
3471791 with our blood and soul we will defend the cross
3471792 the monks have been released but fighting is still ongoing
3471793 this incident is not separate from the tensions that exist in and around minya groups of muslims and copts live in the mountains and are little warlords in themselves
3471794 they split into several groups one group proceeded to destroy the wall others entered a chapel used by the monks and destroyed and burned property
3471795 negotiating a consensual resolution to the land dispute in abu fana is a welcome if tragically overdue initiative
3471796 but the serious crimes committed in the context of that dispute must not go unpunished if the government is serious about preventing their recurrence
3471797 sustained broken bones muscle tears and bruises due to physical blows whipping dragging and pelting with stones
3471798 we are not contesting the governments insistence that the abu fana land dispute did not start for religious reasons
3471799 but kidnapping and abusing monks denigrating their beliefs and destroying their church are all heinous crimes committed on sectarian grounds and could constitute dangerous precedents if left without punishment
3471800 sure i am questioning whether the government is taking this sort of thing seriously
3471801 what is happening is that the government is allowing people to take things into their own hands and that results in more violence
3471802 in the war on terrorism intelligence has replaced the cold wars tanks and fighter planes as the primary weapon against an unseen enemy
3471803 could inflict far more damage to national security than soviet spies
3471804 investigators suspect espionage is probable as she produced highly sensitive health hazard documents for toxic compounds and chemical pesticides tehseen also was an expert in parasitology as it relates to public water systems
3471805 there is no escaping the unfortunate fact that muslim government employees in law enforcement the military and the diplomatic corps need to be watched for connections to terrorism
3471806 one hundred mps have given their confidence to the cabinet five voted against and two abstained
3471807 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land
3471808 raising the question of the resistances arms is no longer justified
3471809 our national duty dictates the continuation of the resistance and the prevention of any attempt to weaken it
3471810 there has been a very significant reinforcement of hezbollah in recent years and we are examining the possibility that the balance of power has shifted with the introduction of sophisticated weapons from syria
3471811 we have not achieved peace yet but we have achieved a provisional cease fire of hostilities
3471812 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people
3471813 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3471814 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3471815 i think that these are some very good principles in order to resolve the problem which has arisen from this very dramatic situation and these principles can be used by georgia and south ossetia
3471816 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3471817 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3471818 their western aggression barbarism and state sponsored terrorism not only in palestine iraq and afghanistan but also in bosnia and various south american countries have surpassed all records known to human history
3471819 t he de facto power in these nations pakistan and saudi arabia are political islamic movements this makes these leaders ineffective in stopping these nations from being fountainheads of terror
3471820 even in those days aggressive jihads were waged because it was truly commendable for establishing the grandeur of the religion of allah
3471821 jihad insurgency or whatever you want to call it in kashmir yes pakistan may have helped the jihad at some time but it was not started by us
3471822 all assistance to the people of kashmir and support its steadfast struggle
3471823 spectacular growth after 1982 lay in the support it gained from islamists in west asia notably the kuwait based world association of muslim youth and the saudi arabia funded international islamic federation of student organizations
3471824 s ubsidizing pakistans terrorism training infrastructure and isi terrorist operations by a whole host of islamic fundamentalist terrorist outfits against india
3471825 funds are available for the asking for let not only from pakistan but also from
3471826 of course im still comfortable with it its still my forecast
3471827 its not true just in the united states its true in europe in terms of slowing growth that being said what weve seen in the last nine months is our business being pretty normal
3471828 atom is off to a very very rapid start far exceeding our expectations when we started the year
3471829 its the perfect recession product to have in the marketplace
3471830 it plays very well in the mobile marketplace it plays in emerging markets it plays into peoples desire to have a second pc or one for the kids thats low coast yet sill capable
3471831 i just kind of had fun with it and that helped a lot
3471832 it almost didnt feel like the olympic games that was probably good in a sense
3471833 it was a great show and i hope we have many more
3471834 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
3471835 the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs

3471841 its less about party affiliation and more about issues and personal
3471842 everyone recognizes the fact that weve got to cross party lines we have got to cross every thing that divides us in order to pull together and push this region forward
3471843 there is serious work to do at the county and i dont have time to have press conferences every other day just to announce a few people who are supporting me
3471844 i expect that in the second half of this year we willbroach zero growth
3471845 im hardly the only writer who has benefitted greatly from his support and criticism and who misses him and who owes him a debt of gratitude for all kinds of things i hope that something of him his work his memory hopefully both will survive the ravages caused by all the past and future losses weve faced and have yet to face not to mention all the forgetfulness weve had to learn to do just to get through our lives with any pleasure at all
3471846 everyone laughs at gary sullivans drawings of poets on the cover of the spd catalog
3471847 in this book another of my favorites steve pastiches together biographical fragments of various writers and artists by keeping the artists anonymous and interspersing off hand observations from his own life steve underlines the randomness of lives small and great that make biography such a fascinating literary form
3471848 i read biographies the woes of geniuses and stars cheer me up destiny in a dewdrop more harmonious than a song a few pages and x moves from agony to greatness then death how neatly it ties things up but tiny unexpected details appeal most elvis brief moment of rebellion against col parker when the singer showed just a flicker of interest in the occult

3471852 i let a big third down play go early on i dropped one
3471853 after that i went to the sideline and told him it was my fault and i told him it wont happen again he knows that he trusts me and as you see he kept throwing the ball to me
3471854 after i came out a lot of guys were really positive about how i played which feels good
3471855 it feels good to know that i have the support of not only the management which i think has been proven in the public eye but the guys as well which is very important to me
3471856 the interception we couldve caught the ball a couple of dropped passes overall he played great he led the offense and thats all we can ask for
3471857 he was probably more excited than anyone else to get in front of the home crowd and just show em what he can do
3471858 i told him youre a better man than most people because most people wouldnt be able to handle the situation the way he handled it he handled it just like a grown man and said the right things it seems to have worked out for him
3471859 he did some wonderful things for green bay some wonderful things it was that time im not sure i dont know the entire situation of what really went on but hes gone its aarons time now and they need to give him a chance dont compare aaron rodgers to brett favre he has to make his own shoes make his own set of footprints and make his own success but i think hell be all right he looked pretty good tonight

3471871 the focus for aci has been on cash flow and it wasdisappointing to see that they had negative cash flow

3471876 what we need is a critique of visual culture that is alert to the power of images for good and evil and that is capable of discriminating the variety and historical specificity of their uses
3471877 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
3471878 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
3471879 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
3471880 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
3471881 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
3471882 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
3471883 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
3471884 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
3471885 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
3471886 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
3471887 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
3471888 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
3471889 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
3471890 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
3471891 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
3471892 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
3471893 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
3471894 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
3471895 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
3471896 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
3471897 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
3471898 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
3471899 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
3471900 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
3471901 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
3471902 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
3471903 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
3471904 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
3471905 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
3471906 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
3471907 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
3471908 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
3471909 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make

3471954 in the 60s when tim leary and i began exploring inner space with psychedelics the music was always a groove that we could follow a route to take us higher music was at the forefront of the expansion of consciousness and the counter culture there was a group consciousness that evolved in some of the performances of the grateful dead jefferson airplane jimi hendrix and others that was transcendent and brought a sense of unity and a feeling of deep love and joy later when i made it to india i was introduced to other music and sounds that vibrate with the cosmos using it to get high the music itself is the high and you just become it like a surfer becoming one with the wave
3471955 not since the late terence mckennas alien dreamtime album in the early 90s has enlightened spirituality flowed so well with contemporary chill out and this time each track is separate a manageable length and broadcast friendly for the most part the music dominates without diminishing the power of ram dass messages without being overly preachy ram dass expressive words give new meaning and interest to this energized yet inspirational musical environment while dj krieces deftly selected grooves bring new life and focus to some universal and timeless spoken truths
3471956 this collaboration makes this blend of music and spirituality available to a new generation kriece has brought together the influences of world music chanting electronics and spoken word i am honored he has used words i spoke though it is only us talking to ourselves this mixdown of mantra and electronica merges into one love

3471968 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3471969 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3471970 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3471971 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic

3471997 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go
3471998 if it was a big city marathon or even a world championships id say do not push it
3471999 but i do not want to sit there watching it on television wondering what could have happened
3472000 there have been times when i did not think i would make it so i will be the happiest of all the runners on the start line
3472001 the only reason i would not able to finish the marathon it would be if my leg could not handle it
3472002 but i have been encouraged because my leg has been coping with good amounts of running
3472003 id rather go in like this than the shape i was in back in 2004 when i was not well
3472004 it certainly means that i have a lot of unfinished business with the olympics
3472005 it was my dream as a little girl you dont dream about world championships you dream about the olympics
3472006 regardless of what happened four years ago this still would have been something i fought for
3472007 i have not taken stupid risks with my leg but at every point i have tested it and pushed it a bit further because youre taking a gamble
3472008 you have to ask yourself are you prepared for the worst thing that can happen
3472009 and for me the worst thing is not to be able to finish the race and i have already faced that in athens
3472010 hes tried his heart out with a young horse you never know how they are going to react ive had him since he was four and planned his career for this hes never seen anything like this but he really tried his heart out this means the world to me its what you dream about
3472011 i was not surprised that i was not chosen the others were much more experienced horses but i knew that if i was given the chance i good do a good job
3472012 he felt a but quiet at the last line turning away from the exit he had not had a show jumping fence down since 2005 so it was a pity he had to do it here

3472016 some of my close military buddies doing wild and crazy things while i film them
3472017 viewers and fans of mystraightbuddy com have routinely been given access to a very different side of our men in and out of uniform
3472018 i fell in love with joes work the moment i first laid eyes on his website
3472019 what joe has done is something so different from what ive done with active duty yet the two complement each other so well joes work covers a side of the military niche that active duty only scrapes the surface on joe focuses on the men and their personalities even if it means leaving out the sex and theres something just as fucking sexy about that approach
3472020 having actually spent time in the military i know what really goes on the casual nudity drunk horseplay and intense camaraderie of men that spend so much time together
3472021 watching these videos really lets you experience what its like to have straight military buddies who are such tight friends they really do hang out naked and chill together these are real best friends comfortable and relaxed its a unique approach but one that has really paid off you wouldnt believe how well it converts people are looking for something thats different and real

3472040 it is unclear whether these results would apply to today western male populations who unlike the men in the scandinavian prostate cancer group study number 4 trial are diagnosed with prostate cancer mainly by prostate specific antigen screening
3472041 contrary to our predictions based on shorter follow up the absolute difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastasis and prostate cancer death did not further increase after seven to nine years of follow up
3472042 the relative reduction in all cause mortality following radical prostatectomy also decreased over time
3472043 radical prostatectomy reduces prostate cancer mortality and the risk of metastases with little or no further increase in benefit 10 or more years after surgery
3472044 cure with radical prostatectomy is possible may be necessary and should generally be recommended
3472045 results are less certain for men older than 65 years or with limited life expectancies due to comorbidities

3472131 congressman leach is well respected across the state of iowa by republicans democrats and independents alike and we are honored to have his support
3472132 this election is about changing the way washington does business and many republicans like congressman leach understand america cannot afford another four years of the failed policies of the bush administration
3472133 while he is very well respected in the iowa city cedar rapids and davenport area his endorsement doesnt carry much weight unless hes willing to make some appearances and work to get his former supporters to back obama

3472160 it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev
3472161 president sarkozy won the kremlins agreement today on the conditions for a cessation of hostilities in georgia that would see both sides return to their initial positions before fighting erupted last week a six point plan endorsed by president medvedev during a visit by the french leader to moscow calls on both russia and georgia to end all hostilities and allow free access for humanitarian assistance

3472168 what is most interesting is that mccains chief foreign policy aide randy scheunemann has been advising lobbying for pro western georgia for the last four years cant you just imagine what happened
3472169 at the same time aware of the serious possibilities of a mass uprising by a population already hit badly economically in case of further sanctions decided by the united nations security council and respected by the international community the regime tries by taking one step forward and two backward to protract as much time as possible the negotiations with the five permanent members of the security council and germany concerning its controversial nuclear activities
3472170 so after yesterdays disappointing performance what are your thoughts for today
3472171 russian troops have entered georgias black sea port of poti an oil and cargo shipping centre georgian prime minister lado gurgenidze said on monday according to our information russian troops have entered poti as well as being in senaki and zugdidi he said in a televised address referring to two other towns in western georgia
3472172 regardless of what happens next it is worth asking what the bush people were thinking when they egged on mikheil saakashvili georgias young western educated president to apply for nato membership send 2 000 of his troops to iraq as a full fledged u s ally and receive tactical training and weapons from our military did they really think putin would sit by and see another border state and former province of the russian empire slip away to the west if they thought that putin might not what did they plan to do about it and how firmly did they warn saakashvili not to get too brash or provoke an outburst
3472173 pickles from around the world and around the corner music exhibitions demonstrations and fun
3472174 the indian strategic nuclear submarine project an open literature analysis
3472175 what we can tell is there were three fatalities in the aircraft as to what happened as to what may have transpired prior to that we dont know at this point
3472176 i knew he was in trouble obviously at that altitude and attitude nose down like that that is not a maneuver they would ever do in an area like this on a day like this
3472177 people were running in the parking lot like they heard the plane and they were running before it hit i dont believe anybody on the ground was hurt
3472178 i saw a plane just going very straight no landing gear and it just nose dived in one second it completely blew up with one big ball of flames
3472179 i saw the plane going around and i think he was trying to land they were going to use the parking lot to land
3472180 from when i first heard it to when i saw it the pilot did maneuver he turned but i dont know what was going inside the cockpit at the time
3472181 all we heard was a loud boom and we werent sure if it was the dumpster out back being emptied or a heavy truck traveling past our building or whatnot
3472182 our deepest sympathies and thoughts are prayers are with the families right now

3472192 unfortunately in the ethnic cleansing being carried out by the burmese military junta in eastern burma rape is being used as a tool of war as it is in darfur
3472193 the obvious purpose in my view is to destroy the fabric of the community if the women are raped they are obviously shamed in the eyes of their community often times the husbands divorce the women who are left alone
3472194 victimised by the fighters and then be victimised by the men that you love
3472195 it is very very painful and for the women it is pain you live with all your life
3472196 as for the girls you can imagine the trauma and sometimes i would look at the eyes of the women in the camp and just wonder whether she is one of those who was raped and what is going on in her heart and mind
3472197 within the space of the hour that i had with them ive heard of seven tell the stories of their gang rape
3472198 one woman was 35 years old and she had been raped by several of the janjaweed arab militia in sudan and by the time she saw her husband he already knew she was raped and he divorced her on the spot leaving her with eight children
3472199 obviously if you do this to enough communities you destroy the family you destroy the fabric of a community and if you do it throughout enough villages you can shred the fabric of an ethnic group which is what they are doing in darfur and which is what they have done in the eastern part of burma
3472200 its unknowable when a deal will be reached but the president is due back from zimbabwe later today
3472201 since their formation the zimbabwe defence forces have remained steadfast in defending our national sovereignty territorial integrity and interests as well as our hard won independence
3472202 these sterling achievements have overcome numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community to destabilise our peace and stability and thus cause confusion in our country
3472203 positive sentiment seen at the end of the first quarter that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived
3472204 in the second half of this year ubs does not expect to see any improvement in the adverse economic and financial market trends that affected this quarters results
3472205 the good news in these results is the break up of the group into three autonomous units because this allows for an eventual sale or part sale of the investment bank
3472206 we think we have reached the trough of the wave on the net new money outflow that would take time to come back to a more normal level
3472207 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3472208 others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity
3472209 no theologian has done more to inflame christian resentment of secular political culture
3472210 it now feels so natural such a normal thing to do
3472211 our responsibility is to be faithful to the task god has given us the result of that task is gods doing
3472212 members will be advocates for human liberation by being themselves liberated its actions for reconciliation justice and peace will be and will be seen to be the overflow of a life in christ where gods reconciliation justice and peace are already and experienced reality in their communal life together
3472213 it will only be by movements that begin with the local congregation in which the reality of the new creation is present known and experienced and from which all ages will go into every sector of public life to claim it for christ by being present as the story of jesus it is the local congregation dispersed that will unmask the illusions which have remained hidden and will expose all areas of public life to the illumination of the gospel
3472214 you can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you can not fool all of the people all of the time
3472215 the first is not to resort to the use of force the second is to halt all military action the third is free access to humanitarian aid the fourth is that georgian armed forces should return to their bases the fifth is that russian armed forces should pull back to their positions prior to combat
3472216 the sixth is the beginning of international discussions on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia and on ways to ensure their security
3472217 they will give an unequivocal answer an answer that cannot be given by russia or any other country
3472218 as to the statement made by the georgian president that a ceasefire has been in place for two days this is a lie
3472219 if russia had had another way to react to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have done this there was no other way to respond

3472245 the mobile telecommunications industry is understandably very concerned that a very limited analysis of this kind must be read with a full understanding and clear disclosure of the constraints of its information sources and the conclusions heavily qualified to avoid a totally misleading impression of the actual situation

3472265 now it is far from obvious from a logical point of view that we are justified in inferring universal statement from singular ones no matter how numeours for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false no matter how many instances of white swans we may have observed this does not justify the conclusions that all swans are white

3472280 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3472281 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3472282 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3472283 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3472284 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3472285 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3472286 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3472290 call on me in the day of troub le i will deliv er you and you shall honor and glori fy me
3472291 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3472292 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3472293 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3472294 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3472295 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3472296 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3472297 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

3472301 bandingkan dengan negara negara lain yang umumnya sudah di atas rp 1 triliun bahkan china re sudah memiliki modal sekitar rp 54 triliun
3472302 juga diharapkan memanasnya suku politik tahun depan menjelang pemilu 2009 tidak sampai menimbulkan huru hara dan kerusuhan jika terjadi kerusuhan sehingga risiko asuransi meningkat perusahaan asuransi akan cenderung menahan ekspansinya akibatnya pertumbuhan premi akan tetap lambat
3472303 bila tingkat produksi ini mampu dipertahankan pertumbuhan premi tahun 2007 diperkirakan berada pada kisaran 25 30 persen atau melebihi pencapaian tahun lalu
3472304 banyak pula orang orang dewasa indonesia yang masih tinggal dengan orangtuanya atau dengan kata lain belum memiliki kemandirian
3472305 banyak negara lain yang sudah melakukannya langkah ini akan menguntungkan pemerintah karena akan makin banyak dana dana jangka panjang yang tersedia untuk pembangunan infrastruktur
3472306 manfaat yang diterima masyarakat dari klaim mencapai rp 8 19 triliun meningkat 17 persen dibandingkan tahun lalu yang sebesar rp 7 triliun
3472307 penetapan kenaikan tarif premi asuransi kendaraan bermotor akan tetap dilanjutkan namun saya akan mensosialisasikan kembali keputusan pemerintah tentang perubahan aturan tarif asuransi itu karena banyak penjelasan yang tidak tepat
3472308 kalau kondisi ini dibiarkan akan ada bahayanya yakni kalau ada klaim bisa terjadi kegagalan bayar kepada konsumen
3472309 jumlah dana kompensasi phk yang terakumulasi dari kasus kasus ini mencapai rp 500 miliar ini yang harus diatasi agar tidak terjadi bencana pesangon karena pengusaha tidak membayar hak phk buruhnya
3472310 kami ingin menerapkannya bertahap karena dana ini bisa dikembangkan untuk kegiatan yang mencegah pengangguran bentuk jaminan sosial seperti ini akan memberi tiga keuntungan pengaman sosial untuk buruh menyokong kekuatan devisa negara dan meningkatkan kesejahteraan buruh lewat pengembangan dana
3472311 meskipun ada peran swasta sebagai penyelenggara sosial pemerintah tetap tidak boleh lepas tangan sepenuhnya keterlibatan pemerintah tetap dibutuhkan karena asuransi sosial sebenarnya merupakan salah satu bentuk kewajiban pemerintah untuk melindungi rakyatnya
3472312 jadi penyelenggara asuransi sosial harus memikirkan cara untuk mencegah timbulnya pengangguran hanya dengan berlandaskan pola pengelolaan dana sosial seperti itu asuransi sosial bisa menjadi salah satu kekuatan keuangan nasional
3472313 pemerintah harus segera menyehatkan perasuransian dan perbankan nasional agar bisa bersinergi menggerakkan perekonomian
3472314 pemerintah daerah bisa menerbitkan semacam surat utang daerah untuk mendapat dana segar guna merealisasikan proyek tersebut lembaga pengelola dana sosial bisa membeli surat utang tersebut sebagai instrumen investasi yang sekaligus bermanfaat menciptakan lapangan kerja
3472315 kalau bisa diimplementasikan lembaga pengelola dana pekerja bisa berinvestasi sekaligus mendukung penciptaan lapangan pekerjaan bagi masyarakat jika perusahaan asuransi menggunakan prinsip ini mengelola dana cadangan pesangon pekerja pasti menguntungkan apalagi kalau melihat potensi dana yang bisa dikumpulkan rp 70 triliun bukan jumlah sedikit akan tetapi apabila pengelola menghitung risiko jumlah pesangon yang harus dibayar jika terjadi phk massal tentu tak ada perusahaan asuransi yang berani
3472316 14th indonesia rendezvous 2007 yang bakal digelar di bali mengambil tema
3472317 yang menarik negara dengan tingkat optimisme tinggi ternyata tidak diikuti dengan kesiapan mereka terhadap masa depan dengan melakukan program perencanaan
3472318 orang indonesia yang masuk di level menengah lebih lambat lagi yakni nanti pada usia 49 tahun
3472319 meskipun melakukan persiapan yang lebih baik mereka tetap khawatir juga karena untuk biaya hidup di masa depan itu juga cukup tinggi
3472320 jadi tujuan dari outlook index ini adalah untuk memberikan gambaran kepada kita tentang optimisme dan persiapan persiapan mass affluent di asia menyangkut empat aspek itu yakni karier keluarga kesehatan dan pensiun
3472321 masyarakat ingin belajar lebih banyak bagaimana mengelola masa depan secara efektif dan mulai merencanakan lebih awal dan lebih cerdas
3472322 life outlook index menyajikan sebuah patokan yang dapat membantu industri untuk mengidentifikasi tren jangka panjang yang digambarkan dari pandangan terkini masyarakat mengenai masa depan juga menyediakan kita pengetahuan yang berbeda mengenai produk seperti perencanaan pendidikan asuransi kesehatan dan perencanaan pensiun yang merupakan fokus masyarakat berpenghasilan tinggi kaya dari masing masing pasar
3472323 implikasi perubahan sistem itu sangat banyak kami harus membuat kajian dari berbagai aspek

3472376 i started out more painterly now its more sculptural im trying to be clean if you want to hang it in your house you dont want it to fall off the wall art professors will tell you thats not important but it is
3472377 as a product of americas plastic throwaway culture it seems prophetic that im best at making art from stuff that people dont want stuff they no longer need but dont quite throw away as the world becomes more polluted with this type of refuse i see this process as a type of alchemist pursuit this transformative activity can also be seen as a metaphor to how we as humans interact with the earth the residue of this process is sometimes called art
3472378 its kind of a sickness because once you start with garbage you really dont want to throw it away
3472379 i have four projects going because i have four stools if i had six id have six
3472380 its always kind of a work in progress if i can live with it then im ok there are others that hit a note like a tuning fork it hits a note i dont ever get tired of looking at it

3472383 saya belum pernah ikut asuransi apa pun sampai sekarang saya juga tidak tahu bagaimana prosedur mengikuti asuransi sebenarnya saya tertarik ikut asuransi
3472384 sebenarnya kalau ada brosur brosur tentang asuransi yang dikirimkan ke rumah atau di tempat tempat umum itu lumayan untuk informasi
3472385 yang diasuransikan terutama bangunan ya sebagai pengusaha saya harus mulai berpikir untuk membagi risiko bila terjadi sesuatu apalagi padang ini memang daerah gempa
3472386 asuransi itu membuat komitmen untuk saya komitmen untuk membayar premi ini harus dipatuhi demi perlindungan masa depan kalau tidak mungkin seluruh keuntungan habis untuk perluasan modal usaha
3472387 dengan asuransi pendidikan ini saya tidak perlu pusing pusing bertanya uang yang dibutuhkan anak untuk bayar kuliah sekarang mereka tinggal numpang tinggal di rumah saja
3472388 secara umum asuransi yang dipakai di padang masih sebatas asuransi kebakaran asuransi untuk bencana belum banyak dipakai karena premi asuransi yang tergolong besar yakni 2 5 persen
3472389 how did this delay in certification result in us having to take a 1 3 million charge during the quarter
3472390 if you disabled these cards how much in the way of transaction count is that going to cost you for revenue
3472391 a new study suggests that a surprising number of overweight people about half have normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels while an equally startling number of trim people suffer from some of the ills associated with obesity
3472392 in the study about 51 percent of overweight adults or roughly 36 million people nationwide had mostly normal levels of blood pressure cholesterol blood fats called triglycerides and blood sugar almost one third of obese adults or nearly 20 million people also were in this healthy range meaning that none or only one of those measures was abnormal
3472393 you have no reason to i didnt sleep with her i swear
3472394 but she asked you to she came on to you
3472395 if you knew id never know and lydia would never know you would
3472396 so you deprived her of one last pleasure because you were afraid of getting caught
3472397 but at least hes already got his own house number
3472398 i see beyond this deal this is a temporary situation
3472399 apart from being a logistical nightmare the main concern among many is how all these planned major overhauls of the building would impact on the substantive work of the world body particularly its reform agenda and the millennium development goals mdgs
3472400 with the anticipated considerable disruption of even the normal work of the staff who would be housed in various swing spaces the much needed headquarters leadership would be seriously constrained as the mdgs target year of 2015 gets close
3472401 can you imagine how an organisation with more than 4 000 staffers spread all over the city would be able to handle effectively even partially its high profile responsibility to achieve these goals
3472402 i dont know the details of the renovation and how it will be phased but i have the impression that it will be a big headache for everyone including of course ngos
3472403 this is primarily not because of bad planning by the united nations as i understand it but because there is a huge amount of construction work to be done work that has been put off for a very long time
3472404 the project met a level of consideration for blasts that would make the building very safe
3472405 it is good that the actual work for that has commenced now i hope the so called capital master plan can keep its time frame for completion of the work within the next five years
3472406 but unfortunately that rejection happened when the united nations was reeling from the oil for food scandal in iraq and while the u n s relations with the new york state legislators were at the lowest
3472407 well may be the critics would say that the disruption of the u n s work would not be noticed at all given the minimalist agenda it is now pursuing
3472408 they will make their way in the confusion they will find the u n missions still open for business in the same place the receptions will not be any less the secretariat staff will be found for interaction in some new and temporary niche in the neighbourhood and life will go on
3472409 lets hope there will be a slightly new tilt in washington that will mean a bit more space for international cooperation and multilateral discourse
3472410 likes to shop at target and play with her dog
3472411 the reason is that it is a complete satire and in real life jenna and husband james is nothing like the character she portrays which interestingly enough has the same name
3472412 im still looking forward as much as ever to lollilove in a week and a half but for now which episode would any of you say is the best example of jenna as an innocent sweet receptionist
3472413 so we could get it done its been a long couple of weeks
3472414 we are still investigating but everything points to what has been reported that this looks like an accident
3472415 the medic crew said the child was barely breathing his body felt like rubber
3472416 it looks like they never got around to taking advantage of the things they were offered
3472417 childrens services was just not confident that these parents could care for these children
3472418 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3472419 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3472420 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3472421 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3472422 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3472423 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political

3472453 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3472455 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

3472457 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3472458 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3472459 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3472460 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3472461 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3472462 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3472463 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3472464 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3472465 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3472466 the armed forces of abkhazia have reached the border with georgia in the kodori gorge
3472467 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3472468 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3472469 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3472470 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3472471 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3472472 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3472473 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3472474 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3472475 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3472476 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3472477 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3472478 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3472479 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3472480 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3472481 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3472482 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3472483 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3472484 the open ended nature of the content of what if will spur creative thinking and children will love the colorful vibrant illustrations which are every bit as playful and original as the writing
3472485 what if and dont pick your nose have engaging prose and enchanting illustrations they capture the imagination and make reading fun with adults teachers and children all flocking to these books you can be assured that they are winners
3472486 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3472487 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3472488 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

3472493 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3472494 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3472495 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3472496 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3472497 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3472498 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3472499 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3472500 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3472501 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3472544 physical therapists are often one of the first health care providers that patients with acute low back pain encounter whether they are referred by medical doctors or visit them directly which offers evidenced based pts a tremendous opportunity to help patients recover
3472545 considering that low back pain will affect between sixty and eighty percent of americans during their lifetime the potential cost savings of an early effective intervention to prevent individuals from progressing to chronic disability may be considerable
3472546 the findings from this research can be applied throughout all fields of medicine not just to physical therapy
3472547 if all physicians and therapists adhere to their fields recommended clinical practice guidelines they too should see a decrease in subsequent health care utilization it is our hope that this research will help physical therapists as well as all medical professionals do their job more effectively
3472548 it should be pretty easy for video game developers to integrate our research into new games as a game developer myself i know first hand that stretched out and flickering backgrounds and details are no longer acceptable in 3d video games
3472549 people are looking for ways to get rid of these distortions preferably without having to pay artists to generate background and detail images by hand we have come up with a way to do this and we are planning to provide code for download soon
3472550 the existing methods for using computer generated noise to make images for backgrounds and details for 3d video games are fast but the images that you get dont look very good our work gives you the full computational benefit of noise but without many of the tradeoffs such as distortion and flickering
3472551 the graphics generated from the procedural approach that we explored in this project are very small illustrating video games with small images is going to be increasingly important in the future as more and more games are downloadable

3472668 the u s is now the worlds largest wind energy producer with wind development sparking job creation and economic opportunity in a troubled economy
3472669 but the current figures hide a dire reality the pipeline of investment for 2009 has been on hold for months with escalating risks and costs for the industry because of the uncertainty about the production tax credit at a time when unemployment is at a 4 year high and the economy needs every stimulus it can get a rapid extension of the credit should be on any economic priority list for congress
3472670 its clear that wind power is not only a major technology with which to fight climate change but also one of the most promising and dynamic economic engines we have today
3472671 the nation needs an ambitious plan to promote the deployment of wind and other renewable energy technologies and the urgent first step it must take is to rapidly extend the expiring renewable energy credits which are the primary incentive that the nation provides for these technologies today

3472679 i didnt understand the dark knight i still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy

3472682 we now know this is frank marshall davis a full fledged communist of the strongest kind he is one of the few in america who did not leave the communist party after stalin was revealed for the monster he was obama seemed to be trying to hide this by not naming him directly

3472690 peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts no further comment from either will be forthcoming
3472691 when peaches went out to the us im not sure she planned to get married she just wanted to spend some more time with max they have been together since the itunes festival but not many people knew about it only their close circle of friends and family peaches dad knew about the wedding and he is perfectly happy

3472700 basically i dont think we know the right answer about what to do
3472701 more men die with their prostate cancer than of it
3472702 i have discussions with a patient about his other medical conditions his age his willingness to receive treatment that may have long term side effects weighed against the risk that he may develop an aggressive cancer

3472752 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3472753 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3472754 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3472755 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3472756 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3472758 as arbitron improves the sampling i think ppm will become widely accepted much like the diary methodology in the 1970s
3472759 the test scores show that in the diary methodology only six radio stations had a cume of 1 million people or more with ppm 21 stations had a cume of 1 million or more
3472760 so that goes to show you how much radio is used its used on a greater scale than what people believe
3472761 we had been having ongoing discussions on this for several months
3472762 theyre doing really well theres been significant growth in that group of stations and there will be more
3472763 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3472764 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3472765 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3472766 we are so fuckin stoked beyond belief to be main support to metallica in america were speechless dream come true type shit lets fuckin tear america to pieces

3472812 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game

3472848 they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3472849 if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3472850 what weve done is make the same molecules from renewable sources so that it can go into the existing infrastructure be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way thats the goal
3472851 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference
3472852 i doubt were going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil but well certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term
3472853 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold
3472854 it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3472855 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3472856 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3472857 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3472858 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3472859 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum

3472862 provide resources for students to investigate questions of business and managements role in society
3472863 this experience foreshadows what is to come in the next two years
3472864 to become successful in business it is essential that students engage themselves both personally and professionally in the community
3472865 a commitment to community is an integral part of the tuck education and tradition and i can think of no better introduction to this place than tuckbuilds
3472866 it is a uniquely appropriate way to begin ones tuck journey
3472867 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3472868 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3472869 they would come talk to us given our ability to tax efficient transaction for both parties we have good dialogue with them

3472904 using that as a planning document a document that we can use and go forward for the discussion of what the priorities of public safety are throughout the city of tulsa and where they fit in with other things that are trying to be funded
3472905 there is no funding formula attached to it they have made a recommendation of what they believe that we need based on their expertise
3472906 letting the report stand on its own because it is the first time we have had an objective analysis of this in some time
3472907 mgt of america in my opinion did a pretty good job of that
3472908 it gives us a target it gives us something to talk about it gives us all an opportunity to say well we believe that is good or bad and we can move forward to our idea of what public safety will be in the future
3472909 my promise to our customers has always been the same to consistently provide the industrys highest quality best tasting beef with a commitment to environmentally sound practices humane animal treatment and personal integrity i stand behind this commitment the best way i know by putting my name on everything we sell
3472910 most of the beef was sold at grocers other than whole foods and recalled this summer an additional 1 2 million pounds were recalled on friday by the processor after illnesses in several states were tentatively linked to ground beef sold at whole foods and other stores
3472911 we are seeing a significant strengthening by hezbollah in the past few years
3472912 were monitoring any possibility of a shift in balance of power due to the syrians supplying hezbollah with advanced weapons systems
3472913 during the interview barak also said the 2006 second lebanon war in effect carried out to stop hezbollah armament had actually strengthened the lebanon based militant group
3472914 sharon and his leadership were wise not to respond to hezbollahs strengthening

3472932 rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem
3472933 growth in health related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing state and local governments as well unsustainable growth in health care spending also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercuts their ability to compete in a global marketplace

3472941 the pkk is powerful enough to dictate a solution to the kurdish problem a democratic solution could be possible if people and guerillas put up effective resistance
3472942 will resort to every possible method to create a dispute between us and the united states and political parties in southern kurdistan northern iraq because experience it gained in the past decade showed it that it could not defeat kurdish guerillas without external support
3472943 we cannot say that our relations with powers in south kurdistan are not satisfactory we are going through a period when more positive developments than negative ones could be witnessed from the standpoint of kurdish people we can say that the powers in south kurdistan encourage turkey by making wrongheaded statements
3472944 we will continue targeting all those police officials who are taking part in the ongoing military operation against us

3472948 this is a call to the sudanese to rid themselves of the erroneous sufi ideology and revert to salafism it doesnt make sense to engage in the faulty sufi ritual heresy while the whole infidel world order is conspiring against sudan
3472949 dont underestimate sudan sudanese people are mostly religious contrary to the people in the gulf states iraq and syria where the majority are corrupt
3472950 why did such an attack take so long to happen
3472951 it is nothing further than upsetting pakistan why should they india have consulates in jalalabad and khandahar what is their interest there is no interest other than disturbing pakistan doing something about pakistan
3472952 to assume greater responsibility as a stakeholder in the international system commensurate with its growing economic military and soft power
3472953 trilateral consensus between kabul delhi and washington on islamabad alone being the primary and near exclusive troublemaker in afghanistan
3472954 kabul replacing kashmir as the main area of antagonism and as the main area of indo pak antagonism
3472955 indias malicious intentions against pakistan and its efforts that aim to sabotage pakistan afghanistan relations
3472956 are engaged in undermining pakistans security from two fronts they are busy using the baluch card and the pashtun militant card
3472957 india is an eternal enemy of the ummah islamic community and would be confronted after defeating the allied forces stationed in afghanistan

3472965 o blivious to ritters indecisiveness on fulfilling major campaign promises
3472966 it is logically indefensible to simultaneously acknowledge the sanctity of unborn life but refuse to expend political capital in its defense
3472967 abject servitude to political expediency would hardly be lauded as courageous or authentic if it guided policy on civil rights or the environment
3472968 once a politician trades for political gain what he knows to be right on an issue as fundamental as human life its hard to imagine anything he wont compromise

3472980 our lockers are right next to each other im here if he needs me if he has any questions he knows who to ask
3472981 hes been the only guy whos ever thrown the ball to me for eight years
3472982 my main job is to keep his smile on keep him happy
3472983 every now and then you can come to a situation like this and lose your focus bretts handling it well hes starting to have fun out there
3472984 i think the main thing is he finally understands the offense
3472985 hes only been here three days and guys are starting to realize why hes brett favre hes done some good things in three days i told them to just wait until he gets comfortable then theyll see
3472986 hes starting to play around with the defense a little bit everyone wants to pick off bretts ball now hes giving them a couple of different looks theres a pump fake sometimes theres two and then he goes deep on them not many people realize how quick his release is and its starting to show the guy can still play football
3472987 when youve been in only one system from college then you come to a new system its a new system its new people new coaches everything is different
3472988 hes been very good at studying hes been very good at setting an example of how to work at practice
3472989 im one of those guys i believe it when i see it
3472990 we were talking more about how it used to be in green bay
3472991 and how it would be a different adjustment for him coming from a small town green bay to the city new york its quite a change
3472992 he is not i didnt tell him he had to do it by a certain date he acknowledged hes gonna do something and i believe he will do it
3472993 he had to have his loud music in the clubhouse on the days he pitched and i relented on it because none of the players seemed to mind but other guys had their moments too and you have to come up with something to make a statement with otherwise its whatever you want to do and what do you need me around here for
3472994 what am i going to do tell him if you dont do this santa claus isnt coming try to make that one stick
3472995 i think theres a respect for authority there that maybe people dont know is there
3472996 i know its a short sample but certainly hes been very easy for me so far not even low maintenance no maintenance
3472997 this week im telling you there will be some adjustments to his hairdo
3472998 they dont have anything else for him to do so hes sitting in china watching games

3473009 rep allen has shown what can be accomplished through legislation and a personal commitment to policies that benefit working families as our nation wrestles with a host of economic and other issues involving working families rep allen deserves to be congratulated and recognized nationally for his leadership and support

3473015 during my visit i was again impressed with how much home grown energy potential is available in the united states nrel demonstrates on a daily basis that states such as south dakota have the potential to lead the nation in production alternative energy
3473016 nrel is aggressively researching next generation wind turbines which are larger more powerful and more efficient than todays turbines nrel is also experimenting with solar power and developing concepts and solar collectors that could utilize south dakotas abundant sunshine and nrel is perfecting processes that will more efficiently and economically manufacture cellulosic ethanol made from switchgrass wood and corn stover south dakota is or can be a leader in all of these areas of energy production
3473017 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3473018 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3473019 during this summer fire season it is essential to provide our local fire departments with the equipment and training they need to quickly respond to emergencies in their communities
3473020 utahs firefighters provide unparalleled rescue services and i thank them for their courageous work
3473021 with this work complete the entrance to chartiers creek will once again hold overflow and prevent down stream flooding
3473022 over the years the type of design for the flood control and the lack of regular maintenance actually choked off the creek sending more storm water into the downstream towns much of the high water and subsequent damage probably could have been prevented had the original creek not been blocked off
3473023 the army corps of engineers has been great to work with and should be commended they have been very responsive to the local communities and went the extra mile to restore the flood control project this should definitely give comfort to the downstream towns that were submerged by hurricane ivans heavy rains
3473024 we cant stop the rain but this will certainly prevent heavy flooding in the future
3473025 when people pay the same amount of money to receive less service that is a rate hike plain and simple
3473026 the high cost of energy is hurting families small businesses and school districts while placing more hurdles before social service groups who provide an important safety net to those falling behind in a slowing economy
3473027 energy costs are placing burdens on our economy making it more difficult for businesses to expand and raising costs for getting our kids to and from school and providing much needed services for our seniors and most vulnerable citizens
3473028 we cant just focus on one solution we need to focus on all solutions drilling controlling market speculators and investing in renewable energies

3473030 i dont think i have demonstrated my real ability and nor have my team mates but thats normal because we only have one month of preparation
3473031 last season at real madrid i played as a starter in pre season and then i barely got to play again i hope that the contrary happens here but the most important thing is that the team start the season well to get stability
3473032 there are no differences whatsoever when it comes to facilities these are two identical clubs just like when it comes to importance everyday newspapers talk about benfica
3473033 jon voight wrote an op ed for the washington times saying he didnt trust obama on foreign policy issues among other things we talked to jeffrey wells a few days agoand he denied that was a threat but it sure sounded like one joining us from los angeles is jon voight i told mr wells this is exactly the same thing that happened in the 50s when people who were left leaning were called communist and blacklisted from the entertainment industry now what he wrote and what i have heard others say is that conservative actors run the risk of not being hired do you believe that
3473034 well lets hope not bill of course i had many friends among those people who were blacklisted and a very dark time for hollywood i dont think anybody wants to go back to that just you know all i can think of is that this fellow is a little out of line and hopefully he will recover his senses oreilly okay but you know by putting yourself out there as a mccain supporter and criticizing barack obama that this isnt going to play very well in hollywood you are outnumbered about 100 to one out there
3473035 i was doing an interview a couple of days ago and somebody was just very surprised that they had a conservative in hollywood and which is really of course its quite its humorous on the one hand because obviously this is a democracy we require dialogue and interaction and you need to have free speech and competing ideas in order for us to be healthy and grow
3473036 you are a little bit more outspoken it is an emotional situation with barack obama it isnt like kerry or gore its very emotional and thats what i saw from mr wells the hollywood blogger he admitted he got mad that you were criticizing his guy because some people the sensitive community but they have so much emotion tied into barack obama and then in your washington times article you pretty much said hey look i dont believe the guy has got the chops to go up against the terrorists who want to kill us thats not an emotional argument that takes it out of the emotional range
3473037 i may not be smart but i know how to love
3473038 hpc in oil and gas technical directions and operations issues
3473039 its been a long time ever since spring since i took a snap so i just had to get back into the groove of things
3473040 there wasnt too much rust because ive been working everyday trying to get back
3473041 i didnt like the way he practiced today we cant have the ball on the ground
3473042 thats the one thing we all need to learn is to be consistent put the scrimmage behind you come out here the next day and get better in practice and some of us havent quite learned that yet
3473043 were definitely extremely excited about it senator sanders is a huge supporter of the health centers were extremely grateful for that both here and vermont and nationally he has really set an extraordinary bar that has helped bring a lot of new resources to health centers
3473044 given the escalating cost of home heating fuels if we dont dramatically increase funding for the low income home energy assistance program senior citizens on fixed incomes the disabled and low income families with children will go cold this winter
3473045 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3473046 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3473047 samuel etoo will stay with us because thats his wish and my wish
3473048 i know what i said in the first day that i did not count with him as i also said that i would treat him like any other player
3473049 his behaviour in scotland and in the united states has made me decide that he will stay with us and besides he is a player with a lot of talent
3473050 the negotiations to sign a 9 stopped some weeks ago because txiki and myself ordered so
3473051 creative effective designs are one critical one critical way to communicate our messages of social injustice
3473052 its certainly given us more determination to go one step further in all competitions we came so close in everything last year but weve got a new manager and some great signings who i think can strengthen the side and push us on to another level
3473053 what the rest of world does is up to them we need to ensure that modern and civilized values take priority rather than killing and maiming people it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii
3473054 i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii
3473055 wii appeals to a wide range of audiences from children and teenagers to adult and senior citizens anyone from 5 95 as such there is a wide range of content for all ages and tastes available
3473056 mad world will be suitably age rated through the appropriate legal channels and thus only available to an audience above the age rating it is given

3473085 when adequate parking facilities for the accommodation of traffic have been provided and paid for the rates fees and charges shall be adjusted to provide funds for maintenance and operation only
3473086 when i first eyeballed it the obvious reason for it was that there was a need for towns to spend money on parking lots they floated bonds on them there was only one court case and essentially it said that once youve paid them off you can continue to use the money for maintenance and repair and thats it
3473087 i dont know where this law actually plays into us
3473088 i dont have just one account it cuts across every department budget in some way visitor services the department that staffs the lots is one small piece of the big picture we spent two hours here this morning counting the receipts from the weekend for example its all about the parking lots in the summer

3473117 ive been a head coach here for 10 years and havent won a conference championship disappointed yes its either black or white theres really no gray area when you throw things like that on the table if you want to coach until you win a championship youre going to have to answer those kind of questions
3473118 id say based on last year and who we have coming back and based on what everybody else has coming back thats probably about right
3473119 plus the media loves skill guys when youve got the quarterbacks running backs and wideouts thats what the fans and everybody else likes you can see why i think you can definitely see why
3473120 you cant get over the hump until you get close
3473121 and weve surely been the proverbial close but youve got to get your program to where you win a championship and then every other year or three years youre in there playing for it and we just havent done that yet
3473122 theres not a book where you turn to page 13 and it tells you how to get over the hump
3473123 i think the biggest thing i learned from my father is coaching requires patience and perseverance for so many years he was wide right wide right wide left wide right and then he finally hit one i think well do the same i just have to see if i can hold the wolves off until i can finally make a field goal
3473124 if theres pressure you dont want it because youre doing bad
3473125 you want it because youre doing good and they expect you to do better hes worked hard and caught h e l l he deserves a break and i hope he can live up to it and beats everybody but us
3473126 i dont want to sit here and say we dont have quality offensive linemen because we do

3473128 if we dont make it to the acc championship we let some people down
3473129 we let ourselves down all the pieces of the puzzle are there i think this is the first time since ive been here that we really have a legitimate shot of being in the acc championship game

3473152 its with somewhat a heavy heart that i have made the decision to stand down as team manager of hampshire

3473161 whilst everyone at the rose bowl will be very sorry to see paul leave after three decades with hampshire as both player and coach it is our intention to maintain a strong connection with him and his cricket academy in perth

3473207 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban

3473215 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3473216 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3473217 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3473218 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3473221 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3473222 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3473223 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle

3473225 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3473277 todos buscamos la felicidad sin saber que la tenemos que formar y crear todos buscamos amor sin saber que no lo tenenemos que hacer solo sentirlo todos buscamos cambiar a alguien que amamos pero si lo hacemos entonces dejariamos de amarlo porque dejaria de ser la misma persona de quien nos enamoramos al inicio creemos que cambiar es parte de amar pero adaptarse dar y aprender a ceder comprender y respetar es realmente amar admiramos a aquellos que se aman por toda la vida y nunca cambian sus sentimientos pero no entendemos que ellos no se forzan a cambiar se adaptan porque a fin de cuentas cambiar es convertirnos en otra persona y saben que no seria el mismo sentimiento saben prefiero amar toda la vida a la misma persona aunque no la vea porque se que mis sentimientos nunca cambiaran y seran de ella si ella no lo ve no es que no pueda ni quiera simplemente es que tiene miedo ante ello solo nos queda entender y cobijarla con ese amor y hacerlo mas grande para que ella se de cuenta y aprenda a sentirlo se que nunca leeras esta carta pero se que ellos si y entenderan que realmente te amo

3473307 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
3473308 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
3473309 in case youre wondering thats washington speak for it polls well
3473310 if that compels them to drill well get more oil
3473311 if it doesnt the fees will go toward more investment in renewable sources of energy
3473312 what i said was what ive seen so far from a so called gang of 10
3473313 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling positions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful as you might expect from a drilling agenda what i dont want is for the bad to be the enemy of the good
3473314 support a comprehensive energy package which has limited offshore drilling

3473319 gis gives you a very good visualization method to understand what is happening in real time
3473320 gis also provides tools to better analyze large volumes of complex data immediately following the earthquake we worked on a continuous basis with government agencies and others to offer assistance wherever we could we will continue to support the long term recovery the work being done with gis is helping to reduce the impact of this large complex disaster

3473365 alle haben schuld athleten trainer und funktion re es gab aber schon im vorfeld der spiele probleme die zu dem fr hen ausscheiden f hrten der alte bundestrainer dieter grahn besa trotz der erfolge in den letzten jahren keine starke position im deutschen ruderverband und musste nach einem schlechten saisonstart den hut nehmen mit christian viedt wurde ein neuer unerfahrener trainer installiert verband und trainer trafen kurzfristig die entscheidung den achter mit j ngeren ruderern zu besetzen
3473366 es war ein trauriger tag f r den deutschen rudersport meine gef hle sind schwer zu beschreiben ich w re nat rlich gern dabei gewesen durfte aber nicht schadenfreude liegt mir nat rlich fern doch meine kollegen des alten deutschland achters und ich f hlen uns nat rlich schon in unserer meinung best tigt dass der deutsche ruderverband die falsche entscheidung getroffen hat man kann kein komplettes team von heute auf morgen austauschen und dann acht wochen sp ter olympisches gold gewinnen unsere leistungen der letzten zwei jahre wurden seit dem gewinn der weltmeisterschaft komplett unterbewertet
3473367 wir forderten beim verband ein ausscheidungsrennen gegen das neue perspektiv achter team unser argument war wenn die neue mannschaft gewinnt dann sind sie nicht angreifbar sondern konkurrenzf hig sie haben dann einen ma stab weil sie den weltmeister von 2006 geschlagen haben diesen vorschlag lehnte sportdirektor michael m ller ab seine begr ndung der zeitpunkt so kurz vor olympia w re zu kurzfristig ich sage man kann nicht acht individuell starke sportler in ein boot setzen und fertig ist ein sieger team eine mannschaft muss man aufbauen
3473368 im moment des ausscheidens ist man nat rlich sauer und u ert sich oft emotional daf r habe ich verst ndnis wir haben uns damals direkt nach der entscheidung des verbandes erkl rt sp ter aber nicht gest nkert
3473369 f r uns war schon vor olympia klar dass wir nach peking aufh ren werden die teilnahme an den spielen war f r die entscheidung nicht ausschlaggebend den r cktritt haben wir deshalb erst jetzt bekannt gegeben weil wir nicht unn tig unruhe stiften wollten
3473370 meine mitstreiter und ich sind in ein alter gekommen in dem man mit dem rudern aufh ren kann vor allem nach all den erfolgen die wir hatten jan tebr gge hat noch den gro teil der karriere vor sich daf r w nschen wir ihm alles gute es war kein thema f r uns dass er mit aufh ren muss
3473371 im september schlie e ich mein studium der wirtschaftsgeschichte ab
3473372 der posten des sportdirektors michael m ller muss als konsequenz des schlechten sportlichen abschneidens bei den spielen neu besetzt werden auch die verbandsspitze um pr sident siegfried kaidel muss zur cktreten des weiteren sollte der bundestrainer mehr entscheidungsgewalt erhalten zurzeit reden ihm zu viele menschen in seinen job mit denen er sich deshalb immer wieder gut stellen muss das alles w re aber nur der anfang einer langen liste der erneuerung
3473373 ganz klar der deutschland achter ist das f hrungs boot aber deshalb wird nicht die ganze flotte versagen zumal beispielsweise im doppel vierer der m nner und der frauen die vorraussetzung einfach besser sind die ruderer dort haben erfahrung

3473394 the vacillation of data from one month to the next indicates a housing market in transition
3473395 the rise in pending home sales was broad based with all four regions showing gains this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
3473396 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit
3473397 these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
3473398 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices
3473399 in addition rising commodity prices and higher construction costs have resulted in a very unusual market today with existing home prices being less than replacement building costs in some areas
3473400 builders need to further cut production to help trim inventory
3473401 however new home sales are expected to bottom around the second quarter of next year with slight gains in the second half of 2009

3473423 sigue padeciendo la falta de direcci n del consell que cubre los puestos de confianza de la administraci n con el nombramiento de interinos
3473424 muy por debajo de las necesidades de una administraci n moderna a pesar de asumir nuevas competencias y responsabilidades que en muchos caos como es la aplicaci n de la ley de dependencia se hace externalizando el servicio a costa de incrementar su coste
3473425 en personal de confianza de los consellers y en muchos casos forzando la legislaci n al utilizar la cobertura de puestos de confianza mediante nombramientos interinos cuesti n que han venido denunciando reiteradamente los sindicatos de la funci n p blica
3473426 estos puestos de confianza cubiertos mediante nombramientos interinos y no como eventuales evitan que las cifras de puestos de confianza salgan a la luz y parezca que se mantienen pero la realidad es muy diferente y de hecho se ha duplicado el n mero
3473427 no cabe ninguna duda de que este tipo de cobertura ilegal de puestos de confianza acabar con la carrera pol tica de alg n alto cargo cuando las denuncias formuladas por los sindicatos acaben en sentencias ya que esto supone el incumplimiento de la legislaci n y eso en el c digo penal tiene el nombre de prevaricaci n
3473428 adem s mientras sucede esto miles de funcionarios siguen sin cobrar los trienios que les reconoce la legislaci n y se contin a con la pol tica de externalizaciones de servicios algunos incluso con funciones de autoridad que son m s caros y menos eficientes que si lo desarrollan los funcionarios

3473451 government was established by the constitution of 1789 and although initially small in size it was complete and the rules of governance established at the time continue to provide the basis for the organization and management of the executive branch

3473453 the president has executive powers several of which are stated in the constitution implementation of laws for example is principally the responsibility of the president
3473454 the constitution and the intent of the framers was to have a unified executive branch accountable to the president through necessarily hierarchical delegations of authority

3473456 establishes departments and agencies and to whatever degree it chooses the internal organization of agencies personnel systems confirmation of executive officials funding systems and ultimately determines whether the agency shall continue to exist it is congress that establishes all programs and determines whether or not they are being implemented properly
3473457 in the governmental sector the constitutional presumption is that the actions of an agency or officer must have their basis in public law silence in law is prohibition to act

3473656 i do not want to be the one on tv explaining my daughters disappearance
3473657 the statistics show that this is an incredibly rare event and you cant protect people from very rare events it would be like trying to create a shield against being struck by lightning

3473664 residents sometimes joke that if youre already too sick dont go to the hospital because the ride will kill you it suggests a powerlessness among the residents to combat the situation theyve learned to accept it
3473665 some of the women wanted to produce slippers bags and mats but lacked the skills and seed money some women from santa emelia wanted to go into the bakery business to supply their community with fresh bread
3473666 many students complained that they were not learning anything new because of the classroom setup some pupils said they still had difficulty understanding and communicating in english and were not confident of their knowledge of the sciences
3473667 not just classrooms and teachers but upgraded teaching methods books and laboratory facilities
3473668 sometimes the barangay health worker would hide when a patient would come because there was no medicine in the health center they would just tell the resident to plant herbal medicine
3473669 maybe the environment is not a priority because this is something that they see all the time they see that there is still a lot of trees so there is no urgency to look after the environment this is really site specific
3473670 illegal logging is an open secret in the area and if it continues the time will come when the community will see the effects of degradation
3473671 community realities and priorities should be significant considerations in whatever initiatives will be carried out in the land reservation
3473672 the general aim is to improve on your personal best break the philippine record if you can the sea games record and take it from there
3473673 we are looking at launching the products in a selective way initially the product which is scheduled to be launched in the third quarter of the financial year will only be sold to the banks existing clients

3473675 who knows if i can live till then or not
3473676 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3473677 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3473678 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3473679 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3473680 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3473681 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3473682 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws

3473689 a local twelve year old megan was recently put in juvi after denying her friendship with former friend hannah reporter megan has just one thing to say

3473691 one effect of increased entertainmentization of news is that youre always catering to the lowest possible denominator and the largest possible audience with the advent of the remote control it is now possible for a viewer to click through stations very quickly what that new technology has meant is that stations have to very quickly catch an audience as soon as they can because they may only have a few seconds to catch your attention
3473692 you cant develop a very complex or nuanced type of programming when you have to catch a viewer in the few seconds as theyre clicking through the remote control this means that even technological changes have affected content
3473693 limited ownership limits the viewpoints being discussed theres an argument that the views are diverse and you might have representations of different ethnic groups in your programming but the bottomline is everything is geared toward the market so in terms of that youre not going to have any difference of opinion
3473694 theres too many media in too few hands and theres not enough diversity
3473695 its very hard to measure the kind of impact media ownership has on coverage it becomes an issue of what doesnt get covered compared to what does
3473696 for example abc which is owned by disney will sometimes do a feature on theme parks and is presented as a news story when in fact theyre just promoting the theme park of the parent corporation
3473697 it used to be that news was separated from sales and marketing by a firewall it was usually the subsidized and protected gem of the station and the station built its reputation around the quality of its news broadcast that is becoming less and less the case as stations become beholden to shareholders
3473698 there arent a lot of farms in metro manila but one possible reason for his programs popularity is that he isnt using the bombastic style of radio announcing for his show its just normal folks sitting down talking he also says that many of his listeners are from the provinces who want to go home eventually and theyre interested in agricultural type of broadcasting
3473699 if you can just figure who your audience is there are many ways to program that dont necessarily cater to the bottomline
3473700 thats the discussion that really needs to happen there has to be recognition that the airwaves are a scarce resource that needs to be used for the public good
3473701 the general aim is to improve on your personal best break the philippine record if you can the sea games record and take it from there
3473702 we cannot afford to wait three years from today to say were going to double the number of students enrolled in algebra from today
3473703 we cant afford to put together a quick approach or a program on the cheap

3473775 although the declines in notices of defaults seem promising much of this can be explained by the actions of just one lender
3473776 ninety one percent of the decline in notices of default since april can be attributed to countrywide financial unfortunately this is more likely due to the challenges of integrating two companies the size of countrywide financial and bank of america than it is a fundamental shift in foreclosure activity

3473789 its up to us as a group of players to move forward and make sure we are responsible for our actions on the pitch
3473790 its up to the players to show more respect to referees
3473791 i hold my hands up and say that at times i have over stepped the mark but we are here to move forward this is a step in the right direction
3473792 its down to us as a group of players and referees to get a consistent base
3473793 its going to be a continuing relationship with referees we are looking to move it forward and i think we can its down to me to take responsibility for my team mates before they get that booking

3473805 part of life in heavy industry involves a certain dogged persistence in pursuing incremental improvements i contrast that with the silicon valley executives who say you need to have big goals and challenge the organization i dont disagree with that but when you grow up in manufacturing or transportation the incremental improvements you make every day are what create robust change in the end

3473808 all writing involves an athleticism but far from reconciling literature with sports or turning writing into an olympic event this athleticism is excercised in flight and in the break down of the organic body an athlete in bed as michaux put it
3473809 there is no literature without fabulation but as bergson was able to see fabulation the fabulating function does not consist in imagining or projecting an ego rather it attains these visions it raises itself to these becomings and powers
3473810 health as literature as writing consists in inventing a people who are missing it is the task of the fabulating function to invent a people this is the becoming of the writer kafka for central europe and melville for america present literature as the collective enunciation of a minor people or of all minor peoples who find their expression only in and through the writer literature is a delirium but delirium is not a father mother affair there is no delirium that does not pass through peoples races and tribes and does not haunt universal history delirium is a disease the disease par excellence whenever it rects a race it claims is pure and dominant but it is the measure of health when it invokes this oppressed bastard race that ceaselessly stirs beneath dominations resisting everything that crushes and imprisons a race that is outlined in relief in literature as process here again there is always the risk that a diseased state will interrupt the process or becoming health and athleticism both confront the same ambiguity the constant risk that a delirium of domination will be mixed with a bastard delirium pushing literature toward a larval fascism the disease against which it fights even if this means diagnosing the fascism within itself and fighting against itself the ultimate aim of literature is to set free in the delirium this creation of a health or this invention of a people that is a possibility of life to write for this people who are missing for means less in the place of than for the benefit of

3473819 we were not looking ahead i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball

3473827 whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3473828 we gave our best effort if we came up short hes not going to be looked at as a guy who was on a relay that lost or that he came up short nah hes an amazing athlete probably the best ever in this sport regardless of what happens here hes going to go down as that
3473829 i jumped in the air and almost fell in the pool
3473830 i was thinking if there was anybody on this team or in the world who could do it it would be jason who could pull this off i was pounding on the blocks saying aaaaah come on we looked up at the board and it was phenomenal i dont think anybody in the world could have done a better job without a doubt
3473831 we were the favorites in both of those years this year we were actually considered the underdogs in past olympics it just wasnt attainable theres no way i was going to catch a guy whos two seconds ahead of me
3473832 when i flipped at 50 meters and saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder until about two minutes before that the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then i changed i said you know what this is ridiculous its the olympics im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im going to go out in five seconds i was thinking all these things i got supercharged and just took it from there it was unreal

3473901 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3473902 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3473903 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3473904 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3473905 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3473961 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best

3473977 there are a lot of prayers in my line of work i see a lot of hope in the field of oncology i really have a positive outlook i think there is a lot of good stuff coming down the road if you look back just five years we have come a long way in cancer research and treatment but there are still many days i cry with my patients i have to watch some die there is much more good news that i get to share however this is not a job for everybody but the lord leads us each to what we are supposed to be doing i experience hope with the people i work with i get to celebrate with many of my patients
3473978 i went to lipscomb just to transfer some credits when i got here i was taking organic chemistry which is a class most people hate dr langford was an incredible teacher though and i actually liked the class the work really interested me i went home one day and asked my parents if i could transfer to lipscomb permanently it was the first truly adult decision of my life i knew that if i studied at lipscomb i had a great shot at getting into a top medical school and that was my goal
3473979 the move to memphis to work at the west clinic was a good move for me professionally and for my family professionally i get to follow my passions i had been fortunate enough to study under dr robert benjamin a world renowned sarcoma specialist at md anderson cancer center in texas i am able to continue that work here sarcomas are very rare tumors of the bone and muscles they develop more often in children than in adults but i have developed a practice here that works with adult sarcoma patients i am part of mass memphis area sarcoma society it is gratifying to build a program with other professionals in the field
3473980 this part of oncology excites me it is always changing and moving forward i am using my knowledge that i gained at lipscomb from classes such as immunology and cell biology i apply that knowledge in my everyday practice i have carried this knowledge throughout my entire career and built upon it each step of the way in oncology we cant give the latest and greatest care without research being a part of our practice we cant improve treatments and work toward a cure without clinical trials cancer used to be a one hundred percent death sentence now that stat has changed dramatically
3473981 it is very important now that all parties cease fire the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3473982 there then will be international efforts to facilitate the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict we can then look to the issue of how to resolve the longstanding frozen conflicts of south ossetia and abkhazia
3473983 we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3473984 we recognize that there are other avenues for students to report their concerns and we encourage students to speak with adults quan said

3473995 members told us very clearly that the negotiations should not be abandoned too much has been achieved now to simply leave it aside
3473996 we have never been so close to an agreement this is not rhetoric
3473997 this is the truth of where we stand what ministers and senior officials managed to achieve in the week they spent in geneva late july is absolutely remarkable
3473998 among these few remaining issues the most difficult one is the question of the agricultural special safeguard mechanism for developing countries
3473999 there are two diverging views on the so called ssm which proved to be impossible to reconcile during the meeting in july
3474000 one view is that developing countries need to have a safety net against import surges of agricultural products in order to be able to protect their farming systems and that this safeguard should be easy to use
3474001 another view is that like all safeguards in the gatt and wto the ssm should be subject to certain conditions and limitations in order to ensure that that it does not hamper normal trade flows and that it should not be abused
3474002 if i say this it is because i remain convinced that the wtos mandate regarding the gradual removal of obstacles to trade framed with multilateral trading rules constitutes an essential contribution to development and to the improvement of collective well being trade is a development tool a successful conclusion of the doha round by addressing obstacles to trade which today penalise particularly developing countries can be a powerful instrument to fight for development in the hands of countries
3474003 its hard to turn around and say that the hd 4870 x2 is one of the most anticipated cards of recent times due to the plain fact that there have been so many cards released over the last three months while some had thought that the new hd 4870 would become the fastest single card solution on the market the price amd launched the card at gave indication that the chances were going to be pretty slim fast forward a few months and weve got a new card that sits at around the same price of the gtx 280 its packing two hd 4870 cores on a single pcb the same core speed and memory speed as its single card brethren and hopefully a whole bunch of extra performance
3474004 today amd released their new hd 4870 x2 graphics cards
3474005 ati launches their high end single vga card today the hd4870x2 is compared to nvidia top offering in this review using 8 different games to see which ones comes out on top read on to find out
3474006 this should be fairly painless weve already previewed the radeon hd 4870 x2 for you and today that card is becoming official and available for purchase to mark the occasion weve wrangled not one but two of these dual gpu monsters and paired them up via crossfire weve also assembled a killers row of geforce gtx cards for a comprehensive look at the next generation of multi gpu madness can we set a new record for power draw at the wall socket oh i think you know we can
3474007 the radeon hd 4800 series didnt exactly overwhelm nvidias gtx 200 series with raw performance
3474008 yeah weve got you covered at the 300 price point and a new ultra powerful behemoth is coming real soon too maybe you should hold onto your upgrade money for a bit

3474037 meeting the growing demand for row crop supplies for food and energy production is being achieved thanks in part to innovations in plant biotechnology
3474038 according to usdas report issued today soybean production is forecast at 2 97 billion bushels up 15 percent from last year corn yields are expected to average 155 bushels per acre up 3 9 bushels from last year if realized this would be the second highest corn yield on record behind 2004
3474039 plant biotechnology helps contribute to crop yield increases allowing farmers to meet the growing demand for food feed and fuel currently 91 percent of soybeans and 73 percent of corn grown in the united states are biotech varieties which enable these plants to resist insect and weed threats
3474040 in the very near future biotechnology will allow crops to survive in drought and other adverse growing conditions these breakthroughs will not only help american farmers but farmers around the world

3474046 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3474047 georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3474048 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the us and europe
3474049 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3474050 i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and trans atlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship
3474051 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values

3474053 look i know youre here and youre gonna catch a beating for it
3474054 why dont you work at different clubs on different nights
3474055 youre alex that doorguy for that club in the meatpacking
3474056 oh you have to let this guy in hes a super vip
3474057 i respect you and i respect armin but you guys do a thankless job if you let someone in nine times you may never thank you but if you dont let that person in one time its like youre such an asshole its just thankless but you have to deal with it
3474058 we were about 75 percent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes
3474059 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3474060 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3474061 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3474062 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3474063 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organisers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3474064 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3474065 des manifestants handicap s jet s terre par la police
3474066 youre going out of business but you dont know it your margin is gone ghost
3474067 the people you think control the game are about to lose it anyway
3474068 attitudes and expectations of the public in part determine the degree to which children adolescents and adults with intellectual disabilities are able to learn work and live alongside their peers without disabilities
3474069 ports are bad ships rot and men go to the devil
3474070 edwards claims it was a brief liaison but thats not how a friend of rielle hunters remembers it
3474071 shes been portrayed as this fatal attraction like woman who was semi stalking him madly in love delusional talking bad about his wife the woman that you claim to know for 20 years does that ring true
3474072 this woman in question has a very interesting history knowing her as this kind of bar fly who had this kind of crazy past from reading everything i read it seemed to me that she targeted edwards
3474073 your impressions of this woman rielle hunter whos being trashed in new york papers today on the cover of this one it says rielle cruel saying that she trashed elizabeth edwards said she was a woman who had bad karma what can you tell us about her
3474074 so for her this was about love not sex did she describe this as hot and heavy frequent visits intense passionate
3474075 yes yes and intense intellectually as well shes a very keenly intellectually engaged woman shes very insistent upon rigorous dialogue and shes very interested in what makes people tick so they wouldve connected and they do connect on that level as well as human beings and as souls they connected very deeply on that level
3474076 did she describe it as im so excited to kick off this affair with this married man or was she ever battling her conscience like i met this great guy but hes married
3474077 i wonder if there was something about his wifes illness that somehow got him to cheat or contributed at least i think that we get so caught up in good or bad you know is somebody a good person or a bad person cheating is wrong
3474078 do you think that john edwards is the father of her daughter
3474079 i do i dont see any other explanation she would not have a child with someone that she didnt love and she loves him
3474080 speaking with susana in her home andrea recounteed how she had spent eight years in a living hell of psychological and physical abuse she was forced to take drugs and was beaten severely to break her will she saw pregnant girls undergoing forced abortion with a coat hanger once andrea witnessed the owner of a prostitution house kill a girl by breaking her neck
3474081 the four leaders are working with their local business partners in markets around the world to build and distribute a pre loaded pc offering that features ibms open collaboration client solution occs including lotus notes lotus symphony and lotus sametime the linux operating system of each distributor and software applications and installation services from the local partners in each market
3474082 how come sun and openoffice org arent directly involved in this microsoft free pc effort is openoffice org assisting the effort at all
3474083 well yes theyre all using our software the openoffice org community maintains the openoffice org software assisted by generous sponsorship from sun ibm novell redflag red hat etc several of these companies then use the software as a base for their own products suns staroffice ibms symphony redflags redoffice canonical red hat and novell will now have distributions both with openoffice org and with ibms symphony that provides choice to their customers as they can choose which flavour of software suits them best the really good news is that both software packages use the iso approved opendocument format to store their documents so people can happily swap backwards and forwards between openoffice org and symphony without losing any data formatting etc the significant difference between openoffice org and ms office is microsofts marketing budget ibm also have considerable marketing budgets so hopefully this will help to redress the balance

3474093 al fin y al cabo mi trabajo es sacar rendimiento de la gente que ponen a mi disposici n y durante estas semanas que llevamos juntos estoy encantado con su comportamiento
3474094 es bien sabido que el caso de ronaldinho deco y etoo no eran razones futbol sticas
3474095 yo s de samuel lo que he visto yo no hablo de lo que pas en el pasado porque no estaba yo a etoo lo conozco de estas tres semanas y s lo tengo palabras de entusiasmo por su comportamiento
3474096 por el bien de todos la gente estar encantada no s lo con samuel si no con el juego del equipo
3474097 que sea el mismo no se puede vivir once meses en un vestuario siendo uno que no se es tiene cosas malas como todos tenemos como s lo puedo hablar de lo que he visto y estoy encantado con l

3474111 and he is screaming and it is upsetting the patients
3474112 america has the second highest business tax rate in the entire world
3474113 is it any wonder that jobs are moving overseas were taxing them out of the country
3474114 but the gao study confirms what we already knew whatever the nominal tax rate us corporations pay an effective rate among the lowest in the industrial world
3474115 fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 pm and 11 39 pm on friday which prevented a rain belt from moving toward the stadium
3474116 why dont we have the power to stop more unsavory things lingering in the air stop things from from pouring down on the people
3474117 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3474118 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3474119 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3474120 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3474121 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3474122 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3474123 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3474124 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3474125 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3474126 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3474127 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects
3474128 in two of the films hughes picked a tune that had tenderness in the title try a little tenderness otis redding singing with jon cryer lip synching a classic scene
3474129 one of the things i learned re watching these films is that hughes puts in a scene completely untouched that even lacks a lot of the flash of the rest of the movie that says this is the point of the film here it is
3474130 so try a little tenderness is absolutely what its all about
3474131 there is neither jew nor greek slave nor free male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus
3474132 we are all a brain an athlete a basket case a princess and a criminal
3474133 duckie is a lot like a lot of us and i think thats why a lot of us like him
3474134 were all able to say it its supposed to be about tenderness the world should be kind this should be loving i have a great friend and im in love with her and this should be working why isnt it working and so we rant and we push and eventually we come around if were kind thats the thing if were tender with ourselves eventually well come around he has to learn that lesson
3474135 theyre searching and theyre seeking i think he understood that about kids that theyre not devoid of a spiritual existence they just dont engage in the religious institutions theyre doing it all outside of them these kids are unmoored theyre rootless its interesting
3474136 the congregation really wants me to try it with my cousin vinny
3474137 the joke at church yesterday was that the next series should be all fellini films wow ok maybe well do that in lent
3474138 a lot of us believe that the best church can do is reinterpret using pop culture tools to make its own art
3474139 i think people really need to have god pointed out where they live they need encouragement to see it because they want to
3474140 im a lumberjack i work all day cut down trees and wear high heals
3474141 were not trying to put on a show were trying to play the game the way we know how to play
3474142 usa softball plays the game hard plays the game aggressively playing it smart and thats my concern
3474143 if it was a great show i hope we have more great shows throughout the week
3474144 yes if i dont know their name ill call them sir not all the time just sometimes

3474158 o fundamentalismo interpreta e aplica literalmente os textos religiosos n o sabe que a linguagem simb lica da b blia rica em met foras recorre a lendas e mitos para traduzir o ensinamento religioso

3474165 could europe be involved in a peacekeeping mission europe is available to do that of course
3474166 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3474167 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3474168 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3474169 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make
3474170 neither the u s nor any other foreign country is physically in place
3474171 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3474172 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3474173 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3474174 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3474175 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3474176 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3474177 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3474178 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3474179 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3474180 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3474181 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3474182 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3474183 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3474184 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3474185 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3474186 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3474187 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3474188 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3474189 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3474190 the words found in the towns charter their arrangement for the purpose of expressing the difference between the classes of town and regional elective offices and the use of repetition and amplification to express the definition of elective town offices plainly expresses what town elected offices are included in section 3 2
3474191 w e did not want people who were already elected to other positions in our local government serving on the charter commission
3474192 this lone memory fails to find support in the published preexisting documentary evidence on the 1989 charter commissions deliberations and recommendations
3474193 coverage for their role in breaking shaping and spinning news stories
3474194 our mandate here is to acquire iconic consumer product names that are underperforming or undervalued
3474195 things really started cooking last fall and over the last six months theres been an increase in the amount of opportunities for us ive got meetings every day
3474196 we have a whole team out there looking to acquire and gain access to what we see as brands where we can make a difference
3474197 there is an opportunity if you have a very long term viewpoint to pick up some strong well recognized names and turn them around but its not something thats going to happen in a very short time period and the stock market is nothing if not impatient
3474198 sorry to keep you in the dark but theres something big coming soon
3474199 we worked immediately to communicate with the customers as soon as we acquired the company
3474200 we wanted to make sure people werent left wondering what was going on
3474201 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3474202 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3474203 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3474204 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3474205 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3474206 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3474207 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3474208 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3474209 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humor they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3474210 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3474211 i think its important to show what kids really use
3474212 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3474213 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3474214 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3474215 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3474216 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3474217 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3474218 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3474219 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
3474220 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3474221 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3474222 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3474223 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3474224 your fathers dead he was shot this morning not far from the house im sorry
3474225 suddenly for a minute i felt like everyone needed to take a knee and listen to what i had to say because i f kin made it and my way works and all this stuff
3474226 well hes hot amp 2 there but for the grace were all one drink away from that
3474227 awright girls lets take a knee and um remembering were not allowed to pray in school think about playing real good today
3474228 and although in the picture above he couldnt possibly look more like wayne newton
3474229 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3474230 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3474231 in settings with a large proportion of psa detected tumors the relative reduction in risk of death following radical prostatectomy removal of the gland might be somewhat larger or similar to that in our study but the absolute reduction would be smaller
3474232 unclear how these results apply to the patients we are taking care of today they show how many questions remain unanswered
3474233 basically i dont think we know the right answer about what to do
3474234 more men die with their prostate cancer than of it
3474235 i have discussions with a patient about his other medical conditions his age his willingness to receive treatment that may have long term side effects weighed against the risk that he may develop an aggressive cancer
3474236 does provide evidence that intervention in the form of surgery does have a curative effect for some men the question is which men
3474237 with screening you catch a lot of different types of cancer and also at different ages there is no information in the study on the age of detection
3474238 the big benefit of treating potentially lethal prostate cancer comes early in the first five to 10 years
3474239 showed lots of benefits of surgery but did not find any benefit from surgery for men over the age of 65
3474240 my experiences fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want
3474241 there is something about a lot of the people in power that they think the rules no longer apply to them or theyre above the rules
3474242 they have a sense of entitlement that comes with their prestige or place in the political sphere
3474243 google makes it easy to opt out of the doubleclick tracking cookie

3474254 i would definitely say that people arent as excited about going to minneapolis as they were about going to new york city
3474255 minneapolis is a nice city but it doesnt quite have the environment and reputation of a new york city and i think 2004 was a unique convention and a lot of it had to do with where it was
3474256 probably be two to three years to get some oil
3474257 barbarians look this is georgian democracy if it werent for russia we would already have been buried here

3474259 we hadnt realised quite how much the show means to people
3474260 there is such a phenomenal amount of goodwill out there from exhibitors suppliers and spectators that we owe it to them to try and continue
3474261 our volunteers will need to work incredibly hard but if the support shown to us can translate into fundraising and sponsorship the trawden agricultural show will be back next year
3474262 they threatened me saying you are not allowed to go
3474263 we have not had any contact with hua huiqi hence the situation that he has been detained does not exist
3474264 opinions are divided over how china will do in individual events but it seems almost everyone expects at least 40 golds which is very optimistic
3474265 and saw three letters a k a g and a b
3474266 it hurts because it has encouraged georgia to try to push maximalist positions weve got to get this territory back at all costs and if we get it back the united states will support us
3474267 as if the pro withdrawal times would be cheerleading such an aggressive move by bush if it did take place
3474268 you said that the soviets were an evil empire but its you that are the empire
3474269 oh fairs drop a note card to shadowiccan and his partner wiccan sojourner at bewitched you should have the landmark

3474272 last week i copped a bit of flack over my
3474273 number one with a bullet is one that most of you never think of but trust me the pc vendors and developers are painfully aware that
3474274 perhaps the most interesting part of the new gos is that the distro has adopted the newer lightweight lxde which stands for 20 most nimble and simple x window managers for linux
3474275 one of the best ways to speed up your linux desktop is to utilize an ultra lightweight window manager
3474276 im getting way behind on these things so im combining the rants and laughs posts into one series i can feel that were industry study says recording industry should embrace piracy
3474277 considering the success of ubuntu linux as a distribution of the open source operating system it has become clear that locating good alternatives to this release is becoming increasingly difficult
3474278 no piece of software is immune to defects which is why its important to use tools that help find and fix bugs thats the idea with how to install ubuntu linux in 12 easy steps
3474279 canonicals ubuntu desktop linux distribution is one of the more popular versions of the open source operating system and its linux rises to top dog in servers

3474283 as companies work through a shaky market and new legislation theyre scaling back notably on direct marketing many seem to be waiting for winds of change before they send more offers
3474284 the second quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of home value declines and we see little promise of turnaround in the short term as the rates of decline have yet to slow and in fact actually accelerated in many markets
3474285 the high rates of negative equity are having a direct effect on home sales figures as weve seen considerable growth in foreclosure transactions and homes selling for a loss

3474478 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3474479 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3474480 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3474481 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3474482 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3474483 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3474484 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3474485 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3474486 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

3474492 we see the ftc as absolutely critical but the states should be partners in this as well
3474493 if we had all hands on deck we could really make some progress in addressing this problem
3474494 there must be a recognition that online fraud is a huge threat to consumers as well as a threat to online commerce
3474495 does not have a relationship with knoa in addition hp and knoa are not engaged in any joint projects as indicated by the knoa spokesperson in the article
3474496 they mobilize themselves without a need for a central location to do so distribute the targets discuss the attack approaches come up with a plan on the coordination and you have everyone participating
3474497 a bunch of youth groups posted something that was almost a manifesto that called on supporter to wage an information war against georgia
3474498 in the ongoing russian versus georgia cyberwar we have an indication of lists of georgian governmental sites actively distributed across russian web forums
3474499 by posting on blogs and forums instructions that essentially say this is what were going to do but we dont know whos behind that
3474500 georgian hackers or pro georgian hackers launched distributed denial of service attacks against ria novosti
3474501 especially in russia every time something happens there are attacks name any crisis there in the past year and i can point to a spike in attack traffic
3474502 countries visionary enough in the long term sort of tolerate hacking activities unless of course they target the countrys infrastructure in order for the country to later on mobilize them based on nationalist sentiments
3474503 what the attackers learned is that security researchers are actively monitoring their conversations and so in the russo georgia campaign the conversation wasnt happening at the usual underground corners but rather on mainstream forums
3474504 theyve also learned how to better utilize the masses to participate in the attack and that combination of tactics would improve the quality of the campaign
3474505 anyone picking a political fight with russia today can now expect to deal with multiple forms and sources of electronic attack not only from the russian military but also from the russian governments unofficial civilian hacker assets
3474506 a cyberwarfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian web sites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs
3474507 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
3474508 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
3474509 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
3474510 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
3474511 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3474512 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3474513 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3474514 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3474515 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3474516 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political

3474523 some of the spirit of self negation self discipline sense of humour responsibility helpfulness to others loyalty and patriotism which go to make character
3474524 the reason we find the concept of character difficult is because of class conflict in british society
3474525 there was a sense that good character was handed down from a patrician class to the great unwashed
3474526 a refusal to make judgments about what is good and bad behaviour right and wrong
3474527 a young student ponders whether to spend the evening revising at her desk or to go out with friends better marks mean better prospects but dancing and drink are attractive too how much to sacrifice tonight for a remote future when to stop having fun but also when to stop being serious conventions expectations and institutions have built up gradually over decades and centuries to form a stock of equipment available to deal with her problem sources and strategies of self control both cognitive and social take time to develop
3474528 over time poverty has become more associated with differences in character development
3474529 so while in the past a poor deprived child would have about the same chance of developing a good character as a more affluent one our research suggests that children who were born into deprivation in the 1970s as opposed to the late 1950s were much less likely to develop good character than more affluent groups
3474530 theres an interaction between your genetic predisposition and the way you turn out according to the way youre raised
3474531 when it comes to being antisocial aggressive stealing and lying the interaction is a big one if you have poor self control and a rather twitchy irritable temperament and youre brought up in a harsh way its bad news for that group the rate of criminality aged 17 is about 40 per cent but if you have that twitchy character and youre brought up in a reasonably calm soothing way your parents dont overreact they let you run around in the park after school you will do well
3474532 financial poverty is a factor but not a central one
3474533 i am fond of saying poverty of what and actually it seems to be poverty of the parent child experience that leads to poor child outcomes rather than poverty of a material kind
3474534 the danger is that many people in deprived areas are being denied work because of a lack of cultural capital
3474535 in glasgow 50 per cent of jobs are now filled by commuters from the middle class suburbs
3474536 one of the key things about a family that works well is the in built hierarchy
3474537 the ideal sort of family for character development is two adult parents and older siblings who are well behaved then there are opportunities for purposeful activities a family holiday with joint activities or regularly playing football in the park family mealtimes and having meaningful conversations with parents are particularly important
3474538 it is regular time with the same adult over an extended period so that you respect them and learn from them
3474539 which is why things like the scout movement are so effective because youre progressing youre ageing through the institution and there tends to be a very good staying on rate for the adult workers so you have a lot of interaction with the same adult over a long period of time
3474540 the latest developments in basic neuroscience and pre clinical research are rapidly bringing us closer to important and practical applications
3474541 once more we are proud to bring this important event to the worldwide community of researchers as we continue addfs mission to accelerate the discovery of novel disease modifying treatments for alzheimers disease
3474542 calling on moscow to sign on to the outlines of a cease fire as the georgian government has done
3474543 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3474544 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3474545 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3474546 so invading a neighboring sovereign state is unacceptable in the 21st century but invading a sovereign state in another continent is fine and dandy or does it become okay to invade sovereign states if you invade two of them rather than only one what am i missing here bush is promoted to supreme galactic emperor of hypocrisy with oak leaves
3474547 oh and if russia is to be true to its word how about georgia being true to its word and not claiming to have entered upon a ceasefire while continuing to kill civilians in south ossetia
3474548 the sad thing epppie is that a lot of people will be believing these busheviks without question
3474549 despite the tough talk in washington there was no specific threat of any consequences russia might face if it ignores the warnings american officials said they were working with u s allies in europe and elsewhere as well as with the russians to defuse the crisis
3474550 the sad thing epppie is that a lot of people will be believing these busheviks without question yeah as for my questions i guess john yoo would come up with some convoluted answer that defied all rules of logic
3474551 earlier monday the united states and the worlds six other largest economic powers issued a call similar to bushs for russia to accept a truce and agree to mediation as conditions deteriorated and russian troops continued their advances into georgian territory
3474552 ecretary of state condoleezza rice and her colleagues from the group of seven leading industrialized nations pledged their support for a negotiated solution to the conflict that has been raging since friday the state department said
3474553 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3474554 russia was the first to call for an renunciation of violence and it did it in the un not on tv
3474555 a senior u s diplomat matthew bryza is now in tbilisi and is working with georgian and european officials there on ways to calm the situation
3474556 the pentagon said it had finished flying some 2 000 georgian troops back home from iraq on c 17 aircraft at georgias request
3474557 defense department spokesman bryan whitman said the u s flew the georgians out of iraq as part of a prior agreement that transport would be provided in case of an emergency
3474558 pentagon officials said monday that u s military was assessing the fighting every day to determine whether less than 100 u s trainers should be pulled out of the country
3474559 there had been about 130 trainers including a few dozen civilian contractors but the civilians had been scheduled to rotate out of the country and did so over the weekend whitman said
3474560 and if you were russia how would you feel about calls for peace coming from the country that trained your enemy to attack you
3474561 putin is a very intelligent and wellspoken guy too bad hes a would be dictator but theres something refreshing about a would be dictator who is intelligent vs one who seems to be dumber than a board

3474569 our tv program production and broadcasting capabilities need to evolve as our network expands so we strive to embrace new technologies that can help advance our services
3474570 we work with companies such as proxim wireless and smartway digital to ensure that we continue to deliver state of the art multimedia solutions to our audience and provide superior real time information broadcasting
3474571 this deployment was especially challenging because we needed to integrate different kinds of wireless networks as well as av compression with wimax
3474572 proxims end to end wireless product portfolio is ideal for such a deployment since the equipment provides end to end qos which is critical for voice and video and enables us to customize a network to meet the precise wireless needs of our customers with the confidence that the equipment will interact well throughout the network
3474573 proxim has a long history as an innovator in the wireless broadband market and was an early proponent of wimax technology this deployment illustrates the benefits of proxims end to end solution by providing a more cost effective and higher capacity solution than the previous satellite based system enabling the delivery of wireless iptv to more people

3474649 equine encephalomyelitis and west nile virus infection are easily preventable
3474650 the vaccines are effective and you should be vaccinating your animals every year preferably in the spring before the first mosquito hatch
3474651 even in areas where we dont normally have a lot of mosquitoes theres been a bumper crop this year we know that west nile virus is going to show up every summer and now we know we have mosquitoes carrying the eee virus mosquitoes stick around until the first killing frost so we could have months ahead of us when theres a risk of mosquito borne illness if you havent vaccinated your horses for both eee and wnv do it now if youve already vaccinated them consult your veterinarian about boosters
3474652 we always recommend that veterinarians administer vaccinations and get a look at the animal to check for clinical signs especially this late in the season when most mosquito borne infections could already be present

3474665 even with the industrys increased computerization health insurance companies are still buried under mountains of paper based claims that require significant labor to sort review and process the result is claims backlogs and decreased visibility into claims inventories that can jeopardize an insurers cash flow and profitability
3474666 administeps digital mailroom services are more than just an outsourced labor solution because we convert paper based claims into digital formats and verify them for accuracy insurers then use administep to manage the claims apply business rules and increase efficiency all in real time
3474667 the real benefit of combining our digital mailroom service with administep is that it gives payors greater control over the handing of errors its what we call exception management when there is an incomplete or illegible claim or when a claim contains an error it is automatically routed to the appropriate person to resolve the issue in the most cost effective manner
3474668 this claims triaging resolves errors quickly so clean claims are sent for processing which reduces the demands placed on the claim adjudication system

3474703 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3474704 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3474705 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3474706 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3474707 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3474708 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3474709 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change

3474950 i am taking it seriously but its really hard to think about leaving
3474951 the only thing that would make me do it is the uncertainty we just dont know whats going to happen with ford
3474952 we need to restructure and its important to our business to do so
3474953 but we want to do it in the best way for our employees
3474954 these companies are trying to do in the last 24 months what they should have done over the last 24 years
3474955 we always prefer for people to voluntarily leave and thats why we put the energy and effort into this package of buyouts
3474956 because of the loss of market share and because the economy is so bad there arent enough jobs for everybody
3474957 its the reality of the business whether you like it or not
3474958 we never had this type of opportunity when i was in the steel industry
3474959 we knew for years that the industry was in trouble and one day the doors just shut
3474960 ive heard of offering out placement assistance but this is unique
3474961 i went from making cars to making pizzas and its turned out pretty well for me
3474962 i also know some people who took the money and spent it and now theyre struggling
3474963 ive been here 12 years and i cant believe i lasted this long
3474964 id like to retire but its just not enough money for me now
3474965 im making almost 000 a year and i cant see leaving that behind
3474966 todd bentley the evangelist who has led the florida outpouring revival here in lakeland since april 2 has filed for separation from his wife and might not return to the revival according to his former local spokesperson lynne breidenbach
3474967 it is with considerable sadness then that we must temper the jubilation we know you all feel with the sobering news that todd and shonnah bentley are presently experiencing significant friction in their relationship and are currently separated
3474968 the frustration of good providers has reached a boiling point
3474969 we have to help shape a better system of consumer protection for residents
3474970 among societys marginalized people the most vulnerable and excluded are those living with disabilities
3474971 we are all susceptible to experiencing a disability f or the average african disability is a daily observation as major african countries and cities are saturated with beggars who have obvious forms of disability
3474972 the exodus guild inc was established to facilitate the inclusion and social welfare of the worlds largest minority group into the public and private domain of public health and education
3474973 in addition to the fundamental challenges faced by exodus such as limited resources the stigma that is inherent to disability remains one of the biggest challenges we face
3474974 public sentiment assumes that having a disability suggests an inability to perform
3474975 deserve a life of dignity and not one of isolation remains a daunting task especially in the african community
3474976 to see society operate with a focus on making lives better
3474977 was i ever crazy maybe or maybe life is crazy isnt being broken or swallowing a dark secret its you or me amplified if you ever told a lie and enjoyed it if you ever wished you could be a child forever

3474986 my inference is that they concluded that this administration would not release hamdan at the end of his sentence but the next one might
3474987 i think hamdans continued detention past the end of his sentence although justifiable under the law of war would be a political train wreck and i think the panel made an effort to protect the u s from further international criticism
3474988 for seven years uniformed military officers have pushed back against the administrations most extreme and unlawful detention and interrogation policies only to be overruled by white house lawyers with little respect for the constitution or geneva conventions
3474989 we may never know what the commission members were thinking but we saw what they did they ensured that mr hamdans fate will be determined by a future administration with more respect for the rule of law
3474990 holding hamdan past the end of his term is only going to further inflame anti american feelings in the muslim world where the u s will clearly be perceived as continuing to discriminate on the basis of nationality or religion
3474991 todays teenagers deserve a lot of credit theyre socially aware theyre environmentally conscious theyre smart
3474992 operational issues at our dikulushi and mutoshi mines have adversely impacted second quarter financial performance
3474993 positive sentiment seen at the end of the first quarter that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived
3474994 in the second half of this year ubs does not expect to see any improvement in the adverse economic and financial market trends that affected this quarters results
3474995 the good news in these results is the break up of the group into three autonomous units because this allows for an eventual sale or part sale of the investment bank
3474996 we think we have reached the trough of the wave on the net new money outflow that would take time to come back to a more normal level
3474997 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3474998 others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity
3474999 in light of the exceptionally strong prices bonterra is receiving for production coupled with the reduction in the payout ratio management and the board of directors have reassessed the hedging policy and decided that in the near term the trust will not enter into further risk management strategies
3475000 the results for the second quarter of 2008 included certain non recurring costs related to the transition and integration of recently acquired collicutt energy services ltd and restructuring costs in connection with the business support integration in the u k

3475002 she is attending and there was some sort of clerical error in which somebody said she was hosting but she is not
3475003 why did she allow barack obama to quietly list her as co host of a washington fundraiser at a tony restaurant in august because she thought louisianans might not notice
3475004 senators especially those running for re election dont get listed as fundraising co hosts for presidential candidates by accident
3475005 i can assure you that it had nothing to do with a kennedy e mail about it
3475006 they were retreating it wasnt panic but they were trying to leave one by one not in groups
3475007 we dont have anything we dont have food we left when the shelling started with very few things
3475008 we dont know whats going on and why the russians did this to us they said they were defending ossetians who are they defending here
3475009 if the russians say theyre defending the civilian population why dont they care about kodori gorge
3475010 they dont know where theyll go we have no idea theres so much confusion
3475011 youre going to see more brown faces youre going to see more filipino faces in the media and all over entertainment this is just the beginning get ready for it
3475012 if you see all the teams theres at least one filipino on every team and on a lot of teams the majority of them are filipino its about time were getting up there especially in the dancing scene
3475013 a lot of people think that texas is cowboys and indians and that we ride on horses but theres a lot of filipinos in houston
3475014 were always going to remember this for the rest of our lives
3475015 when we wake up we practice we use the bathroom we sleep and it repeats over and over again

3475021 beer is an alcoholic beverage produced by brewing and the fermentation of starches derived from cereals the most common cereal for beer brewing is malted barley although wheat corn and rice are also widely used usually in conjunction with barley most beer is flavoured with hops which adds a slightly bitter taste and acts as a natural preservative occasionally other ingredients such as herbs or fruit may also be included in the brewing process alcoholic beverages fermented from non starch sources such as grape juice wine or honey mead are not classified as beer
3475022 as almost any substance containing carbohydrates mainly sugar or starch can naturally undergo fermentation it is likely that beer like beverages were independently invented among various cultures throughout the world the invention of bread and beer has been argued to be responsible for humanitys ability to develop technology and build civilization
3475023 in 1506 beer was given a makeover when the german purity law made it mandatory for beer to only have four ingredients water barley wheat and hops
3475024 barley is a key ingredient that adds a certain amount of color and flavor depending on the roasting time barley is responsible for the sweet taste in beers
3475025 hops come in several different varieties the type used as well as the length of time its included in the brewing process affect the bitterness aroma and flavor of the beer hops are called the spice of beer
3475026 water may be flavorless but this main ingredients chemical components often affect the final flavor of the beer hard water produces bitter ale while softer water produces a bitter lager
3475027 yeast comes in various strains and affects the flavor and aroma this ingredient converts the sugar in the malt into alcohol
3475028 a variety of beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names

3475044 oil futures were lower on tuesday extending last nights losses under pressure from the stronger dollar and as news emerged that russia was halting its military operation against georgian troops in a conflict surrounding the breakaway region of south ossetia
3475045 geopolitical concerns always provide good support to oil prices and this news should offer some relief to investors worried about exports of azeri crude from ports in georgia
3475046 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi
3475047 we dont know yet whether it was damaged its a second attempt to bomb this pipeline since august 10
3475048 the strong recovery in the dollar adds more pressure to the sector which is already suffering from fears over slowing global growth
3475049 at the same time it emerged today that the iea has raised its demand forecast for 2009 by 70 000 barrels to 87 8 million barrels per day

3475052 weve just initiated a process to go out and respond to people who have proactively approached us over the last couple years as theyve became familiar with this opportunity
3475053 now that weve finalized the engineering study weve decided to go out to them and solicit proposals
3475054 so we would own a smaller share of a larger facility which we think would be a much better value opportunity for shareholders
3475055 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration
3475056 we believe ubs investment bank will be not fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3475057 will move back into the tax paid market recognizing the fairly significant selling price difference between our lowest tax paid offering and what we believe people are paying for the untaxed
3475058 even prior to the growth of the contraband market in the last few years we had seen declines in the tax paid market as the number of smokers and the average claim consumption declined
3475059 we had a huge drop in the commodities yesterday so were having a slight rebound
3475060 the results were not great the market was pricing in half decent figures and thats what it got
3475061 in the real world its a good set of numbers a decent earnings beat and 7 percent underlying organic growth on the top line
3475062 however in light of the share price movement going into the results the in line underlying performance and unchanged guidance signify no incremental positives
3475063 nobodys feeling were out of the woods here but theres a distinctively more positive tone
3475064 we believe this slowdown will accelerate throughout 2008 given the lag factor between revenues and investment banking job cuts and that markets will see very limited growth by q4

3475078 we fought for two and a half years for just the right to go and see prisoners and then fought for months more to get security clearance so that the military would let you in there this is bizarre it never occurred to me when i went to law school in america that we would be seating around talking about whether we would have access to our clients whether our clients were being tortured as a prisoner in guantanamo you have no rights you have no right to a lawyer you have no meaningful right to witnesses you dont know what the charges are you certainly dont know what the secret evidence is when my clients are found not guilty at the csrt tribunal and then the military things that they were being called nec not enemy combatants but now they are called nlec no longer enemy combatants because we military interrogators want to say they were guilty to begin with but now they have had a change of hearts they are not guilty anymore but we were right in the first place

3475104 the only time you ever have in which to learn anything or see anything or feel anything or express any feeling or emotion or respond to an event or grow or heal is this moment because this is the only moment any of us ever gets

3475145 the trend isnt necessarily done here in terms of weaker currencies versus the u s dollar but it is looking fairly stretched in the short term and i think a modest recovery looks a little bit overdue

3475434 the most fundamental right within the western liberal tradition is the right of individuals to be left alone in the enjoyment of life liberty and justly acquired property the most fundamental obligation is to leave others alone in their enjoyment of the same
3475435 the sole function of a bill of rights is to protect this fundamental right from violation by the state which in every time and place has been the foremost threat to life liberty and property
3475436 some bills of rights have been more technically comprehensive than others some have been more effective than others but historically it has been fear of the state that has lain behind calls for any bill of rights
3475437 the effect and probably the intention of this proposed bill of rights is to weaken protection of genuine rights by the enumeration of non rights
3475438 it may be politically expedient in some times and places for the tax payers to be forced to subsidise the education and healthcare and general support of the poor
3475439 and the right to a healthy environment is an expectation that legitimises wholesale violations of life liberty and property
3475440 nothing in the news reports we have seen suggests that this proposed new bill of rights will contain prohibitions of racial religious or sexual
3475441 nor is anything said about the supposed need to balance rights against responsibilities
3475442 has been in practice a means of limiting the exercise of rights in any way found inconvenient by the state it has never so far had any place in english law the proper place for setting out the details of our obligation to leave others alone is the civil and criminal law
3475443 the human rights act 1998 is imperfect in its protection of rights even so it is a document that recognises the rights of the western liberal tradition until it can be replaced by a more perfectly liberal document it should be left in place if any change is required it should only be to give the courts power to strike down any subsequent law explicitly as well as reducing its protections
3475444 it is vain to do with more than can be done with less
3475445 why you shouldnt storm out before getting all the details

3475510 by offering stop start on a wider range of models at higher volumes oems are able to reduce fuel consumption and harmful emissions much faster and at lower cost than by deploying mild and full hybrid powertrains on niche models these recent announcements represent a path forward for other car makers consumers who are taking advantage of lower taxation charged against low emitting models or have recently been hit hard by fuel price rises are now more aware of the value of stop start

3475515 current expectations are for the global and u s economic environments to continue to be weak for capital markets to remain under stress and for a continued decline in u s housing prices
3475516 given the potential stress on the consumer from the continued downward pressure on housing prices and the elevated national inventory of unsold homes management remains extremely cautious with respect to the home equity mortgage and credit card portfolios
3475517 as described below management expects continued deterioration in credit trends for the consumer portfolios which will likely require additions to the consumer loan loss allowance during the remainder of 2008
3475518 while the second quarter cannot be called a good quarter by any stretch it is a better quarter than investors had expected
3475519 the general feeling as banks entered this earnings season was that there would be overly large write downs dividend cuts and large capital raises at very dilutive prices
3475520 what theyre indicating is that in the third quarter prices in the markets for these types of assets which are notoriously difficult to value have come under further pressure
3475521 id guess thats because there are more sellers in the market than buyers and more banks are trying to liquidate their portfolios theres a clear supply and demand imbalance
3475522 based on managements current economic outlook quarterly net charge offs in the home equity portfolio could continue to increase during the remainder of 2008 prime and subprime mortgage net charge offs are expected to continue to rise significantly during the second half of 2008 with deterioration expected to continue into 2009
3475523 continued housing price declines could also lead to increases in noncredit losses including losses on repurchases of previously securitized loans
3475524 loan losses remain too high expense levels are too high revenue trends in certain businesses can be questioned most important the company ceo is giving clear warning that developments in the next few quarters could be threatening ignoring a ceos warning is never a wise practice

3475529 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3475530 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3475537 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3475538 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3475569 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
3475570 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
3475571 our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable pollution free energy for our nation and it has been there all along right under our feet

3475576 as a new jersey company that employs over 600 people in the state linde is pleased to sponsor this local event we hope it will raise awareness of the need to develop alternative energy technologies to promote a cleaner environment for new jersey residents and for the entire country
3475577 linde is an expert in designing and delivering hydrogen refueling technology we have equipped more public hydrogen refuelling stations than any other company over 70 stations in 15 countries we also have performed over 120 000 hydrogen vehicle refuellings the most of any hydrogen supplier we believe our participation in this tour will prove that its practical for average citizens to drive hydrogen cars and refuel easily
3475578 this experience combined with our global size and scale enables us to execute projects safely and successfully it also gives us the expertise to deliver new and sustainable energy solutions that contribute to a greener world and cleaner environment

3475590 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other

3475600 it is ever more urgent that we investigate the possibility of a long term solution in the form of a new and more eco friendly international airport
3475601 the mayor is keen to know what the alternatives are to expansion at heathrow and would like to know whether the idea of a new airport in the thames estuary would be viable or not
3475602 he has asked officers to consider the feasibility of a new airport to see if the idea is worth further consideration

3475606 the broad availability of music and visual arts courses in wisconsin public school districts is good news
3475607 however there has been an obvious decline in participation we need to find out what is precipitating that decline
3475608 were seeing arts programs erode not just in wisconsin but across the united states
3475609 ideally schools should provide access for all four of the arts disciplines music visual art theater and dance
3475610 generally speaking wisconsin schools are only offering music and visual art
3475611 only four school districts in the state offer dance at the high school level
3475612 culturally speaking it is very surprising that rural school districts often place more emphasis on arts education than urban districts
3475613 art programs in rural areas are often an important cultural engagement for the community
3475614 we found that the economic status of a community is not a factor at all in regards to the availability of arts courses
3475615 in fact we found poorer communities actually provide more arts programs
3475616 there may be a great inequity among schools in the same district regarding what courses are available
3475617 this study will help us determine what additional information we need
3475618 it is a call to action wisconsin needs to put more emphasis on arts education to prepare students for the future
3475619 what starts out as a trickle can easily turn into a flood
3475620 arts courses enhance the imagination creativity and innovation all qualities young people will need to be successful in the 21st century

3475630 you can actually build your own private label social network and blog publishing site
3475631 the type of web site that you build with movable type doesnt have to look like a classic two or three column blog
3475632 it can be structured to look like any web site you see surfing the web web publishing is moving from a heavily process driven activity to being something more decentralized something more inclusive of community and being able to build web sites in a more rapid and agile fashion we really view movable type as part of sea change in web content management toward a social publishing direction

3475657 that was hilarious i should put that on the blog
3475658 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3475659 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3475660 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3475661 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3475662 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married
3475663 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3475664 at the moment many leukemias are treated with chemotherapy that destroys the diseased blood cells and bone marrows as well as normal cells
3475665 we hope this discovery will lead to targeted therapies more specific to the malfunctioning cells seen in diseases such as leukemia
3475666 identifying the specific normal cells that cancer come from can provide critical insight into how cancers develop this may help us develop more rational and effective approaches to treatment
3475667 simply mutating a gene is not enough to cause cancer the mutation has to happen in the right cell type at the right time in the case of patched gnps provide the critical context for tumor formation
3475668 studies have shown that when used in combination with optimal medical therapy crt is associated with a 50 percent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure and a 36 percent reduction in mortality or death
3475669 we did this study to analyze if and how this new therapy is being used in u s hospitals
3475670 thats a small percentage when you consider that we estimate 30 percent to 50 percent of hospitalized patients with heart failure were eligible for crt based on previous studies
3475671 that means that there are a lot of patients who potentially could benefit from the device who arent receiving it
3475672 we also found that 10 percent of patients discharged with a new crt implant had an lvef of greater than 35 percent which suggests that those patients are over treated they have not been shown in trials to benefit from the therapy
3475673 we studied one of the systems that remove damaged proteins
3475674 the liver cells were able to maintain the same level of activity as when they were young
3475675 as we understand why this system decreases with aging we are trying to identify compounds that do the same thing
3475676 also we are looking at dietary manipulation some modifications in the diet might do the same thing
3475677 another piece of evidence supporting the contention that aging is a reversible condition we can not only slow aging but also reverse many forms of aging
3475678 from the pure science point of view it is impressive
3475679 weve previously found that a low risk lifestyle was very important in preventing coronary and diabetes and now weve also found that these healthy habits can lower your risk of stroke
3475680 a healthy lifestyle is associated with an 80 percent lower risk for ischemic stroke compared to people who have none of these lifestyle factors
3475681 more than half of ischemic strokes might have been prevented if everyone adhered to these healthy lifestyle factors
3475682 these things you can do yourself without your doctors intervention are very important in making you healthier this study tells us that were in the drivers seat and hopefully gets people more engaged in the process of trying to make themselves healthier
3475683 our study is the first to specifically examine psa screening in younger men which provides an important assessment of quality of care especially for high risk groups
3475684 further investigation will be required to understand the impact of new risk stratification strategies with particular focus on the policy implications of potentially large increases in health care resource use
3475685 i think this study demonstrates that the problem of refractive eyesight errors is on the increase particularly in terms of the amount of nearsightedness in the american population
3475686 no one knows for sure what accounts for this but its a pretty smart hypothesis that the increased amount of near work that were doing as a population may be increasing the incidence of nearsightedness and it does suggest that we should be looking into ways to deal with it
3475687 i would hazard to suggest that in general the widespread prevalence of refractive issues today could be related to environmental factors like extensive use of tv and computers and among the young video games because today we get much heavier loads on our eyes from all of that and those are strenuous activities for our vision
3475688 half the u s population needs glasses of some sort so this does not strike me as unusual at all
3475689 and so even though many patients routinely come in concerned about having a surgical problem its much more often this sort of issue im a surgeon but im very happy to tell people you dont need surgery and often they dont they just need eyeglasses
3475690 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
3475691 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3475692 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
3475693 almost all of us gastroenterologists and internists have become complacent about the use of these medications
3475694 this makes us all take a step back and look at all the patients we have on these medications and ask whether they require still being on this medication at this dosage at this frequency can we make some alterations in their dosing regimen can we switch them do they need to be on anything at all at this point
3475695 from this newest article the comfortable zone looks like a length of time longer than the other studies seven years which is a nice amount of time thats enough time for any type of peptic ulcer disease to improve
3475696 some people think if i take ppis i can eat garbage all day long
3475697 we need to tighten up on those patients these medications are not without any kind of risk
3475698 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3475699 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status
3475700 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be
3475701 salt sensitivity in children is low and rises with increasing age through adulthood
3475702 during adolescence about 18 percent to 20 percent of adolescents in the general population have the condition however in the study salt sensitivity was present in 37 percent of all low birth weight lbw and in 47 percent of the children who were small for gestational age sga
3475703 these children should be followed for signs of reduced renal function and also for an elevated blood pressure
3475704 theres nearly a 50 percent chance of favorably affecting blood pressure by simply reducing salt intake in children born sga and nearly a 40 percent chance for those born with lbw these individuals can be determined very easily if their family physician just gets data on their births
3475705 customer experience on iphone 3g or any device can vary based on a number of factors including proximity to the cell site buildings trees terrain and the number of people on the network at a given time we and apple are working continuously to ensure people have a great experience on the iphone and we urge our customers to synch iphone 3g to itunes frequently to ensure they have the latest software updates
3475706 while fiercely competing in the marketplace does create some degree of tension or even mistrust between two companies that activity also creates a lot of common ground for discussion about the market and the future
3475707 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3475708 people who lost excess weight were more likely to attain their blood sugar and blood pressure goals than people who gained weight or maintained a stable weight
3475709 we looked at their weight over three years and looked at blood sugar and blood pressure readings in the fourth year
3475710 we used all of the weights available to plot these trajectories
3475711 thats how we were able to identify this weight loss group
3475712 you shouldnt get discouraged if you regain some or all of what you lose because your blood sugar and blood pressure control may still be better
3475713 one possibility is had we looked further out the benefit may be gone
3475714 the other possibility is there are long term benefits to weight loss even if the weight is regained
3475715 the study is a reminder that we need to diagnose diabetes early we need to treat it aggressively as soon as it is diagnosed to maintain the remission of the diabetic state
3475716 we dont want people to think ill lose weight and then oh its ok to regain
3475717 even if you cant maintain the weight loss results this shows it is worth making the extra effort to lose weight as soon as you find out you have type 2 diabetes

3475732 theres no connection whatsoever between cholesterol in food and cholesterol in blood and weve known that all along cholesterol in diet doesnt matter at all
3475733 the more saturated fat one ate the more cholesterol one ate the more calories one ate the lower peoples serum cholesterol
3475734 a raised cholesterol lipoprotein level does not cause heart disease
3475735 for decades enormous human and financial resources have been wasted on the cholesterol campaign more promising research areas have been neglected producers and manufacturers of animal food all over the world have suffered economically and millions of healthy people have been frightened and badgered into eating a tedious and flavorless diet or into taking potentially dangerous drugs for the rest of their lives as the scientific evidence in support of the cholesterol campaign is non existent we consider it important to stop it as soon as possible
3475736 cholesterol and mortality 30 years of follow up from the framingham study
3475737 frankly if you believe any of this you will believe anything
3475738 i began what turned into a 25 year journey of discovery
3475739 well hey like havent about ten million people been saying this for the last fifty years
3475740 so how can anyone say that stress causes heart disease when there is so little agreement as to what causes heart disease and there is even little agreement as to what stress actually means its a good question in order to answer it i have to attempt to define rather more clearly what i mean by stress
3475741 you can hardly find an eminent cardiologist who has not been given honoraria by at least one pharmaceutical company that manufactures statins and the sums involved are far from small we are talking in many cases hundreds of thousands of dollars per year i know for i ahem have signed some of the checks
3475742 the extent of the connections were stunning of the nine members on the panel six had each received research grants speaking honoraria or consulting fees from at least three and in some cases all five of the manufacturers of statins
3475743 the drug companies increasingly design the studies they keep the data they dont even let the researchers see the data they analyze the data they decide whether theyre going to even publish the data at the end of it they sign contracts with the academic medical centers saying that they dont get to publish the work unless they get permission from the drug company
3475744 what if you put 250 people in a room and told them they would each pay 1000 a year for a drug they would have to take every day that many would get diarrhea and muscle pain and that 249 would have no benefit and they could do just as well by exercising how many would take that
3475745 have too much influence over the government officials who regulate them
3475746 the goal is to make as much buzz as possible
3475747 the commercial portrays the arab as a person who is short tempered aggressive and foul mouthed
3475748 we got a request from nissan international to remove the ad and not to use it again
3475749 the gulf arabs are just a symbol for rich people i think its a great ad our role is to do our job in the best way possible we dont need to take into account the feelings of the arabs
3475750 we are sorry that there are people who did not understand the advertisement and we hope that now after the subject was clarified that they understand that it was all done with humour and without any intention to hurt anyone
3475751 oh yes ill help you mulch i know just the place to buy it

3475757 the mental health needs of returning servicemembers and their families have been a strong focus of our organization for several years now weve made a point of bringing this issue to our members attention and are committed to helping provide counselors with the resources they need to address this growing challenge weve offered multiple educational sessions on this topic at our conferences over the past several years and also offer ongoing access to publications and continuing education courses on our web site in addition we have advocated for federal laws that will provide military troops with greater access to mental health care
3475758 were pleased to have aca participation in this survey and we applaud the many efforts they have made to focus attention on this issue
3475759 like the aca capella has a strong interest in the issue of military mental health because mental health professionals and military personnel represent two of our largest groups of students we believe a big part of the challenge in meeting servicemembers mental health needs is making sure there are enough qualified professionals to address the need our online counseling and psychology programs including the only online caprep accredited counseling specializations make it more feasible to pursue advanced degrees in the mental health field
3475760 sesungguhnya allah tidak melihat rupa dan harta hata kamu tapi melihat hati dan perbuatanmu
3475761 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3475762 i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3475763 we didnt have a fight no one cheated it plain didnt work
3475764 i dont want to name names even though he probably deserves it but he fooled around
3475765 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3475766 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3475767 what if i dont earn any more next year what if something awful happens
3475768 we used to think all fat did was store energy
3475769 now we know that fat tissue is hormone producing tissue it may act differently in different people
3475770 the higher an obese persons activity level the larger the decrease in liver fat
3475771 in our study the obese people with better risk profiles tended to have more physical activity and the normal weight people with worse risk factors tended to have characteristics associated with lower physical activity levels
3475772 for any particular disease there are many people with risk factors that do not get the disease and many people without risk factors who do
3475773 weve known for a long time that although obesity is a risk factor for heart disease many obese people dont have that risk but across the population those with more body fat will have an increased incidence of heart disease and those with the apple shaped upper body obesity are at greater risk than those with the pear shaped lower body obesity
3475774 in addition to cardiovascular risk and diabetes risk there is
3475775 at the moment we see that the lifestyle intervention in general has effects on reducing liver fat more than total body fat
3475776 many people stop the program because they are not happy with a body weight decrease of just a few kilograms but the liver fat goes down very much and their metabolism increases very much they must realize this has benefits so it is important to tell people to stick with it even if they dont lose much weight
3475777 the most important factor is not how much you exercise but what the effect your exercise has in increasing your fitness
3475778 it looks like at the same level of exercise some people increase their fitness and others dont it looks like there are fitness non responders and those non responders dont have that good an effect of exercise on liver fat
3475779 we are seeing fitness as the most important factor and then on top of that reduction of intake of carbs has a strong effect
3475780 so far our recommendations are increased physical activity four hours per week of moderate activity and reduced carbs we also recommend a reduced intake of saturated fat
3475781 ive never discussed this on my blog before but recent developments have prompted me to discuss the reason why im no longer a teacher isnt always a good thing i separated early this year with my school as a peaceful way to avoid a public scandal that would ultimately affect my teenage daughter who attended said school part of my agreement i cannot legally discuss specifically the reasons and terms of my separation but use your imaginations i can say that i agreed to leave quietly and peacefully under the condition that my honors courses award winning athlete without a discipline record child be allowed to attend her last year of middle school just as if i had resigned at the end of the year let me spell this out for you faculty receive a substantial tuition discount i pay 10 of the tuition this roughly amounts to 1 100 after leaving all faculty are offered one more year for their children at the faculty tuition discount as a way to avoid disrupting their childrens lives too much
3475782 and while the company does business in 26 countries its contracts in china alone could keep foster wheeler busy for several years
3475783 foster wheeler operates in two segments the global engineering and construction group designs and builds energy processing facilities worldwide
3475784 the company has a dod contract to develop a gasification unit that will be used in 21 coal fired electric plants the systems being produced by foster wheeler emit no airborne pollutants and are cost effective i think the technology has enormous potential

3475924 physical therapists are often one of the first health care providers that patients with acute low back pain encounter whether they are referred by medical doctors or visit them directly which offers evidenced based pts a tremendous opportunity to help patients recover
3475925 considering that low back pain will affect between sixty and eighty percent of americans during their lifetime the potential cost savings of an early effective intervention to prevent individuals from progressing to chronic disability may be considerable
3475926 the findings from this research can be applied throughout all fields of medicine not just to physical therapy
3475927 if all physicians and therapists adhere to their fields recommended clinical practice guidelines they too should see a decrease in subsequent health care utilization it is our hope that this research will help physical therapists as well as all medical professionals do their job more effectively

3476007 when the canadian government announced it was shutting down the promart cultural diplomacy program it named me as one of the free loaders who abuse the grant system in my case by going off to cuba to misrepresent true canadian values
3476008 a left wing columnist and author who has plenty of money to travel on his own
3476009 those grants never should have been approved and the criteria should be tightened to prevent such abuses

3476012 these ice cores reveal that west antarcticas climate is influenced by atmospheric and oceanic changes thousands of miles to the north
3476013 these results help put antarcticas recent climate trends into a global context
3476014 these results are the first to demonstrate that we can unambiguously detect that influence in ice core records

3476021 we cannot secure enough delegates to win we cannot overtake him the math simply doesnt work it is imperative that we provide a clear and tenable answer to the single most important question we face
3476022 i think its fantastic that we bounced back from the first 15 minutes against norway
3476023 you look at the first 15 minutes of that game to the last 15 minutes of this game and many things have happened the whole team and myself have gained confidence every minute weve been together the good part of this road is that we have experienced both sides losing and winning thats good going into the quarterfinals where its now or never
3476024 dont be fooled by obamas smooth talk he will raise your taxes allow gays to marry take your guns away and he wont support our troops we cannot stand by as this tax and spend liberal lays waste to america
3476025 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3476026 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3476027 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3476028 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3476029 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law

3476033 when you go to a completely new place there is so much excitement and wonder that this takes over for a while before the gut starts churning for home when you go to a place you already know especially if youve visited with loved ones then the newness is not there and the churning happens sooner
3476034 eu tenho feito de conta que voc n o me interessa muito mas n o verdade voc a pessoa mais especial que j conheci n o por ser bonito ou por pensar como eu sobre tantas coisas mas por algo maior e mais ser correspondida o que menos me importa no momento preciso dizer o que sinto

3476039 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3476040 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3476041 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3476042 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity
3476043 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3476044 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3476045 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3476046 because of excessive revisions and inputs from a wide number of people the draft policy now sounds more like a law than a policy
3476047 and this was exactly the observation of the law ministry about the policy when the energy ministry sent the draft to the law ministry a few months back
3476048 that is why the law ministry observed that instead of such a policy the government should work on several laws instead of just one
3476049 once the government acquires a piece of land it cant be returned to the original owner the government can however restore the land and allow its agricultural use
3476050 there has been no study by any group about such an open pit mine in barapukuria how can this committee suggest this besides who would invest for a test case if there is no guarantee of any profit
3476051 again technically you also need bigger land for an open pit mine the barapukuria mine area has a power plant and other structures then is this a feasible idea or just an undue idea
3476052 it is impossible to express god and even more impossible to conceive god
3476053 dont you understand this might be the only moment you have could they do anything in this moment that would make you love them less tell them tell them
3476054 we dont yet have peace but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress there is still much work to be done what we want is to secure the best result
3476055 you know lunatics difference from other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery
3476056 i promise you today that ill remind them of everything they have done and one day we will win
3476057 barbarians look this is georgian democracy if it werent for russia we would have already been buried here
3476058 theres still some occasional sniper fire but we are finishing them off steadily and surely
3476059 first parties to the conflict must not resort to force second they absolutely stop any military action third there must be free access to humanitarian aid fourth the georgian armed forces need to be returned to their permanent bases fifth the russian armed forces will be moved back to their positions before the military action sixth the beginning of international discussion of south ossetias and abkhazias future status
3476060 despite the russian presidents claims earlier this morning that military operations against georgia have been suspended at this moment russian fighter jets are bombarding two georgian villages outside south ossetia
3476061 georgian forces continued to fire at peacekeepers unfortunately people were killed yesterday there was no ceasefire from the georgian side

3476067 eva and victoria are obsessed with the game and spend most of their evenings going out for a civilized meal and then getting stuck into a meaty tournament but they realized there are no venues which provide dinner and focus on this new hollywood craze
3476068 so when eva said she was opening a new branch of beso in the gambling capital of the world victoria had the brainwave of turning it into a place which specialises in food and their favorite game eva will oversee the restaurant while victoria channels her energies into the casino

3476073 we have to drill here and drill now drill here and drill now
3476074 because oil prices are determined on the international market any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
3476075 our energy plan will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future so that no young american in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the middle east
3476076 parents do not have an unfettered right to dictate the terms of their childrens education
3476077 as children age direct caretaking and influence diminish and children are often seen by their parents as peers with whom they are have continuing relationships
3476078 although our results suggest these patterns of change and continuity differ by parent and child gender our analyses suggest important similarities among mothers and fathers within the same family
3476079 the analysis suggests that mothers and fathers in the same families in our study rarely reported divergent experiences with their young adult sons and daughters
3476080 overwhelmingly the examination of mothers and fathers responses revealed similarities in their experiences as parents to their young adult children
3476081 frank is a true asset to wynnchurch in terms of his breadth of industry knowledge and hands on operating experience we look forward to a long and successful partnership with frank

3476083 der spd landesvorstand und frau ypsilanti w ren gut beraten wenn sie sich an das erinnern was sie den menschen versprochen haben als sie sie um ihre stimme baten
3476084 und sie w ren klug beraten sich die optionen anzusehen die sie haben auch wenn sie dabei anerkennen m ssen dass der spd landesvorstand in hessen nicht die st rkste sondern nur die zweitst rkste partei repr sentiert
3476085 dass meine neigungen eher bei fdp und gr nen liegen habe ich oft genug gesagt aber das ndert nichts daran dass die spd nicht behaupten kann sie h tte keine alternative dazu ihre menschen in einen wortbruch zu f hren
3476086 the operation that the reinforced russian peace keeping contingent carried out has been completed because the goal that we set ourselves has been achieved
3476087 the aggressor has been punished and its armed forces have been disorganized
3476088 i dont think moscow will be in the mood not only to hold talks but even to speak to saakashvili
3476089 he has committed crimes against our citizens our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner hed better quit
3476090 bigger part of the operation to coerce the georgian side to peace in south ossetia
3476091 deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3476092 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3476093 we hope russia will join the broad consensus that is emerging that this has gone on for too long
3476094 implications for the region implications for the future relations of russia with the united states and the other international communities
3476095 for us the situation is not as simple as our american colleagues or our georgian colleagues would like us or others to see
3476096 our forces are continuing to take steps which would make sure that georgian forces do not have the ability to invade south ossetia again
3476097 their accounting is so distorted it recalls the phrase the big lie
3476098 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3476099 the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3476100 weve got offices across the state and a very robust operation
3476101 our move to a larger facility in lexington allows us to continue the momentum generated by our aggressive growth curve in providing technology sector recruiting and consulting services to our customers
3476102 we have adopted an aggressive growth strategy during this economic climate because our clients continue to demand quality it people through our top gun recruiting solutions
3476103 politicians wife spread more than once this year but there are some positive things about it
3476104 thats how i like my barack amp michelle thats also why i think hell be a good president
3476105 in the account of his sons adoption michael perlitz referred to honduras as a banana republic
3476106 when rural hondurans or filipinos cannot make ends meet on the wages they earn and have no land on which to grow food they have great difficulty providing for their children some move to the cities in the hope of better opportunities that may not exist often the father leaves and the family never manages to be reunited relinquishing a child for adoption may be the only way to keep the child fed
3476107 what does it mean to feel responsible for these conditions if the worlds wealth were distributed equitably what would the common standard of living be what would we americans have to give up can we in our daily lives make principled choices that in the long run enable these families to provide for their children
3476108 why dont the american moms and dads just send money to the korean moms and dads so they can keep their children
3476109 let me go on record saying that i have never ever given her any advice on what to wear
3476110 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
3476111 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information
3476112 insight into the number of people who have seen an ad campaign
3476113 how many users visited their sites after seeing an ad
3476114 google is slowly embracing a full blown behavioral targeting over its vast network of services and sites
3476115 people are starting to see oh we have these different industries that are collecting the same types of information to profile individuals and the devices they use on the network
3476116 internet cellphones cable any way you tap into the network concerns are raised
3476117 a broad approach to protecting peoples online privacy seems both desirable and inevitable
3476118 advertisers and data collectors who record where customers go and what they do want profit at the expense of privacy

3476132 its been circled on my calendar for about two years
3476133 they know well be coming back to redeem ourselves everyones excited
3476134 theyve played together for so long and run their system so well
3476135 well have to improve our outside shooting myself in particular and michael redd those teams will sit back and dare us to shoot the ball its been a struggle i have to adjust to being a spot up shooter but when big games come around theyre going to fall
3476136 its a long tournament were getting shots so eventually theyll go in
3476137 i dont know i just went for it in soccer theres no better feeling than scoring early
3476138 i was so proud of amy how she finished that
3476139 we have to focus on the things we can control
3476140 during the games next year china will host 280 000 athletes referees journalists and other workers from more than 200 countries and regions about five million overseas tourists and more than 120 million domestic travelers will visit beijing in 2008 and seven million spectators will watch the games at the venues according to official statistics
3476141 weve seen rfid in a variety of places where its found incredible value but many of those were in closed systems in a controlled environment such as toll roads or access control and security
3476142 as the rfid footprint expands the collaboration has been pronounced
3476143 there are many partnerships that are being created by companies in different parts of the world such as between european vendors and chinese vendors the main focus is on creating end to end solutions for customers
3476144 theres a chance here to show how people from different countries can work together
3476145 as you can imagine the amount of food moving into and around the game is pretty immense
3476146 the rfid and sensor system allows someone with a reader to see if a food has gone outside a temperature range rather than just reading a bar code to determine that its the correct box that makes the data more dynamic and we can see that it could have a lot of impact in the future
3476147 rfid tickets have been used before in china to defeat counterfeiting such as for admittance at the great wall of china and tennis events but the scope of this implementation is what makes it unique
3476148 identification management has been an area where rfid has been used since the early days
3476149 but now with the ticketing aspect youre going to see the anti counterfeiting space really expand
3476150 ticket for the cure is successfully raising money to educate women about the importance of early detection and the need for routine mammograms and breast exams to help women get the routine exams they need we expanded the illinois breast and cervical cancer program to provide free breast and cervical cancer screenings to all uninsured women
3476151 i encourage everyone to continue supporting ticket for the cure to raise awareness of the importance of early detection and to use the ticket to start a conversation about how the illinois breast and cervical cancer program can help women take advantage of potentially life saving screenings and treatment
3476152 so many lives are touched by breast cancer and nearly all of us know of someone affected by this disease
3476153 these ticket for the cure grants will help fund educational seminars speakers and literature as well as health fairs and outreach efforts to better combat the impacts breast cancer can have on our lives
3476154 purchasing a ticket for the cure is the perfect way to have fun and join in the fight against breast cancer at the same time and i encourage everyone 18 and older to purchase a ticket
3476155 the net proceeds of the ticket for the cure scratch off lottery game have been granted to illinois not for profit organizations dedicated to providing breast cancer education support and research
3476156 our hope is that the programs offered by the grantees are utilized by everyone as a breast cancer husband i know first hand how peer support and knowledge of this disease and its treatment options empowers the survivor and family
3476157 we are not planning to attack anyone but our partners should clearly understand that the armed forces will be used if necessary to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the russian federation and its allies including on a preventative basis including with the use of nuclear weapons
3476158 military force can and must be used to demonstrate the decisiveness of the top leadership of the country
3476159 what baluyev sky means is the enhanced deterrence doctrine which was created in the united states
3476160 soon we will not be able to maintain missile defense
3476161 under these conditions a potential enemy will gain the ability to carry out high precision strikes coordinated in terms of time and space on practically any target on russian territory
3476162 as for our allies we will see whos ready to join our nuclear umbrella
3476163 loro non si vedono uguali ma noi li etichettiamo li rendiamo uguali per poterli meglio emarginare
3476164 sesungguhnya allah tidak melihat rupa dan harta hata kamu tapi melihat hati dan perbuatanmu
3476165 because it did not accomplish an adequate level of success to sustain the business
3476166 weve known service king and its leaders for many years and we have a great deal of respect for them
3476167 they provided auto glass repair and replacement in the past and didnt accomplish what they hoped to accomplish and because we have been in the business for more than 70 years we provided support to launch service king auto glass
3476168 i dont know any other way to possibly explain this to you
3476169 shi tou not her real name a lesbian is seen in front of a rainbow flag during a campaign to promote the acceptance of homosexuality in beijing february 14 2008
3476170 let us conclude this short series by considering a few answers to these three questions our churches today are full of lost unregenerate people who are headed for a christ less eternity yet it is not difficult to read past history to find that when the word of god was preached in its entirety that lives were changed ministers stood to give forth the word and would address the minds of those who were sitting in the pews they would encourage the listener that if they had ears to hear that they the listener should be attentive to the word and show forth fruits of obedience the preacher could stand and preach for 2 3 hours and the people returned week after week to be convicted of their sin once again
3476171 it is all about matchups and styles i beat the current world championship world champion in the semifinals and fought the girl who lost to that girl in the finals
3476172 but her style was not good for me and i ended up losing so a lot of it is by the luck of the draw a lot of it is how good of a day you have but most of it is about how you train
3476173 it is definitely challenging for sure but it is meant to be that way i qualified the berth for the olympics for women in september at the world championships so that is pretty motivating realizing i can hold my ground against the top international paddlers
3476174 we were very disappointed at the vote last time to eliminate the sport with the vote coming up in 2009 we feel that our performance in the 2008 olympics will go a long way baseball needs to be in the olympics
3476175 this isnt like batman film dark knight where heath ledger died while editing was in its infancy most of our editing is done
3476176 well go back and see if there is anything we can do better i want my movie to be a tribute to both of them

3476182 firefighters put their lives on the line day in and day out too often we forget the safety of our communities depends on firefighters and others who devote their lives to protecting us this legislation provides new tools that will help them perform their jobs safely and effectively
3476183 we need to do everything possible to protect those who put themselves at risk to protect us i am proud to have sponsored this bill and hope it will save lives
3476184 we are glad to see this legislation signed into law
3476185 i am pleased that firefighters are getting more protections under the law as they continue to put themselves in dangerous situations day in and day out to save the lives of others
3476186 its important that first responders have the same protections as police officers when performing their official duties
3476187 recently unauthorized chris brown material was leaked online most of the unfinished songs were demos and reference tracks brown and his production team were writing and producing for other artists browns record label jive records is doing everything possible to prevent any further illegal distribution of these tracks
3476188 this is a new and innovative approach to deal with a very serious traffic safety issue
3476189 far too many people are killed and injured each year by drunk drivers this law uses technology to target dui offenders in an effort to make our roads safer while posing no inconvenience to the vast majority of illinoisans who are safe and responsible drivers
3476190 madds campaign to eliminate drunk driving includes interlocks for all offenders nationwide upon first offense because we know it will stop the revolving door on drunk driving
3476191 we give special thanks to the leadership of secretary white senator john cullerton representative robert molaro and representative john damico for passing legislation that will help make the roads of illinois safer than before
3476192 i commend madd and president laura dean mooney for their invaluable support on this initiative in illinois as well as their efforts to enact similar legislation throughout the country in an effort to prevent the senseless tragedies caused by drunk driving
3476193 we should do everything we can to fight drunk driving and make our highways safer
3476194 this new law will save countless lives and you cannot put a dollar amount on that
3476195 everyones struggling right now with having a job but it definitely benefits everybody

3476203 debates here have stressed the need to develop an active science aimed at responding to the peoples immediate needs based on applied research development of applications and extension and also designed to solve long term problems
3476204 in this context it was recommended that we should speed up strengthening of the existing research institutions particularly those related to agricultural production and agro processing because of their potential to contribute to the success of the green revolution the creation of jobs generation of income and mitigation of the food and energy crises
3476205 mozambique is rich in resources and their value chain could be increased if they are adequately exploited but we have to develop such techniques and divulge them among the productive sectors

3476332 weve done a great job in public health convincing people that cancer screening tests work
3476333 were uncomfortable with the notion that some screening tests work and others dont that seems mystifying to people
3476334 screening tests dont only pick up life threatening cancers they pick up tumors that look identical to traditional tumors but they dont have the same biologic behavior
3476335 some are so slow growing they never would have caused medical problems in the persons natural life span
3476336 even a harmful screening test could appear on the surface as a helpful test

3476339 i think the burden is on medicine to try and generate some evidence that the net benefits are there before drawing that tube of blood

3476451 in todays rapid fire political atmosphere of cable news talk radio and the internet media analysts can easily make the mistake of believing that the leading network news outlets were tough on a candidate because of the general perception of how the entire media old media and new media brought a controversy to the publics attention
3476452 but voters who sampled only a light menu of news from big three network tv could easily have missed the depths of reverend wrights outrageous remarks no one could find in these stories a scouring scrutiny of obamas decades of membership in his controversial church

3476489 after a tough learning curve last year it has been good to see how the team has performed this year i still think we missed an opportunity to really push the top two but overall i am pleased to see how the team has grown and look forward to hopefully an even further improvement next year

3476667 by denying people the right to be seen as beautiful you cause deep cultural resentment

3476674 i had a feeling from the day parcells got hired that this was going to be the case
3476675 i am convinced that christianity as an historical religion needs to listen very carefully to its history in order to build on the past strengths and avoid repetition of its past mistakes
3476676 hace muy poco tiempo que nos prometimos entonces no lo estamos tomando con tranquilidad tengo 23 a os y no hay ninguna raz n de precipitarse todo debe ser natural y relajado
3476677 soy muy afortunada porque formo parte de una relaci n s lida y c moda
3476678 creo plenamente en el cari o y en dar a mi pareja todo el amor que puedo dar
3476679 las relaciones m s sanas y m s inspiradoras son aquellas en las que est s tan c modo con otra persona que aprendes m s sobre ti misma y conoces cosas tuyas que nunca habr a apreciado antes
3476680 dont know what an rss is click here to find out
3476681 tomara que nunca precisemos puxar essa alavanca mas ser amos irrespons veis se n o tiv ssemos uma alavanca dessas para puxar
3476682 man in deutschland acht wochen auf ein berlanges bett warten muss
3476683 es handelt sich um ein gemeinsames projekt wodurch junge bands die m glichkeit haben vor einem gro en publikum aufzutreten
3476684 das beste daran ist dass die jugendlichen ihre lieblingsband selbst im internet w hlen k nnen es gibt keine prominent besetzte jury
3476685 die offizielle anmeldefrist endet am 1 september bis zu diesem zeitpunkt kann man sich auf anmelden doch auch nachher ist eine anmeldung m glich
3476686 2007 hatten wir zwar ein n chtigungsminus von rund zwei prozent daf r ist die wertsch pfung gegen ber dem vorjahr um zw lf prozent gestiegen
3476687 dort suchen die g ste vor allem die pers nliche betreuung die solche h user anbieten k nnen
3476688 das k nnen gef hrte wanderungen mit dem chef plus einkehr in eine h tte sein
3476689 damals musste man auf m glichst wenig grundfl che m glichst viel leistbaren wohnraum schaffen
3476690 wir wissen dass es dem heutigen zeitgeist optisch nicht mehr entspricht und haben auch an r ckbau gedacht
3476691 ein gef lliger r ckbau um sechs gescho e h tte eine halbe million euro gekostet
3476692 wir haben eine klassisch elegante lochfassade vorgeschlagen die in hellbeige bis hellgrau gehalten ist und von der sich nur die fenster abheben
3476693 die neue farbgebung soll sich nicht knallig vom himmel abheben und den massigen bauk rper dezenter erscheinen lassen
3476694 they must be saying we cant keep our sites up but we dont think russian hackers can take down blogspot given googles much better infrastructure and ability to defend it
3476695 another interesting aspect is seeing how certain countries are what i call cyberlocked
3476696 we know a land locked country has no access to the sea
3476697 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3476698 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3476699 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3476700 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3476701 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3476702 the stylesheet has no tags add a tags line to your style css file and upload the zip file again
3476703 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3476704 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3476705 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3476706 so i read and article today in the english ethiopian newspaper 4 2 million orphans and orphaned mostly due to tb malaria and hiv in that order 4 2 million children is 5 of ethiopias population and you know those kids are hungry i thought of your efforts when i read this article
3476707 i would anticipate that a number of criminal cases would come out of this criminal investigation
3476708 and it is dangerous and that is where the left is headed
3476709 jeff wells of hollywood elsewhere inflamed the conservative community last week with a post that appeared to some to suggest that the vocally conservative actor jon voight should be blacklisted which earned him an invitation to appear before the altar of bill oreilly on fox news the oreilly factor
3476710 to develop an economic support package that will build on the resilience of the georgian economy and maintain stability
3476711 we are giving no details as we are working on it very quickly
3476712 there is a need for massive efforts by the international community to help the civilian victims of this conflict
3476713 the atmosphere in tbilisi is very heavy people feel alone they are afraid
3476714 in gori i saw people fleeing i saw holes from the bombing
3476715 the idea that there are no new ideas isnt a new idea at all in fact its a pretty old one
3476716 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3476717 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3476718 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3476719 were trying to get an assessment of exactly what it means what a halt means and whether its taken place
3476720 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3476721 everybodys a mad scientist and life is their lab were all trying to experiment to find a way to live to solve problems to fend off madness and chaos
3476722 wenn man ganz genau hinsieht m sste man davon wahrscheinlich jeden dritten lkw sofort aus dem verkehr ziehen
3476723 bis dorthin kann es bereits zu sp t sein die lkw m ssten direkt nach der einreise einem sicherheits check unterzogen werden gerade in nickelsdorf ist alles vorhanden was daf r n tig w re
3476724 not at all on the contrary many of the questions i asked cant be answered very specifically but they do probe whether the person has a basically scientific view of the world
3476725 the sincere and constant work of the army under a tense situation has ensured regular movement of supplies on national highway 1a
3476726 the government of india is working at wiping out the hurriyat leadership
3476727 we are also taking a list of senior citizens particularly those above the age of 80 years jail superintendents and medical officers have been told to interact with these inmates and submit recommendations on the extra care or facilities that can be extended to them
3476728 we are considering those who never had visitors over a period of one year as an orphan
3476729 custodial care is a vital part of prison administration prisoners with diabetes and hypertension are given special diet as per the recommendations of the medical officer
3476730 we will suggest to the government that more details of students be taken in the eamcet application to avoid such applicants
3476731 the status quo in south ossetia and abkhazia is no longer possible
3476732 the invasion plan was rehearsed and perfected during georgian american war games in georgia
3476733 the aggressor has been punished and has suffered considerable losses his armed forces have been disorganised
3476734 the government will take steps to engage all groups concerned from jammu as well as the kashmir valley in talks so that the issues could be resolved amicably to the satisfaction of all concerned
3476735 therefore there is no reason for agitation on this issue
3476736 i wish wisdom and goodwill prevail in jammu and kashmir and peace restored
3476737 the policy of the government is not to deny anyone ones right to express
3476738 he is a very good boxer but i knew that i would score
3476739 it will be a tough fight but i am here to win the gold i am ready to face the world champion because i want to be the no 1 in the world i will show this on august 15
3476740 he was good he used good technique and great tactics he was better than me
3476741 he is a class boxer just look at his determination
3476742 you got to attack if you want to score points
3476743 we are not pushing the valley into pakistans hands it was after a landslip and a blizzard had killed amarnath pilgrims in 1996 that the nitish sengupta committee was set up it recommended the setting up of the amarnath shrine board that was done by the farooq abdullah government following this there were two judgments of the jammu and kashmir high court on the subject those were being implemented when the peoples democratic party went back on decisions taken by its own ministers and the congress caved in
3476744 this was a bogey raised by separatists to justify their march to muzaffarabad
3476745 the home minister was talking the language of the separatists
3476746 why wait for 35 days before talking to the amarnath sangharsh samiti in jammu
3476747 those kashmiris who want to cross over to pakistan should be pushed there and never allowed to come back
3476748 in kashmir thousands have already been killed in similar circumstances and this is in no way the option to resolve the crisis
3476749 it has exposed indian democracy and also the administrations double standards in dealing with situation in srinagar and jammu
3476750 the department is keen on bringing the exclusive crops of karnataka under gi and a list of crops that have the potential to be brought under gi has been prepared
3476751 the department has applied for gi status for kamalapura red banana of gulbarga appemidi of shimoga and devanahalli chakotha
3476752 we have started the basic process including preparation of bio climate map dna fingerprinting photographic and videographic evidence for these crops
3476753 ive worked in animation for forty years and yet the only thing anyones gonna remember about me are those games
3476754 i just wanted to be out at the 50m point and thats where i was
3476755 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3476756 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3476757 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3476758 i am delighted i couldnt care less about the time
3476759 an olympic gold is an olympic gold the time the race none of it matters its all about the gold
3476760 by tunneling deep into their pasts their paranoias and anxieties their troubled romantic relationships their outsize dreams lacy delivers a sophisticated psychological study of an ascendant economic class
3476761 we believe this ordinance has accomplished its goal thus far of making sacramento a safer place
3476762 policies based on hard practical considerations rather than on moral or idealistic concerns
3476763 its unknowable when a deal will be reached but the president is due back from zimbabwe later today
3476764 since their formation the zimbabwe defence forces have remained steadfast in defending our national sovereignty and interests as well as our hard won independence
3476765 these sterling achievements have overcome numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community to destabilise our peace and stability and thus cause confusion in our country
3476766 no tenemos presi n presi n es no estar en europa porque un grande como el atl tico necesita estar todos los a os en europa sta es una final todos sabemos que tenemos que devolver a este equipo al lugar que se merece tenemos la firme convicci n de que tiene que estar donde se merece

3476776 maxon has spent the last 20 years developing some of the industrys most advanced 3d software technologies continually raising the bar for 3d animation software excellence
3476777 cinema 4d r11 is no exception this release contains the next generation features our customers worldwide have come to expect from maxon
3476778 projection man allows our artists to quickly project a painting onto geometry in a scene simplifying even the most complex setups which can be easily organized within a single photoshop file
3476779 we are pleased that maxon has created the cineman connection to pixars renderman directly from within cinema 4d
3476780 now maxon customers can benefit from pixars academy award winning rendering technology featured in ratatouille the incredibles and many others
3476781 our customers told us what they needed and we listened
3476782 this exciting new version is as ideal for the novice as it is for the power user who wants to produce compelling imagery in todays fast paced environments
3476783 they were retreating it wasnt panic but they were trying to leave one by one not in groups
3476784 we dont have anything we dont have food we left when the shelling started with very few things
3476785 we dont know whats going on and why the russians did this to us they said they were defending ossetians who are they defending here
3476786 if the russians say theyre defending the civilian population why dont they care about kodori gorge
3476787 they dont know where theyll go we have no idea theres so much confusion
3476788 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3476789 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them and their actuaries develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3476790 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community
3476791 symbolic link name is a dangling sym bolic link n
3476792 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3476793 this city used to be known for the sugar plant that operated here many years ago
3476794 today people know us as the home of the lopez family
3476795 thanks to them everyone will know where sugar land is after the olympics because they will no doubt come back winners
3476796 they would come home from school and after finishing their homework the oldest brother jean would start to train them back then it was nothing more than a sport and self defense but it wasnt long before they started to take it seriously and compete
3476797 i used to love watching martial arts competitions and i shared my admiration for the different disciplines with my children but what they have accomplished in this sport is completely their own i really had very little to do with it
3476798 since we were little they have instilled the values that a lot of hispanic families have that the most important thing is that the family comes first before anything i think that this family unity has been the great secret of our success
3476799 in our community we dont have enough models for our young people for example one of the moments that really influenced my life was when i saw oscar de la hoya win the gold medal in barcelona
3476800 watching an athlete with my skin color kissing a gold medal was really important to me because i could identify with him at that moment i remember that i cried with pride and i realized that you can achieve your dreams if you put your mind to it
3476801 im going for my third gold medal but the most important thing is that this time i am going with my two siblings who have the same goal i think that together we can leave a long lasting mark on the olympics because we have worked very hard to return with the three gold medals
3476802 i grew up with competition since i was girl i lived with the pressure to win because that was the example that my brothers set for me and they didnt treat me any differently because i was female i always demanded equality and that has made me really tough and able to handle the pressures that come with competing at a high level
3476803 i think the three of them understand what is expected of them in these games so they are pushing each other to give each training everything theyve got i have never seen so much determination and dedication
3476804 tenemos que devolver a este equipo al lugar que se merece a europa

3476824 se a ge rgia aceitar assinar a retirada de suas tropas e cumprir os seis princ pios a via de normaliza o ficar aberta
3476825 a fraude tanto na quest o da liberdade de escolha como fraudes que possam alterar resultado das elei es de uma maneira geral o nosso processo eleitoral em sentido amplo ainda comprometido ainda maculado e ainda contaminado por elementos estranhos
3476826 o eleitor condena essa postura n o acha certo que a pessoa troque seu voto por alguma vantagem

3476831 estamos convencidos de que o debate internacional do status da abkh zia e da oss tia do sul deve concluir com o reconhecimento de nossa independ ncia

3476846 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3476847 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3476848 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3476849 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3476850 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3476851 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3476852 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3476853 all i can tell you right now is that if it were something as simple as going to a foundry it would be very easy to do and talk about it but it is actually something we believe is uniquely tailored to amd and uniquely tailored to our customers and our company and therefore much more complex to do than just a general outsourcing scenario
3476854 that the thoughts prayers and support of the american people are with that great little nation as it struggles today
3476855 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3476856 the earthquake can shake the mountains and block rivers but it will never diminish our determination to unite and help each other in the face of these catastrophes

3477236 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3477237 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status

3477262 wir haben uns in eine ferienwohnung von bekannten zur ckgezogen der rummel geht uns auf die nerven und meine mutter braucht dringend ruhe
3477263 er hat sich scho f r etwas besonderes gehalten und er war auch anders als wir
3477264 in der fr h hat er eimal zur lehrerin gsagt als er verschlafen hat sei wecker is explodiert auf so was w rn mir nia kemma
3477265 er hat sich halt scho immer viel getraut war aufm pfiger als wir
3477266 dass er seine tochter entf hrt hat das spricht eigentlich f r ihn das macht nur ein vater der ein herz hat
3477267 das war ein ganz feiner mann der war landschaftsmaler wir haben ihm sogar mal ein bild abgekauft
3477268 i am firmly committed to opposing any right to work legislation that might be proposed or as it is more accurately called right to work for less
3477269 labor 2008 is so incredibly important to my campaign so many people in my districts are working families that would benefit from having labor friendly candidates in the statehouse i cant do it without that important kind of communication meaning member to member the phone banks and labor walks coming up here in august i hope that the folks that are giving of their time and giving of their energy realize how appreciate we are of their efforts because again we cant do it without you
3477270 with health care costs climbing it really starts to make people worried about whats going to happen as we get older as our children get older our members have good union jobs so we havent had to suffer as much as some others but with costs rising all the time were going to start to feel it more and more i mean if you stood just for a few hours outside of wishart hospital you would not believe how many people youd see getting turned away because they have no insurance thats why were supporting barack obama this year he understands that we need a change in this country when it comes to health care
3477271 its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog
3477272 were a small local roughly 170 members so a lot of things we have to tackle a lot stronger than some of the bigger locals because were such a small amount so weve ordered pamphlets off the working families toolkit on barack obama and some of his issues we looked them over liked them and ordered some more well be passing them out in our newsletters to our members at our union meetings and at our apprentice schools well also be passing them out at some of our larger jobs sites and doing some work site leafleting there
3477273 o que jo o luiz tem a ver com a meteorologia ningu m sabe mas depois que ele disse isso a madrugada de segunda para ter a feira registrou uma das maiores precipita es pluviom tricas dos ltimos tempos
3477274 right to work is the number one issue were looking at this year and were focusing on the legislature because of that
3477275 if the legislature would happen to go non labor friendly we would probably have right to work
3477276 the literature that we pass out will inform them of the issues and it will reinforce why they should vote when we go out there and knock on doors whether its for statehouse candidates or for barack obama that really makes the difference we give them the information they need to make sure theyre informed on how the candidates stand and to make sure we elect labor friendly statehouse candidates in november
3477277 weve got to get out there on the streets and inform people for working people going out and passing out literature getting them to go out and vote this is what we need we cant afford to have right to work in this state our middle class is already suffering and becoming the working poor we need to make sure that we give working families a voice this year so that we can protect ourselves and our families
3477278 well work with you to create trade deals that are fair for american workers well end tax incentives for companies that ship jobs overseas and reward companies that create jobs here at home well invest in building roads and bridges and finding new sources for alternative energy well fix and strengthen our education system protect our social security system and take on re building our economy from the community level up by creating and sustaining good jobs for working families in our country
3477279 i know what it means when a local union president or steward passes leaflets at a worksite because union members trust you they work along side you they elected you and recognize that you have their best interests at heart and because of that when you send that local union letter to active and retired members it means more than any other piece of political mail i also know how powerful conversations between union members are whether on the phones or at the doorstep
3477280 were really concerned with the misclassification of workers and also the referendums on public schools attached to the tax cap bill however one of our gravest concerns is right to work legislation the iron workers here in northwest indiana as well as across the state of indiana along with the rest of the building trades and the rest of the afl cio were very concerned wtih right to work we do feel that if we elect labor friendly candidates in indianapolis that we can hold this off
3477281 the reason we need to is because the title is so misleading it should be right to wreck it removes the ability of people to pay taxes because it puts the middle class out of work it removes the ability for the middle class to have insurance without having health and welfare the insurance has to fall on someone and thats the state of indiana
3477282 right to work undermines unions and their ability to collectively bargain
3477283 last session we did have an amendment that came up that was put on a bill that had similar language but had nothing to do with right to work you see something like this come up and you see what some people are trying to do theyre trying to sneak this through they think you wont notice or that you dont understand the language thats in the amendment well we voted that sucker right down
3477284 in northwest indiana we have a tremendous union base and without the unions i may not get elected its very important to have their support behind me they are an integral part of my campaign and i hope they know they can come to me as well
3477285 anderson used to be a busy place where you could raise a family and have a nice life with the plants pulling out the entire community has just been destroyed it didnt stop with just the manufacturing jobs all of the other industries the restaurants the services theyre all gone now
3477286 in the 1970s there used to be 30 000 uaw members in the town of anderson people could take home a good paycheck and take care of their families now there are none left and its very difficult to maintain a decent living and with the foreclosure crisis people are just abandoning their houses completely looking for another place to go
3477287 our plant closed down at around the same time another guide plant closed in louisiana our work was relocated to monterrey mexico where they dont have to pay a living wage or follow environmental standards we lost our jobs because of unfair and unbalanced trade deals
3477288 presidential candidate obama will be able to take things in a different direction and get us on the right track hell be able to keep more jobs in the united states instead of giving tax breaks to companies that go overseas were hoping everyone will get out and participate in the labor walks and phone banks we need to get the word out on how senator obama can change this country and get the country on an upswing instead of the downswing its on right now
3477289 destroys the ability of unions to run effectively that translates into lower wages for everybody i know at my plant they are pitting us against a right to work state those people are getting a lot less pay than we are theyre forced to work long hours they have very little benefits if they werent a right to work state they would be making the same wages we are and the same benefits theyre making about 10 less an hour than we are
3477290 right to work is nothing more than a way to kill unions so were fighting for our survival if we go right to work in this state our members will be directly impacted when it comes to their ability to make a decent living with decent benefits and decent wages its a cause and effect thing if you look in the south where right to work laws are prevalent they make essentially less money than we do
3477291 they were retreating it wasnt panic but they were trying to leave one by one not in groups
3477292 we dont have anything we dont have food we left when the shelling started with very few things
3477293 we dont know whats going on and why the russians did this to us they said they were defending ossetians who are they defending here
3477294 if the russians say theyre defending the civilian population why dont they care about kodori gorge
3477295 they dont know where theyll go we have no idea theres so much confusion
3477296 the working men and women of the afl cio are united in our commitment to make jill long thompson our next governor along with dennie oxley she will work to bring real economic opportunity and good paying jobs to every community of this state and after four years of mitch daniels failed policies that will be a welcomed change
3477297 jill long thompson has always stood with working people and we are proud to stand with her now she has the experience to lead our state forward to grow the economy and to restore the promise indiana once held for our citizens we proudly endorse her candidacy and look forward to working alongside her over the next four years to put indiana back on track
3477298 dennie and i are honored to have the support of the members of the afl cio and its affiliates in this campaign
3477299 we are in this race to rebuild our economy and give working hoosiers across the state more economic opportunities
3477300 as indianas next governor and lieutenant governor we pledge to work with the men and women of the indiana afl cio to revamp our tax code invest in education attract new good paying jobs and protect the jobs we have here in indiana

3477322 these sterling achievements have overcome numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community to destabilise our peace and stability and thus cause confusion in our country
3477323 our members donate a lot of time and work to improving the quality of life not just for themselves but for their families their co workers their friends and neighbors
3477324 we really try to stay politically active to protect what we have and to ensure that we raise the level for all workers not just our union members but for everybody
3477325 there are a lot of issues were concerned with this election
3477326 the economy is falling apart with gas prices rising and homes foreclosures up the spike in costs in these other areas affects the ability for everyone to pay for health care costs which are also going up we are of course concerned about job security whether or not well have work and as a broader issue something that again affects all working people we really want to see everyone have the freedom to join a union without barriers from employers
3477327 we are adamant that we certainly want politicians that give us the right to form unions that let us keep our collective bargaining agreements in place and that knock down some of the barriers that prohibit other families and workers from forming unions when it comes to the employee free choice act the candidate has to be supportive thats why we support barack obama he definitely supports the employee free choice act and hell work with union members and all working people on the issues that affect us most
3477328 we dont presume to tell anybody how to vote but we believe if we give our members the information they need when it comes to issues that affect their work as well as information on the candidates theyll make the decision to protect their families and their livelihoods this year and vote for obama
3477329 were sending them information on obama through our newsletters and well actually go out there and talk and hand out information at the work site putting that information in their hands helps reinforce the communication

3477379 deeply concerned about high levels of drug trafficking human smuggling and gang activity
3477380 we have indicted 16 gang leaders and expect more arrests
3477381 to put it in perspective nine out of 10 countries have annual budgets that are less than this
3477382 the violence associated with drugs is legendary brutal and it is driven by greed
3477383 are not only poly drug but also poly crime and trans national
3477384 from deep inside my heart i want to return immediately to my own country with my grandchild
3477385 cheap mothers are available here there is so much poverty its employment for them
3477386 you have treated the surrogate mother like an object used her as a factory produced something given money for it
3477387 it is absolutely traumatic especially for the grandmother because they have a visa for a limited period of time
3477388 what happens if the period expires how do they manage the problem where do they leave the baby where does the baby stay who cares for the baby
3477389 i think obviously india owes an obligation to speed up the legal and judicial process so that the child is able to travel as soon as possible
3477390 i am very worried and stressed why cant they let her father take his child
3477391 i think this should end there should be stricter laws
3477392 half of the citizenship cases that they do now in mumbai are from surrogates
3477393 that is a total fabrication it would have been not only immoral but illegal
3477394 holbrooke strongly promised that the hague tribunal would be history for karadzic if he withdrew from politics forever
3477395 i am investigating the story of an agreement between karadzic and holbrooke
3477396 information about his whereabouts was abundant however it would always turn out that one of the three countries the u s britain or france would block arrests sometimes arrest operations were halted by chirac personally other times by clinton
3477397 personally witnessed a group of italian peacekeepers at a checkpoint literally turn their backs as a convoy carrying radovan karadzic came by with lights flashing just so they wouldnt encounter him
3477398 he was scared to death he was really sure they were coming to get him and was seriously looking to turn himself in
3477399 saying that he would turn himself in voluntarily but then he suddenly changed his mind
3477400 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
3477401 karadzic knows very well that he is in danger because if they find him he will not be transferred to the hague alive
3477402 told my mother in law that she would never see her son alive again and that they would kill him when they find him
3477403 i must say that this is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets that there is no death sentence here i wonder if his arm is long enough to reach me here
3477404 in order to verify my allegations i am presenting you a simple example which you can find in the attachment this document which i received on march 7 shows that on january 12th i e two months ago an extremely strong drug was found in my blood the fact that doctors needed 2 months to report to me cant have any other explanation than we are facing manipulation
3477405 mr milosevic was not told of the results until 3 march 2006 because of the difficult legal position in which dr falke found himself by virtue of the dutch legal provisions concerning medical confidentiality
3477406 and the gasoline for the crimes that we have will run out

3477408 build a tower with an armed guard every 100 yards
3477409 you see them with their ammunition belts and their ammunition boots you can see the dollies being rolled outside to their cars
3477410 why do they need the high powered guns because the mexican military is armed too and they need to pierce that armor
3477411 was going to somebody in mexico involved in some illegal activity drug trafficking alien smuggling perhaps or something else
3477412 a crook could care less how many laws you have
3477413 thats like holding a car manufacturer liable for traffic accidents

3477564 as tickets are really hard to get the fact that some of the best seats remained untaken through the whole game really upset people who really want to see the game but dont have the ticket
3477565 sponsors may give their tickets to their friends and important customers and they may not appreciate as much and come to the preliminaries
3477566 we are trying to persuade people to respect their rights to watch the games
3477567 that is why we come here to cheer both sides we are friendly chinese
3477568 i will feel regret if i have no chance to see even one game

3477576 i didnt mean it to be offensive to the larger group
3477577 when i used the term making tea i was not talking about any gender specific activity but it was a figurative thing meaning doing brian mulroneys bidding we know she was appointed to the senate by brian mulroney and is widely regarded as being his proxy in cabinet and those are the matters that i was referring to
3477578 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3477579 if liberal mps are allowed to publicly use offensive language like thibaults without consequence it shows that stephane dions commitment to women in politics rings hollow
3477580 many of them are worried about the kind of tone thats set where women are stereotyped
3477581 we had the situation of mr peter mackay saying that alexa mcdonough should go back to her knitting

3477604 the man who trades freedom for security does not deserve nor will he ever receive either
3477605 maybe shes creating too much expectation for herself and its putting a little too much pressure on her
3477606 if youre ranked 150 and you come up to 50 in the world that can sometimes happen you are not focused enough on what youre doing youre thinking too much ahead or in the past or whatever
3477607 they said youve got to focus on the task at hand and you cant let your mind drift that happens to the best athletes it happened to myself
3477608 sometimes you make unbelievable progress and you hit a point and say hey what have i done thats not unusual i feel for her that it happened in these matches but i dont think its a form slump

3477614 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3477615 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3477616 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3477617 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3477618 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3477619 i know what youre doing and you need to stop because its wrong
3477620 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3477621 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3477622 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3477623 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3477624 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3477625 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3477626 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3477627 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3477628 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty

3477696 whilst acknowledging the decision taken today by the commercial court of brussels lor al would like to express its utmost surprise at the result of this decision which dismissed the action from lanc me a subsidiary of the group against ebay for the sale of counterfeits on ebay platform
3477697 lor al believes the court to be mistaken in its decision to minimise the role of ebay in the sale of products on its platform
3477698 lor al believes that this judgement by the court digresses from the interpretation of the ecommerce directive provided in recent months by the european commission
3477699 todays interpretation also contradicts that of other european courts in particular the commercial court of paris in a recent case against ebay brought by other luxury brands

3477768 and they have been commanded no more than to worship allah offering him sincere devotion
3477769 actions are but by intentions and every man will have only what he intended so whoever emigrated for allah and his messenger then his emigration was for allah and his messenger and whoever emigrated to attain something of this world or to marry a woman then his emigration was for whatever reason he emigrated
3477770 the month of ramadan in which was revealed the quran a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion between right and wrong so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadan he must fast that month and whoever is ill or on a journey the same number of days which one did not fast must be made up from other days allah intends for you ease and he does not want to make things difficult for you he wants that you must complete the same number of days and that you must magnify allah for having guided you so that you may be grateful to him
3477771 as for him who is given his book in his right hand he shall surely receive an easy reckoning and he will return to his family rejoicing but as for him who is given his book behind his back he shall call for destruction on himself and will burn in a blazing fire
3477772 and the quran is a proof for you or against you
3477773 whoever reads a letter from the book of allah he will have a reward
3477774 the month of ramadan is the one in which the quran was sent down a guidance for mankind clear proofs for the guidance the criterion so whoever amongst you witnesses this month let him fast it
3477775 do they not then think deeply in the quran or are their hearts locked up from understanding
3477776 the first matter that the slave will be brought to account for on the day of judgment is the prayer if it is sound then the rest of his deeds will be sound and if it is bad then the rest of his deeds will be bad
3477777 when have finished performing the salah remember allah standing sitting and reclining but when you are free from danger perform the salah surely salah is enjoined on the believers at fixed times
3477778 the night prayer is offered as two rakat followed by two rakat and so on
3477779 the difference between our observance of the fast and that of the people of the book is eating of breakfast

3477794 google s acquisition of begun is likely to significantly alter the advertising channel allowing google to enhance monetisation of its already significant 35 share of the search market this will likely challenge the current dominance of yandex and although we continue to assume that yandex will maintain its leading position we believe that there is now debate as to whether russia will become a google country
3477795 although google does not disclose information about its russian operations industry sources estimate that it had approximately 5 revenue share in 2006 and 2007 implying a search monetisation 4 7 times lower than that of yandex this appears to be caused by google s inability thus far to adjust to peculiarities of the russian payment system i e cash direct money transfer etc rather than cheques as well as the lack of a direct sales force this weakness was the key underpinning and rationale for the begun transaction
3477796 overall rankings for the russian market have changed significantly over the past year with two social networking sites

3477842 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3477843 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3477844 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3477845 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3477846 identifying the normal cell that gives rise to a tumour is important because it allows direct comparisons between tumour cells and their normal counterparts so that key differences and vulnerabilities in tumour can be identified
3477847 also recent studies suggest that cells resembling the original cell may persist in mature tumours and can be critical in ensuring its survival if so these cells would be an excellent target for treatment
3477848 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour

3477859 the market is driven by anticipation of further fall in crude prices and may see a big rally if oil declines to 80 per barrel
3477860 i dont think there is a lot of upside because now the market capitalisation of the entire market is about rs 50 lakh crore it is much closer to a fair valuation if oil were to go significantly down to about usd 70 80 per barrel then we will have a huge rally if oil is headed for usd 80 per barrel we may see the sensex at 17 000 18 000 mark

3478040 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3478041 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3478042 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3478043 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3478044 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3478045 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3478046 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states

3478052 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3478053 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3478054 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3478055 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3478056 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3478057 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3478058 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3478059 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3478060 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises

3478062 they changed their strategy in the second set but we managed to counter that well
3478063 but we will need to raise the level in the next rounds
3478064 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3478065 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3478066 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3478067 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3478068 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3478069 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3478070 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3478071 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3478072 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3478073 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3478074 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3478075 we wont have any better chance than tomorrow to qualify for the asian cup
3478076 right now his achievement is unparalleled a spark that can start a bush fire
3478077 if he chooses dhoni then bindra can be assured of long term endorsement deals
3478078 abhinav bindra as a brand ambassador has iconic status with his achievements he has rewritten history which is unique
3478079 in india becoming a brand ambassador is all about popularity not brand fit so while sachin tendulkar could endorse brands even when the indian team wasnt doing well because he is the most popular cricketer around i doubt marketers would sign up bindra for long term endorsements solely on the basis of his olympic feat
3478080 theres a fair amount of competition with cricketers and movie stars since there has never been another option and even there marketers tend to play very safe
3478081 anirban blah ceo globosport a firm that handles brand endorsements for several sportspersons shares thomas reservation
3478082 it would take a lot of work and being in constant limelight for bindra to get long term endorsements
3478083 in the short term bindra should be getting four to five brand endorsements hes riding high on achievement and marketers would like to cash in
3478084 for me god is king woh agar madat karega mujhe koi nehi rok sakta i have beaten the athens olympics silver medallist earlier now is the time to beat a world champion

3478086 this is a huge win for humpback whales and all those who have worked for more than four decades to protect them
3478087 ending commercial whaling was one of the most important conservation victories of the 20th century today our planets great whales face more threats than ever including renewed whaling by japan iceland and norway it is our generations turn to keep these magnificent creatures off the target list forever
3478088 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3478089 fake singing for national honor what kind of lessons are we giving such a small child
3478090 most viewers thought these were live shots so our work achieved its effect
3478091 there are too many things to be taken care of its understandable that errors will occur
3478092 this scale of earthquake has not occurred before do we have to avoid it during the ceremony simply because we host the games
3478093 why cant we spend three minutes to mourn the victims in the ceremony
3478094 this kind of three dimensional performance is a first for the world
3478095 if london also wants to do it this way i estimate they wont surpass us in a short time
3478096 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3478097 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3478098 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3478099 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3478100 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3478101 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3478102 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3478103 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3478104 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3478105 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3478106 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3478107 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3478108 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3478109 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3478110 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3478111 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3478112 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3478113 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3478114 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change

3478117 the end i get eaten by the worms and weird fishes
3478118 im in the middle of your picture dying in the weeds
3478119 today has been the most perfect day ive ever seen
3478120 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3478121 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3478122 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3478123 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3478124 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3478125 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3478126 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3478127 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3478128 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3478129 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3478130 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3478131 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3478132 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3478133 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3478134 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3478135 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3478136 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3478137 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3478138 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3478139 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3478140 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3478141 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3478142 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3478143 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3478144 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3478145 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3478146 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3478147 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3478148 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3478149 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3478150 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3478151 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3478152 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3478153 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3478154 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3478155 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3478156 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3478157 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3478158 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3478159 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3478160 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3478161 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3478162 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3478163 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3478164 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3478165 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3478166 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3478167 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3478168 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3478169 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3478170 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3478171 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3478172 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3478173 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3478174 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3478175 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3478176 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3478177 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3478178 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3478179 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3478180 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3478181 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3478182 just so you all know we did set a record
3478183 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3478184 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3478185 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3478186 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3478187 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3478188 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3478189 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3478190 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3478191 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3478192 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3478193 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3478194 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3478195 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3478196 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3478197 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3478198 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3478199 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3478200 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3478201 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3478202 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3478203 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3478204 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3478205 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3478206 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3478207 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3478208 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3478209 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3478210 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3478211 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3478212 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3478213 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3478214 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3478215 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3478216 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3478217 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3478218 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3478219 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3478220 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3478221 there would be no market access for the developed countries unless this round makes healthy economies in the developing world
3478222 it wto is not about increasing the prosperity of the developed world but reducing the poverty of the developing countries
3478223 there are indications that fresh investment plans are also being reviewed by industry in view of the recent uncertainties especially on the oil price front
3478224 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3478225 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3478226 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3478227 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3478228 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3478229 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3478230 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3478231 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3478232 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3478233 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3478234 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3478235 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3478236 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3478237 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3478238 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3478239 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3478240 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3478241 star bazaars front end services and supply chain functions will imbibe the best practices followed by tesco
3478242 its very interesting tescos entry brings in a new dimension to the indian retail market
3478243 we will open the first store in mumbai towards the end of next year
3478244 the wholesale outlets which will be designed for the indian markets will sell fresh food grocery and non food products to small retailers
3478245 by 2016 we will have invested about rs 125 crore for this venture
3478246 the flagship stores of mumbai and delhi will have a size of 25 000 to 30 000 sq feet while regional stores will be of 10 000 to 15 000 sq feet
3478247 some dedicated staff within our stores will demonstrate how the toys work in order to give the consumers a better experience
3478248 our attrition levels have reduced from 13 9 last year to 13 6 this year as hiring has slowed down across laterals and people are watching a wait and watch strategy
3478249 the attrition rate at infosys bpo was about 35 per cent last year and has reduced to about 28 per cent this year
3478250 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3478251 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3478252 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3478253 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3478254 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3478255 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3478256 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3478257 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3478258 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3478259 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3478260 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3478261 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3478262 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3478263 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3478264 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3478265 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3478266 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3478267 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3478268 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3478269 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3478270 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3478271 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3478272 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3478273 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3478274 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3478275 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3478276 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3478277 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3478278 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3478279 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3478280 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3478281 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3478282 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3478283 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3478284 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3478285 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3478286 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3478287 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3478288 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3478289 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3478290 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3478291 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3478292 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3478293 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3478294 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3478295 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3478296 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3478297 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3478298 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3478299 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3478300 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3478301 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3478302 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3478303 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3478304 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3478305 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3478306 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3478307 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3478308 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3478309 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3478310 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3478311 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3478312 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3478313 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3478314 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3478315 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3478316 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3478317 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3478318 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3478319 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3478320 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3478321 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3478322 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3478323 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3478324 in order to guarantee yourself a specified minimum future income regardless of market swings if your contract is annuitized election in grip ii is irrevocable and a fee of 45 of the income base will be charged on each contract anniversary or upon full withdrawal
3478325 the grip ii benefit does not provide a cash value guarantee nor is it a guarantee of any investment option grip ii can only be converted to a lifetime income stream upon annutization on any contract anniversary after your earliest election date
3478326 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3478327 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3478328 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3478329 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3478330 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3478331 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3478332 integrations call me suspicious i just like an app to do what an app is supposed to do but anyway by hijacked do you mean you are going to an ad site instead of yahoo maybe that is even yahoo side behavior not ff but i just dont know
3478333 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3478334 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3478335 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3478336 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3478337 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3478338 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3478339 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3478340 has the fed done research that allows it to find the market rate of interest so that it doesnt make the cost of borrowing artificially too low or too high
3478341 is there any reason to believe that fed bureaucrats have the necessary information and ability to successfully fix the price of money ie interest rates in a 12 trillion economy of 350 million people when free markets are more successful at fixing market clearing prices for all other commodities
3478342 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3478343 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3478344 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3478345 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002
3478346 the gmo predictions are prescient enough to be a useful input into investment decisions
3478347 he is also bullish on emerging markets but feels that they are in bubble mode and will pop at some point in the unforseeable future

3478356 hey im gonna sit here and complain about my lovelife to a million strangers
3478357 isaac hayes helped pave the way for so many artists like myself
3478358 i also had the honor of meeting him several times he was always so sweet like an older uncle
3478359 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3478360 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3478361 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3478362 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3478363 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3478364 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3478365 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

3478370 blackwater founder mr erik prince has a remedy he believes that with 250 or so professionals blackwater can transform about a thousand of the african union soldiers into an elite and highly mobile force this force would also be equipped with helicopters and the kind of small planes that missionaries use in this part of the world it would be cheaper than the hundreds of millions we are spending to set up a larger au u n force and he says hed do it at cost

3478374 the impact of russian actions goes beyond their threat to democratic georgia mccain said
3478375 russia used violence against georgia to send a signal to any country that chooses to associate with the west
3478376 we must make clear to russian leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3478377 knows that the thoughts and prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle today for their freedom and independence he wanted me to say thank you to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people
3478378 the chinese fight when they are down and never give you anything so it was nice to turn the tables
3478379 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3478380 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3478381 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3478382 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3478383 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3478384 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3478385 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3478386 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3478387 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3478388 to develop an economic support package that will build on the resilience of the georgian economy and maintain stability
3478389 we are giving no details as we are working on it very quickly
3478390 there is a need for massive efforts by the international community to help the civilian victims of this conflict

3478395 casual games are becoming more complex and hardcore games are becoming more casual look at the wii i dont think its a casual platform because i dont think any proprietary dedicated gaming box can be casual but i do think it represents the casualization of the console gaming industry and as the casual player becomes more sophisticated more educated they demand more

3478401 since their formation the zimbabwe defence forces have remained steadfast in defending our national sovereignty territorial integrity and interests as well as our hard won independence

3478406 were trying to get an assessment of exactly what it means what a halt means and whether its taken place
3478407 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3478408 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3478409 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3478410 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3478411 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3478412 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3478413 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3478414 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3478415 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3478416 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3478417 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3478418 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3478419 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3478420 at the end of the trip we had about two hours free time on the rides before we had to play in the concert hall
3478421 it was good we saw mozarts trombone that he played the bell was really tiny

3478430 its unfathomable to me that we dont have a bipartisan investigative committee on contracting in iraq
3478431 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3478432 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3478433 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3478434 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3478443 i couldnt help but say to him just how easy his task and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from another species from another planet outside in the universe wed forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on the earth together
3478444 the soviets and the democracies will adopt the best characteristics of each other and in the process of many years there will not be a strict line of demarcation between their ideals therefore no causes for war between them because of the the developments of science all the countries on earth will have to unite to survive and make a common front against attack by people from other planets

3478463 i am anxious that we may be facing another situation where an innocent person is the victim of a violent crime
3478464 for the residents and neighbourhoods that comprise the manurewa community this prospect is doubly concerning
3478465 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk
3478466 by any measure the residents of weymouth constantly make every effort to ensure that their neighbourhood is safe
3478467 notwithstanding the worrying prospect of the outcome of last nights incident weymouth will remain a great place to live both now and in the future

3478479 a focus is being made to improve the socio economic imbalance within the province as the western part is mainly characterised by industrial activities compared to the eastern hub which is mostly rural and economically depressed

3478502 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
3478503 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid

3478507 our symbol o is about much more than barack obama
3478508 barack obama is a very exciting catalyst at first we were bothered by the negative and vulgar comments made when someone attacks something you hold dear it hurts but as we continued to read all the comments we realized just how silly and frankly unimaginative most of them were many didnt even take the time to read the article people came out against the peace emblem in the sixties making accusations that it was an anti christian symbol an inverted crucifix a satanic symbol and a communist sign

3478517 then fled into a neighboring compound where they held 11 non combatants hostage including several children and an infant
3478518 in light of statements from al qaeda and the islamic jihad union we are certain that a decision has been made to conduct attacks in germany
3478519 the president thanks you for your untiring fight your strong fight to restore constitutional order
3478520 we were not satisfied with the way he led the negotiations especially in the final stage
3478521 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3478529 senator mccain knows exactly how ralph reed helped jack abramoff defraud indian tribes out of tens of millions of dollars
3478530 senator mccain should spare himself any further embarrassment by canceling this event immediately whose help will he accept next tom delays
3478531 i suggest they take a closer look at barack obamas friends like convicted felon tony rezko or his national co chairman harry reid who took nearly 68 000 from abramoff
3478532 she had a huge gash in her arm that looked like a really deep wound that was bleeding profusely

3478546 and i would like the next president who will select justices for the next supreme court to agree

3478551 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3478552 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3478553 more sellers accepting a loss is actually a sign of optimism it means that the transactions might start happening there are so many sales contingent upon the buyer selling their home
3478554 ik beloof jullie dat ik ze zal blijven herinneren aan alles wat ze hebben gedaan en dat we op een dag zullen winnen
3478555 de russen zijn begonnen saakasjvili heeft een re el beeld gegeven van wat er is gebeurd hij is onze gekozen president we moeten hem nu steunen
3478556 want zuid osseti is ons grondgebied en rusland heeft daar niets te zoeken wij willen niet leven onder het monster poetin
3478557 saakasjvili moest kiezen tussen oorlog voeren of zuid osseti en abchazi definitief opgeven
3478558 de russen wachtten al jaren op een aanleiding om ons land binnen te vallen en die heeft saakasjvili ze gegeven
3478559 terwijl sommige politici nu roepen dat we de winnaar van deze oorlog zijn hebben we in feite de navo verloren de hereniging met zuid osseti en abchazi kunnen we de komende tien jaar wel vergeten
3478560 als een klein kind wilde hij zijn nieuwe wapens uitproberen
3478561 toen hij op de navo top in boekarest te horen kreeg dat een navo lidmaatschap er voorlopig niet inzat liep het uit de hand vanaf dat moment begon hij zijn oorlogsplan op te stellen want hereniging van georgi met zuid osseti en abchazi was een van de vereisten voor navo toetreding
3478562 als we nu vragen zouden stellen over wat er vorige week echt is gebeurd in zuid osseti worden we opnieuw van heulen met de vijand beschuldigd
3478563 het is een idiote situatie maar omdat het kremlin wil dat hij opstapt en rusland onze vijand is moeten we hem wel steunen maar lang kan die situatie niet duren want zolang saakasjvili president is blijft georgi problemen houden er breken dus kritieke dagen voor hem aan als de oppositiepartijen hem binnenkort met behulp van westerse druk niet tot aftreden kunnen dwingen zal poetin een vazal van het kremlin in het zadel helpen en dan is georgi nog verder van huis
3478564 er zat zeker een heel groot iemand achter dit drumstel alles staat te hoog
3478565 i think i love you but i dont know for sure i wanna kiss you but i dont know for sure
3478566 te veel mariah carey ik schreeuw maar wat ik hoef niet te laten horen hoe goed ik kan zingen
3478567 in refreinen doen we dat nu samen dat werkt goed
3478568 ik weet het nog niet ik hou ook van mode
3478569 ik wil eigenlijk iets anders gaan doen maar als we doorbreken vind ik het niet erg
3478570 dat hoeft niet per se als muzikant kan ook als mixer ofzo
3478571 soms maak ik iets mee en dan moet ik daar een liedje over maken
3478572 maar ik vind zelf ook dat de muzikanten toen echt vernieuwend waren en dat nu alles herhaald wordt de liedjes waren gewoon beter
3478573 ja dan denk ik meteen aan de red hot chili peppers en dat wil ik niet

3478575 how can god know does the most high have knowledge
3478576 lets face it were willing to make changes in our lives only if we think it affects our salvation this is why i have so many people ask me questions like can i divorce my wife and still go to heaven do i have to be baptized to be saved am i a christian even though im having sex with my girlfriend if i commit suicide can i still go to heaven if im ashamed to talk about christ is he really going to deny knowing me to me these questions are tragic because they reveal much about the state of our hearts and our question quickly becomes even more unthinkable can i go to heaven without truly and faithfully loving jesus
3478577 just to put into perspective the brevity of our lives throughout time somewhere between forty five billion and one hundred twenty five billion people have lived on this earth thats 125 000 000 000 in about fifty years give or take a couple of decades no one will remember you everyone you know will be dead certainly no one will care what job you had what car you drove what school you attended or what clothes you wore this can be terrifying or reassuring or maybe a mixture of both
3478578 the latter words of the teacher son of david king in jerusalem a man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work this too i see is from the hand of god for without him who can eat or find enjoyment
3478579 how do i live in such a way that when i am told that i have 30 days to live i wouldnt change a thing about my life
3478580 enoch walked with god then he was no more because god took him away
3478581 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
3478582 without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
3478583 you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart
3478584 i dont regret the decision at all because for me to truly understand what it means to be human which she argued is gods desire for all of us i have to encounter the range of experiences and emotions that are part of this life
3478585 how am i supposed to know what a good relationship is like if i havent ever experienced what a bad one looks like if you only eat filet mignon every day you will never really appreciate it because you dont have anything to compare to it like steak from applebees
3478586 to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil
3478587 did god really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden
3478588 we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden but god did say you must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden and you must not touch it or you will die
3478589 for god knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil
3478590 to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil

3478594 we just had too much information given to us about this incident to ignore it
3478595 we are concerned about the appearance this meeting gives to us as a newspaper to our readers and the citizens of lafayette county we would like an opinion on this matter from the ethics commission
3478596 oh well guess i get to go get new ones

3478607 the voiceengine takes a lot of the hard to manage components of voip processing the transmission and unpacking and wraps it up in one easy to implement package for our customers
3478608 what were providing our customers is a series of libraries and a high level api to access those libraries and integrate it into their application
3478609 theyll provide binary executable on the apple store for customers to download were really enablement technology so were providing these capabilities to our customers
3478610 weve already been contacted by a number of customers and theres a few uses we can perceive
3478611 one use for sure will be instant messaging applications adding the ability to have voice chat in addition to text chat as its currently available additionally we perceive the ability for gaming applications and for enhancements to social networking sites
3478612 we want to be part of that play as well
3478613 we are the hope of the future we are the ones weve been waiting for we are the change that we seek
3478614 the students involved become well acquainted with the preamble from this process this was a very moving experience for all the children really thought through what they value and how they want to see those values shared by others in the world this summoned respect and awe in the audience
3478615 when content is transmitted through song and movement it is much easier to remember making learning fun increases the childrens interest and thereby their capacity to learn
3478616 when i ask children what they most remember in previous school years they never say the homework or the written work they always say the performances productions puppet theater and we use the talking hands talking feet curriculum based performing arts program because we want a professional result
3478617 we have seen tremendous enthusiasm in children working with this approach they have a chance to make it their own to be it to live it rather than to just talk about it separate from themselves children want to engage in life and have a chance to put their own creativity in the process what we are doing is giving them confidence to create express and to learn in a deep and thorough way

3478621 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3478622 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road
3478623 live instructor led web based training is growing for a number of reasons
3478624 economic concerns and convenience are part of it but its also an effective way to get to a large audience in a short period of time
3478625 its not just that live online training saves travel time and costs
3478626 we think theres a big opportunity for resellers to add training to what they offer and become more valuable to their clients live online fits that model well
3478627 which helps build up their service margins and cement their role as a trusted solution provider with their customers
3478628 live online classes rate more highly with partners even than leader led and a fair number of people will use it because of its convenience
3478629 this year alone weve instructed over 1 000 students via this model

3478658 im probably getting in trouble for talking about bushs comments in a private meeting but that was his response and that was his charge
3478659 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3478660 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop
3478661 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3478662 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3478663 we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and will continue our discussions with all the parties involved
3478664 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3478665 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3478666 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop

3478668 a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department
3478669 where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3478670 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3478671 unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire them or to reassign them without individual cause
3478672 this is not protest against land transfer in fact this is anger against india
3478673 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3478674 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3478675 i expect this class to be one of the most difficult you have taken so far we will cover advanced high school level algebraic concepts some of which i expect even the most prodigious math student will have trouble with i give you fair warning i am tougher than most of your other teachers i grade harder assign more expect better welcome to eighth grade advanced algebra i wish you all luck

3478680 gaining momentum with soa initiatives involves working on the right one
3478681 if i have a small team of soa architects i need to recognize that i can only staff one project to really start to try out this technology
3478682 maybe they are not going down the path of full soa but they can still benefit from the aid you can give them in doing a functional analysis of business processes

3478687 forget the old rules i love white all year round its cooler to wear it when you arent supposed to
3478688 the idea of not wearing brown and black together seems so dated the other day i wore a black t shirt black nobody jeans a brown leopard print belt by dolce amp gabbana and brown giuseppe zanotti shoes and it looked awesome and i also love to mix prints
3478689 combine different materials in your accessories i wear a lot of different bangles gold silver wood acrylic its fun
3478690 i never do one designer all the way like an entire dolce amp gabbana outfit its not practical its more fun to mix your street wear with high fashion
3478691 just because a trend happens doesnt mean you should adopt it wear what best fits your shape
3478692 i learned at a young age that physicality isnt important it can be manipulated
3478693 i love blokes shirts i bought a plain white mens prada shirt in rome
3478694 some people think wearing powder ages them but try it anyway for me it mattes my makeup and blends it well
3478695 a woman should never wear anything she cannot lose why have jewelry in a safe stack it on and enjoy

3478706 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3478707 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3478708 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3478709 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation

3478721 the factory workers will probably have to strike or demonstrate before the government makes any of the promised changes

3478837 ibrahim hooper spokesman for the council on american islamic relations was on paula zahns cnn show tonight with dennis prager and christopher hitchens
3478838 appearing on fox news recently the spokesman for the council on american islamic relations cair ibrahim hooper said
3478839 how would you feel if your children came home from school and told you about this
3478840 fighting for freedom fighting for islam that is not suicide
3478841 the only specific accusation is that hlf funds feed the orphans of suicide bombers along with hundreds of other children
3478842 the most trusted and largest islamic charitable organization in the u s sends a wrong message to muslims all over the world basically that israel gets to dictate our foreign policy
3478843 really makes american muslims feel that they are not going to get a fair shake in the justice system
3478844 american muslims view yesterdays action as just one of a long list of attempts by the pro israel lobby to intimidate and silence all those who wish to see palestinian muslims and christians free themselves of a brutal apartheid like occupation
3478845 we believe the genesis of this raid lies not in washington but in tel aviv
3478846 a growing disparity and climate of injustice for muslims who we feel are being selectively prosecuted and given unfair sentences precisely because they are muslim or arab
3478847 this campaign has been orchestrated to serve as a wedge between america and islamic countries
3478848 his past speeches and participation in fund raising activities could be supportive of terrorist organizations
3478849 the whole muslim community today is under a microscope of scrutiny
3478850 these principles either reflect russias demands to the georgian leadership or its intentions concerning the pace and aims of its peacekeeping operation in south ossetia
3478851 so far this has only been fixed in an informal political form
3478852 it requires the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force this is a key point
3478853 this is an absolutely binding condition that the georgian side is to pull back its forces not only from south ossetia but also from other areas of georgia from which they can shell and bomb the region

3478876 that is not what i set out to do but i think the movie is good and it speaks for itself
3478877 the jokes are all in context of what some actors are willing to do to win an oscar
3478878 that is a longstanding joke in hollywood that certain types of roles like the one joked about in the film help put you in the minds and eyes of the academy voters and to what lengths some actors will go to bring one of those gold bad boys home

3478890 there is still some oil production from the caspian and it is being exported through two other routes one is a rail link from baku to batumi
3478891 and the other link one is another pipeline known as the northern route and that is operated by the azerbaijan national company socar from baku to novorossisk
3478892 what has been suspended as a precaution because of the problems in georgia is the production of gas into the pipeline at baku
3478893 but a gas pipeline is high pressure so you can still supply gas out the other end into turkey even though you are not pumping gas into it at baku and there is probably several days of supply still in turkey
3478894 although bp has halted oil shipments along smaller pipelines through georgia as a precaution the quantities of crude oil involved are relatively small and in any case may soon resume if moscows announcement this morning of a halt to military operations proves to be a step towards de escalation
3478895 that is not to say that there are no important ramifications for the oil market from recent events in the caucasus
3478896 in the context of falling non opec crude oil output from other parts of the world this extra oil is vital
3478897 what has been highlighted over the past few days is that despite the careful routing of pipelines to avoid both russia and the middle east it still comes with a very significant degree of political risk

3479005 additional oil production resulting from the opening of anwr would be only a small portion of total world oil production and would likely be offset in part by somewhat lower production outside the united states the opening of anwr is projected to have its largest oil price reduction impacts as follows a reduction in low sulfur light crude oil prices of 0 41 per barrel 2006 dollars in 2026 for the low oil resource case 0 75 per barrel in 2025 for the mean oil resource case and 1 44 per barrel in 2027 for the high oil resource case relative to the reference case

3479010 unfortunately it was at like 8 o clock so the girls were awake and they heard my wife screaming
3479011 we noticed lady spending an awful lot of time down by the pond in our backyard
3479012 then late one night after id put the dogs out lady wouldnt come in
3479013 she finally staggered over to me from the cattails she looked up at me leaned her head over and opened her mouth like she was going to throw up and out plopped this disgusting toad
3479014 we couldnt keep our dogs addiction a secret any longer
3479015 the neighbors all knew that lady was a drug addict and soon the other dogs werent allowed to play with her

3479028 a bunch of youth groups posted something that was almost a manifesto that called on supporter to wage an information war against georgia
3479029 in the ongoing russian versus georgia cyberwar we have an indication of lists of georgian governmental sites actively distributed across russian web forums
3479030 by posting on blogs and forums instructions that essentially say this is what were going to do but we dont know whos behind that
3479031 georgian hackers or pro georgian hackers launched distributed denial of service attacks against ria novosti
3479032 especially in russia every time something happens there are attacks name any crisis there in the past year and i can point to a spike in attack traffic
3479033 countries visionary enough in the long term sort of tolerate hacking activities unless of course they target the countrys infrastructure in order for the country to later on mobilize them based on nationalist sentiments
3479034 what the attackers learned is that security researchers are actively monitoring their conversations and so in the russo georgia campaign the conversation wasnt happening at the usual underground corners but rather on mainstream forums
3479035 theyve also learned how to better utilize the masses to participate in the attack and that combination of tactics would improve the quality of the campaign
3479036 anyone picking a political fight with russia today can now expect to deal with multiple forms and sources of electronic attack not only from the russian military but also from the russian governments unofficial civilian hacker assets

3479365 esta frase en el sentir de todos los autores griegos fue dicha por cristo para que no se asustasen los dem s ap stoles al o r la predicaci n hecha a pedro que le negar a y pensasen que ellos tambi n contra su voluntad ir an a traicionarle puesto que el jefe y m s valiente de todos ellos hab a de caer
3479366 es el propio leitmotiv de todo aquel discurso jes s exige a sus disc pulos que tengan tanta fe en l como la tienen en el padre que crean que l est en el padre y que el padre est en l
3479367 cristo les levanta ante su partida el optimismo que no haya turbaci n pues creeis en dios creed tambi n en m puesto que ya creen en dios que crean tambi n en l que esa fe en l se mantenga y aumente en su ausencia a pesar de que van a presenciar su muerte de cruz que crean en l como en el hijo de dios tema del evangelio de juan por eso parece que el primer verbo se tome en presente y el segundo en imperativo
3479368 la fe que ten is en m y en mi padre que me engendr es m s potente que todos los acontecimientos que sobrevengan ning n trabajo puede nada contra ella
3479369 l los consuela asegur ndoles que no por eso quedan excluidos aunque de momento no le sigan ya lo har n a su tiempo y no les faltar lugar all porque en casa de su padre esto es en su reino son muchas las mansiones y a cada cual se le guarda la suya sin peligro de que otro la ocupe
3479370 las muchas mansiones convienen con el nico denario que si bien unos m s que otros se alegrar n y regocijar n todos sin embargo gozar n en la fruici n nica de la visi n de su creador no sienten tampoco los efectos de esta desigualdad porque all cada cual recibe de gloria lo que le basta
3479371 y as dios ser todas las cosas para todos porque siendo dios la caridad se obrar por esta caridad que sea com n a todos el bien que uno posea de esta manera cada uno posee lo que l no tiene en tanto que lo ama en otro no habr pues envidia en la desigualdad de gloria porque reinar la unidad de amor
3479372 la ense anza no es que el cielo sea para unos pocos tiene una inmensa capacidad all caben todos la imagen probablemente tiene por base el plano del templo con sus m ltiples estancias y compartimentos y al que cristo un d a llam tambi n la casa de mi padre jn 2 16 precisamente l va al cielo como hijo a la casa de su padre
3479373 esto les hace ver ya la solicitud por ellos pues va a prepararles el lugar san agust n pensaba que esto lo hac a preparando aqu a los futuros moradores pero esta interpretaci n modifica sustancialmente la met fora la raz n de esta preparaci n es que nadie pod a ingresar en el cielo hasta que lo hiciese la humanidad de cristo resucitado ya que l es la primicia de toda la humanidad
3479374 pero cristo no s lo va a prepararles el lugar aunque directamente se dirige a ellos la doctrina es universal sino que despu s de dejar preparado el cielo a los hombres con su ingreso en el mismo anuncia su retorno para venir a llevarlos con l a su morada es lo que ped a al padre en su oraci n sacerdotal jn 17 24 a qu momento se refiere esta venida se ha propuesto al momento de la muerte a la parus a o sin precisar el momento se afirmar a s lo el hecho
3479375 no parece referirse al momento de la muerte es un tema no relatado con esta exclusiva y espec fica precisi n en los evangelios
3479376 adonde yo voy t no puedes seguirme ahora me seguir s m s tarde
3479377 una t cita queja y amorosa reprensi n por no haberles querido decir nunca abiertamente ad nde iba
3479378 los ap stoles aparecen con una rusticidad grande no comprendiendo como en otras ocasiones las ense anzas de cristo
3479379 basta con que esa verdad y esa vida sean las del mediador que las posee absolutamente tal como su padre
3479380 aquel que es el camino no puede llevarnos por lugares extraviados ni enga arnos con falsas apariencias el que es la verdad ni abandonarnos en el error de la muerte el que es la vida
3479381 como diciendo si conocieseis mi sustancia y dignidad conocer ais tambi n la de mi padre porque aunque lo conoc an no era como conven a hasta que despu s con la venida del esp ritu santo conoci ronle de una manera perfecta por esta causa contin a y desde ahora le conocer is se refiere a la cognici n intelectual y le hab is visto
3479382 la pregunta de felipe que pide les muestre al padre pensando que cristo que hizo tantos milagros se lo manifestase ahora con una maravillosa teofan a al estilo de lo que se pensaba de mois s o isa as que hab an visto a dios hace ver una vez m s la rudeza e incomprensi n de los ap stoles hasta la gran iluminaci n de pentecost s
3479383 de dos maneras pudo conocerse la divinidad de cristo por sus palabras y doctrina y por sus obras esto es por los milagros que hac a ambas cosas las ten a comunes con el padre porque el padre era el que hablaba por cristo como por su verbo y por l tambi n como por virtud y brazo suyo obraba y hac a milagros seg n leoncio y cirilo interpretan pues entonces c mo dice que no habla de s mismo agust n y beda piensan que cristo se expresa as no ya como hombre sino tambi n como dios y afirma que no habla de s mismo sino del padre el padre al comunicarle la naturaleza le da tambi n las palabras y las obras pero mejor entienden cirilo leoncio y teodoro de mopsuestia que habla el salvador como hombre cual si dijera aunque me veis hombre sin embargo las palabras que hablo y las obras que hago no son humanas sino divinas por ellas pues deber is conocer que soy algo m s que hombre y ver en m al padre
3479384 el padre que permanece en m es el que realiza las obras
3479385 de ese conocer al padre y al hijo se sigue que tambi n han de saber que est n el uno en el otro c mo podr a pensarse que por la uni n vital
3479386 por ltimo a las obras que el padre hace en l remite para la garant a de esta mutua presencia y de la verdad de que el que lo ve a l ve al padre
3479387 ya no vivo yo es cristo quien vive en m
3479388 que el siervo no se encumbre por encima del se or ni el disc pulo por encima del maestro dice que los disc pulos han
3479389 este es mi hijo muy amado en quien he puesto mi complacencia
3479390 a sta pertenece exaltar a los que se humillan por causa de dios seg n aquello lc 1 52 destron a los poderosos y ensalz a los humildes por eso ya que cristo a causa del amor y obediencia a dios se humill hasta la muerte de cruz era preciso que fuera ensalzado por dios hasta la resurrecci n gloriosa
3479391 los que pasaban por all le insultaban meneando la cabeza y diciendo t que destruyes el santuario y en tres d as lo levantas s lvate a ti mismo si eres hijo de dios y baja de la cruz
3479392 la muerte ha sido devorada en la victoria d nde est oh muerte tu victoria d nde est oh muerte tu aguij n
3479393 en su muerte muri nuestra muerte y en su gloriosa resurrecci n hemos resucitado todos
3479394 inmolado en la cruz venci a la muerte y una vez muerto vive para siempre
3479395 destruida la antigua situaci n de pecado en cristo se nos otorga la integridad de la vida
3479396 aniquilar mediante la muerte al se or de la muerte es decir al diablo
3479397 libertar a cuantos estaban de por vida sometidos a esclavitud
3479398 y como en ad n todos murieron as tambi n en cristo todos ser n vivificados
3479399 ha resucitado de entre los muertos como primicia de los que durmieron porque como por un hombre vino la muerte tambi n por un hombre vino la resurrecci n de los muertos
3479400 ahora es el juicio de este mundo ahora el pr ncipe de este mundo ser arrojado fuera
3479401 y despojando a principados y potestades los sac valientemente a la verg enza triunfando de ellos en la cruz
3479402 h c est dies quam fecit dominus exultemus et l temur in ea
3479403 si cristo no resucit vana es nuestra predicaci n y vana tambi n nuestra fe
3479404 a adid todas las solemnidades de los gentiles y no llegar is a nuestros cincuenta d as de la pascua
3479405 as pues si hab is resucitado con cristo buscad las cosas de arriba donde est cristo sentado a la diestra de dios aspirad a las cosas de arriba no a las de la tierra porque hab is muerto y vuestra vida est oculta con cristo en dios cuando aparezca cristo vida vuestra entonces tambi n vosotros aparecer is gloriosos con l
3479406 al ver resucitar a cristo que es nuestra cabeza esperamos que tambi n resucitaremos nosotros
3479407 dios le resucit al tercer d a y le concedi la gracia de aparecerse
3479408 no cabe duda que maria magdalena era la que m s fervientemente amaba al se or de entre todas las mujeres que lo hab an amado de modo que no sin raz n san juan hace s lo menci n de ella sin nombrar a las otras que con ella fueron como aseguran los otros evangelistas
3479409 con raz n se dice cuando a n era de noche porque en efecto mar a buscaba en el sepulcro al creador del universo que ella amaba y porque no le encontr le crey robado y por consiguiente encontr tinieblas cuando lleg al sepulcro
3479410 pedro y juan representan la autoridad y el amor la fuerza del gobierno y de la caridad la magdalena va a pedro y juan en la congoja que de ella se ha apoderado a la vista del sepulcro abierto a buscar direcci n y sost n es una mujer amant sima del se or pero se reconoce incapaz de juzgar y resolver el asunto grav simo que sus mismos ojos han planteado a su esp ritu por ello busca la luz del consejo y el amparo de la caridad en nuestras dudas sobre todo en lo que ata a a cosas de fe acudamos a los oficios de los que son de ella custodios natos y que por su jerarqu a ser n nuestros gu as y con entra as de amor sostendr n nuestro esp ritu
3479411 no priv a la mujer de esta gloria ni crey indecoroso que ambos ap stoles supieran por ella la primera noticia por su palabra van ellos con mucha solicitud a reconocer el sepulcro
3479412 esta descripci n tan detallada del evangelista no carece de misterio san juan el m s joven de los dos representa la sinagoga judaica y pedro el m s anciano la iglesia universal aunque la sinagoga de los jud os precedi en el culto divino sin embargo la multitud de los gentiles precede en el uso del siglo a la sinagoga de los jud os corrieron ambas juntamente porque desde su nacimiento hasta su ocaso aunque en distinto sentido corren juntas la sinagoga lleg primero al monumento pero no entr porque aunque entendi los mandatos de la ley sobre las profec as de la encarnaci n y pasi n y muerte del se or no quiso creer lleg despu s sim n pedro y entr en el sepulcro porque la iglesia de las naciones que sigui la ltima crey a cristo muerto en su humanidad y vivo en su divinidad el sudario pues de la cabeza del se or no fue encontrado con los lienzos porque dios es la cabeza de cristo y los misterios de su divinidad son incomprensibles a la flaqueza de nuestra inteligencia y superiores a las facultades de la naturaleza humana se ha dicho que el sudario se ha encontrado no s lo separado sino envuelto porque el lienzo que sirve de envoltura a la cabeza divina demuestra su grandeza en que no tiene principio ni fin sta es pues la raz n por qu se encontr solo en otro lugar porque dios no se encuentra entre las almas que est n divididas y s lo merecen recibir su gracia las que no viven separadas por el esc ndalo de las sectas pero como el lienzo que cubre la cabeza de los operarios sirve para enjugar el sudor puede entenderse con el nombre de sudario la obra de dios que aunque permanece tranquilo e inmutable en s mismo manifiesta que sufre y trabaja en la dura perversidad de los hombres el sudario que hab a estado sobre su cabeza y encontrado aparte demuestra que la pasi n de nuestro redentor es muy diversa de la nuestra porque l la padeci sin culpa y nosotros por nuestros pecados l se ofreci a ella voluntariamente y nosotros la sufrimos contra nuestra voluntad despu s que entr pedro entr juan porque al fin del mundo la judea entrar tambi n en la fe del salvador
3479413 esto era prueba de resurrecci n porque si alguno lo hubiera trasladado no hubiera desnudado su cuerpo ni si lo hubieran robado los ladrones no hubiesen cuidado de quitarle y envolver el sudario poni ndolo en un sitio diferente de los lienzos sino que hubieran tomado el cuerpo como se encontraba ya hab a dicho san juan que al sepultarle lo hab an ungido con mirra la cual pega los lienzos al cuerpo y no creas a los que dicen que fue robado pues no ser a tan insensato el ladr n que se ocupara tanto de cosa tan in til
3479414 admira en pedro la prontitud de la vida activa y en juan la contemplaci n humilde y pr ctica de las cosas divinas con frecuencia los contemplativos llegan por la humildad al conocimiento de las cosas divinas pero los activos guiados por su fervorosa asiduidad llegan primero al colmo de este conocimiento
3479415 la sagrada escritura es como una carta de dios dirigida a los hombres pero los hombres no pueden interpretarla por s solos necesitan ser conducidos por la iglesia que es el int rprete nato y autorizado de las divinas escrituras para lo que tiene la luz y la asistencia del esp ritu santo por esto dice lc 24 45 que jes s antes de subir a los cielos abri la inteligencia de sus ap stoles para que comprendiesen las escrituras no presumamos pues leer estas regalad simas cartas de dios sin el sentido de dios y sin la uni n con quienes tienen la autoridad de dios para interpretarlas ser a condenarnos a la ignorancia quiz s a groseros errores sobre su contenido ste es el secreto de las ca das de quienes interpretan las escrituras fuera de la iglesia cat lica
3479416 the net effect is that we are adding one more ball to the drums
3479417 with the addition of florida powerball has the chance to become even more exciting by keeping the jackpot levels up where players like to see them but we also want to do some special things with the game even though many players focus on large powerball jackpots we still want to create lots of millionaires and we also want to create more winners with better overall odds
3479418 the price of a powerball ticket remains unchanged at 1 even though our players know that the cost of everything else has gone up since powerball sales commenced over 16 years ago we didnt want to raise powerballs price in our current economy powerball players will continue to have the option to play the game for 1 or to play the game with enhanced prizes for 2 by using power play

3479532 they should focus on the crores spent on the big cars and the free alcohol instead of focussing on such a minor part of the election process
3479533 its okay on a compact campus like jnu but du spans all of delhi although we wont be using posters this time we have student units in each college to spread awareness about our party

3479542 the five star hotel is a perfect gift from a father to celebrate the heroic achievement of his son
3479543 as soon as we get approval other modalities would also be completed
3479544 abhinav and his father have special attachment for dehra dun they want to keep their memories alive through this five star hotel
3479545 breaking the stereotype that people have that all cops are bad by having police officers become responsible for their actions

3479550 i first picked this up in bits and pieces last week off daily rotation a more in depth story is available at zdnet which reports a weeks worth of speculations around russian internet forums have finally materialized into a coordinated cyber attack against georgias internet infrastructure the attacks have already managed to compromise several government web sites with continuing ddos attacks against numerous other georgian government sites prompting the government to switch to hosting locations to the us with georgias ministry of foreign affairs undertaking a desperate step in order to disseminate real time information by moving to a blogspot account there is a question whether the computer work is being done by the russian military or others zdnets story offers further analysis of the attacks themselves and their origins some pretty good reporting
3479551 the scoreline may suggest it otherwise but i think it was not that easy anyway im happy with the way we played but we need to raise our game in the next round
3479552 we played solid tennis and im really happy to start on the right note
3479553 we didnt need to recreate old magic it was always there we just needed to repeat it and we have to repeat it in every match

3479567 i f we insist on reading literally in 25 years nobody will read it any longer
3479568 a shocking film in many ways but its truth revolutionary and its as fresh as yesterday
3479569 pbs is knowingly choosing to insult and attack christianity by airing a program that declares the bible isnt true and a bunch of stories that never happened
3479570 and this film doesnt do it its designed for intelligent people who are willing to change their mind
3479571 you are in danger of losing the eternal salvation of your soul
3479572 of course this has to be done with an eye toward security
3479573 but that doesnt mean checkpoints at every turn its important that the office towers the retail the memorial and the performing arts center succeed
3479574 when i was 12 or 13 years old she had told me that in 18th century japan the geisha who were known for their beauty and their porcelain skin needed something to remove all the heavy make up they wore
3479575 at the time the make up contained lead which was very damaging to their skin
3479576 so they tried everything to take it off and nothing worked and then they tried the nightingale droppings and it not only worked but it left their skin smooth
3479577 when i explain to my customers they think i misspoke because of my accent
3479578 but after they understand many of them are willing to trust me and give it a try
3479579 she e mailed me some information i definitely needed to know more before i committed to the procedure
3479580 but then i thought about it and the japanese have been doing it for such a long time and the geishas have such beautiful skin even though they put such harsh chemicals on it
3479581 it doesnt feel as abrasive as some other facials and it smells organic
3479582 and it doesnt tingle or burn it just sort of stays there its a really simple calming facial
3479583 its a very emotional thing to have a person walk again when theyve been paralyzed
3479584 its very rare to make a full recovery because the spinal cord is a very sensitive part of our body and any injury to it is basically permanent i think hes a very lucky man

3479591 vmware has made this a high priority issue and has been working around the clock to resolve the problem
3479592 just got off the phone with tech support and theyve been inundated by calls about this very problem
3479593 been bashing my head on this last couple of hours
3479594 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3479595 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3479596 our argument is unless you give tamils a feeling they have the right to their own destiny in many matters you will not succeed the lttes capacity to carry out terrorist attacks is not diminished
3479597 the sri lankan army has made a lot of progress in the last few weeks
3479598 but even if they win the battle i am not sure they will win the war
3479599 i think they havent got the tamil population on their side i know the sri lankan government will be unhappy at this advice but that is the best advice they could get
3479600 it is with deep regret that we must announce that a soldier from 16 signal regiment has died and two more from the same regiment were wounded in a suicide attack on a vehicle patrol in kabul
3479601 the three british soldiers were evacuated to a military hospital where one of them sadly died from his wounds
3479602 in addition two isaf soldiers and eight civilians were wounded in this suicide attack that targeted an isaf convoy
3479603 in several areas mud and rocks from the mountains have buried entire villages
3479604 the search effort has been difficult because we dont have equipment and the digging has to be done manually
3479605 we are trying our best but we really think they have all died their bodies might be buried below the rubble and they could even have been swept away down the red river
3479606 unfortunately performance has not been acceptable to date unfortunately the responsibility rests both here in sudan and also with the united nations
3479607 but we have reasons to be encouraged and hopeful that the pace of the past will be reversed and we will see substantially more unamid peacekeepers here to help the people of darfur in the near future
3479608 well be very disappointed if the pace doesnt pick up substantially weve had specific plans shared with us both in new york and in darfur at unamid headquarters for that to take place
3479609 i think the developments in 2008 from a variety of sources have brought a new focus and attention and the united states is anxious to be supportive of progress where possible
3479610 but let me emphasise and this is terribly important if were going to get a sustainable peace in darfur in the end the sovereign state of sudan will have to address this issue
3479611 that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the
3479612 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
3479613 there is a powerful human impulse known as the rule of rescue to attempt to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
3479614 nice recognises that when it is making its decisions it should consider the needs of present and future patients of the nhs who are anonymous and who do not necessarily have people to argue their case on their behalf the institute has not therefore adopted an additional rule of rescue
3479615 we would be opposed to ignoring a rule of rescue when it introduces a degree of flexibility around extreme cases so what if you waste a few pounds if you are doing your best for humanity

3479625 in belltown people are under siege by drug addled panhandlers thugs who throw punches and rampant drug peddling a man whose job it is to bring convention dollars to seattle tells me he steers out of towners away from the heart of belltown
3479626 close down the clubs that attract the bridge and tunnel crowd and the problem will go away drugs have nothing to do with it the example you gave about the guy that fell down in front of the father and daughter is unfortunate but really how traumatizing will that experience be in the long run the dip sh t frat boy types that come from the burbs and try to start fights with people in belltown actually are dangerous

3479629 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from

3479637 with sweden were going to prepare the final two matches for the 2010 world cup qualifiers we mustnt think of what will happen afterwards of my role otherwise how can we prevent the players from thinking about it as well
3479638 everything i had been told about this fantastic club rangers has been true and last years uefa cup run is something i will never forget
3479639 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realize that
3479640 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this injury was especially disappointing for me considering it forced me to miss the british open and it comes in a ryder cup year
3479641 but taking proper care of it is my highest priority and im encouraged by dr weilands experience with this type of injury and his outlook towards my recovery and rehabilitation
3479642 the injury luke suffered is not all that uncommon for golfers and baseball players and im confident he will make a full recovery with the proper rehabilitation and training
3479643 what was this nonsense i heard yesterday someone said at a press conference that i never had a contract or something

3479657 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3479658 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3479659 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3479660 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3479661 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3479662 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3479663 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong

3479712 todays gas price decrease continues to see less of a decrease proportional to the drop in crude oil and nymex gasoline
3479713 the effect of a weakening canadian dollar accounts for some of this but the ability of toronto marketers to pad their wholesale margins have increased three cents per litre the past few weeks alone and the increase in retail margins by 1 5 cents explains the remainder
3479714 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3479715 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up
3479716 to this day it was the toughest loss i have ever experienced and tried to bounce back from

3479733 likely carcinogen nervous consumers have been questioning the wisdom of continuing to use the nonstick pans theyve long counted on in the kitchen
3479734 this is the second successful court ruling in a row for ebay both supporting our view that controlling prices and distribution reduces consumer choice the litigation of counterfeits against ebay has been exposed as merely a stalking horse ebay provides a vibrant and trusted marketplace that gives european consumers a good deal we work to tackle the menace of counterfeit through action and co operation with rights owners
3479735 whilst acknowledging the decision taken today by the commercial court of brussels lor al would like to express its utmost surprise at the result of this decision which dismissed the action from lanc me a subsidiary of the group against ebay for the sale of counterfeits on ebay platform lor al believes the court to be mistaken in its decision to minimise the role of ebay in the sale of products on its platform lor al believes that this judgement by the court digresses from the interpretation of the ecommerce directive provided in recent months by the european commission todays interpretation also contradicts that of other european courts in particular the commercial court of paris in a recent case against ebay brought by other luxury brands lor al intends to appeal this decision

3479739 de russen zijn begonnen saakasjvili heeft een re el beeld gegeven van wat er is gebeurd hij is onze gekozen president we moeten hem nu steunen
3479740 want zuid osseti is ons grondgebied en rusland heeft daar niets te zoeken wij willen niet leven onder het monster poetin
3479741 saakasjvili moest kiezen tussen oorlog voeren of zuid osseti en abchazi definitief opgeven
3479742 de russen wachtten al jaren op een aanleiding om ons land binnen te vallen en die heeft saakasjvili ze gegeven
3479743 terwijl sommige politici nu roepen dat we de winnaar van deze oorlog zijn hebben we in feite de navo verloren de hereniging met zuid osseti en abchazi kunnen we de komende tien jaar wel vergeten
3479744 als een klein kind wilde hij zijn nieuwe wapens uitproberen
3479745 toen hij op de navo top in boekarest te horen kreeg dat een navo lidmaatschap er voorlopig niet inzat liep het uit de hand vanaf dat moment begon hij zijn oorlogsplan op te stellen want hereniging van georgi met zuid osseti en abchazi was een van de vereisten voor navo toetreding
3479746 als we nu vragen zouden stellen over wat er vorige week echt is gebeurd in zuid osseti worden we opnieuw van heulen met de vijand beschuldigd
3479747 het is een idiote situatie maar omdat het kremlin wil dat hij opstapt en rusland onze vijand is moeten we hem wel steunen maar lang kan die situatie niet duren want zolang saakasjvili president is blijft georgi problemen houden er breken dus kritieke dagen voor hem aan als de oppositiepartijen hem binnenkort met behulp van westerse druk niet tot aftreden kunnen dwingen zal poetin een vazal van het kremlin in het zadel helpen en dan is georgi nog verder van huis

3479749 from the pulpit homophobia is preached by some arrogant religious leaders who think their beliefs are superior to our inborn and some would say god given nature
3479750 the bishop of motherwell addressed his flock and told them how appalled he was that i had received an honor and that 100 years ago i would have been imprisoned like oscar wilde he feels that the roman catholic church is beleaguered in some way

3479967 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
3479968 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information
3479969 nat rlich gibt es auch solche die einfach nur die musik h ren wir gehen aber gegen diejenigen vor die sich selbst verletzen umbringen und das auch noch bewerben
3479970 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3479971 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3479972 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3479973 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3479974 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3479975 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3479976 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3479977 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3479978 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3479979 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3479980 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3479981 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3479982 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3479983 i was with president bush when we received word that there was an impasse and his immediate response was
3479984 we found this meeting very positive and it allowed the families to ask questions which we answered
3479985 we reassured the family that we are taking this investigation seriously this inquiry will be handled with integrity impartiality and with rigour
3479986 the advantage of a public inquiry is that it will look for the motives that feed this hatred of the police system
3479987 the other advantage of a public inquiry is that we will be able to analyze the intervention methods of police
3479988 thats what they told me they said you dont have to come
3479989 it appears to be consistent with the indications that witnesses or proposed witnesses had given us when the clerks office had called around to them to determine their availability and willingness to appear
3479990 i have reviewed the list with the clerk with the various responses of the proposed witnesses there are three that i can see that specifically indicated that they were not going to attend that they were told not to attend
3479991 this is a serious matter it has to do with interfering with witnesses
3479992 im here to tell you that this chairman is running an illegal forum
3479993 this is a conspiracy to undermine the will of parliament
3479994 ultimately youre in contempt of parliament for deliberately undermining the will of parliament
3479995 this is getting to be like one of those hells angels trials where witnesses mysteriously disappear
3479996 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
