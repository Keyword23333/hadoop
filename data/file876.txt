8760000 we have cravings for sugar salts and fats because for 99 percent of human history we didnt have easy access to those things
8760001 today we have a far more empirical way of talking about human nature than through stories like the original sin
8760002 who is god is the universe god what is our purpose and meaning what is good and evil who determines our future the bible gives us very specific answers
8760003 i find it fascinating that we are descended from something like lucy
8760004 but im not sure i find it upsetting or comforting spiritually
8760005 can and should temper our judgments about our morality and immorality
8760006 i could never quite understand why i had behaved that way
8760007 i think the physical change in my body was so strong that it completely overpowered any moral teachings and religious beliefs i had
8760008 what my book attempts to do is give voice to the millions of people in the middle
8760009 i tell them that science and religion can be mutually enriching mutually enhancing and can in many ways spur each other to greatness
8760010 we do a lot of speaking a lot of programs
8760011 we have a dodge sprinter van and we live with people in their homes for a few days or a week or more we take over their guest bedrooms as our office and sleep in the van its our bedroom on wheels and we speak three or four times a week
8760012 for many evolution has never been interpreted in a meaningful way
8760013 it hasnt been interpreted in a sacred way the same facts can be interpreted in multiple ways and we offer an inspiring interpretation that is meaningful and builds and strengthens faith people come to accept it and not just the way they accept death and taxes they wholeheartedly embrace it
8760014 i never felt that the separation between religion and science is necessary
8760015 its always been such an automatic part of the discussion that these groups cant get together but his approach of evolution as theology puts a whole different twist on it makes it appealing to many different people
8760016 he describes god in a way that even an atheist can understand
8760017 maybe they wont embrace it but they wont go screaming and running away
8760018 what inspires them gets them so excited and gives them hope for their own lives and the future is a new way of understanding reality and their relationship to reality
8760019 it gives them hope to overcome the challenges in their lives and in their families it helps to reconcile head and heart faith and reason humanists and evangelicals can find enough common ground to have a discussion and for many people it gives them hope for our species and our world

8760027 gaining benefits requires solving a number of difficult scale out issues there is no one size fits all solution to database scale out you need to be able to flexibly combine and extend technologies to create workable solutions
8760028 for there to be increased adoption of open source databases at the enterprise application tier a number of factors need to be addressed
8760029 these include increased enterprise functionality improved service and support offering proof that performance fears are misplaced increased resistance traditional database software licensing and a move to web based architecture for internal applications
8760030 continuent tungsten is a very important database extension as it allows open source databases to support business critical solutions and provides a performance boost
8760031 tungsten enables customers to stay on oracle database without using costly enterprise licenses because tungsten can replicate from mysql to oracle and vice versa it opens new avenues for open source databases in the enterprise application mix
8760032 turning the tables the impact of open source on the enterprise database market
8760033 the numbers of the 1h results need to be understood in the light of the main changes eastpharma is going through 2008 is a year of fundamental change at eastpharma with higher costs resulting from the construction of new manufacturing units and increased marketing costs as we work towards making eastpharma into a leading branded generics company focussed on profitability and customer driven products the fall in sales is mainly due to an active policy of selling less to wholesalers as we seek to reduce the level of inventories held by wholesalers the gross profit margin was affected by the temporary costs of keeping employees on the payroll while we transition them to the new manufacturing units we are pleased to see that the construction of the new units is going to plan and in some cases is ahead of schedule key indicators of our strategy are being delivered such as increasing prescription driven sales selling higher marging products taking control of stock levels reducing the level of free goods and the integration of the roche acquisition
8760034 what if your son or daughter was in that girls place
8760035 they didnt come into the world they grew out of it
8760036 certainly anything that encourages more environmental responsibility is a good thing we do have the responsibility of assuring that the generation after us has an earth to live on and the generation after them
8760037 i think the time will come when this topic is big in the media and people cant avoid talking about it
8760038 discount our fundamental belief that god is the source of life
8760039 were always discovering things that previously we didnt have the equipment or knowledge to understand as a people of faith we always have the responsibility of learning and expanding our experiences
8760040 many religious people reject evolution because theyve been taught or told that its contradictory to their faith
8760041 for billions of years life has found ways of creating greater complexity and interdependence
8760042 those are mythic terms traditional poetic understandings that point to something thats true
8760043 i hold all these concepts all these doctrines to be true in a symbolic sense its not about whether someone chooses to believe in the literal miracles of the bible
8760044 whether one interprets the stories of jesus as complete fiction or myth it doesnt matter the person the character of jesus the christ is the authenticity trust and humility
8760045 id love to debate him but id be sorry to embarrass him in front of a large group of people
8760046 he should study creation science there is good evidence that the earth is less than 10 000 years old
8760047 the creation evolution debate relates to how powerful is god is god honest he said six days the context seems to say six days why cant it be six days
8760048 is basically to help people see that evolution and when i say evolution what im meaning is the history of the universe the history of cosmos earth life humanity so basically the entire history of the universe that our best science is giving us what 97 98 percent of the scientists of the world agree with how that can be understood in a god glorifying way that is a sacred way a meaningful way an inspiring way in a way that will motivate people to be of service in the world to add their creative energies toward creating a healthy world and to live lives of greater compassion love integrity commitment
8760049 to show people how a holy view of evolution can inspire people to give their lives in service to a healthy world and to do so with religious devotion
8760050 thank god for evolution how the marriage of science and religion will transform your life and our world
8760051 ive always thought there had to be a way for the two to not be fighting each other to be compatible

8760060 my children have not managed to grow out of their uniforms before they have worn them out or left them on the bus
8760061 the shopping experience is so much easier if you do it online buying trousers with an adjustable waistband so they fit
8760062 it is great news for parents that they can kit the kids out for school on a shoestring budget without worrying that their new uniform will be in tatters by the end of the first week
8760063 more expensive school clothes might well be more comfortable but that does not mean theyll be more durable
8760064 it is just another way of getting consumer loyalty from parents
8760065 one point is that bhp could benefit because its near term profits are likely to be stronger than rios which could work in bhps favour and create the impression that it is more successful
8760066 the markets going to move more into balance and that might take some of the present froth out of prices
8760067 i would also note that there are some other significant producers which are presently quite small but there is a lot of new investment going on so there are going to be in the next few years additional players
8760068 clearly at the moment and for the foreseeable future they wont be as big as bhp or rio but nonetheless over a period of time theyll be emerging as significant players

8760200 one can often be in doubt about the effect of a word or a phrase and one needs rules that one can rely on when instinct fails i think the following rules will cover most cases never use a metaphor simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print never use a long word where a short one will do if it is possible to cut a word out always cut it out never use the passive where you can use the active never use a foreign phrase a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday english equivalent break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous

8760202 it was difficult i wont tell you that its not because we had some doors shut in our face early
8760203 there were enough young people out there that when we sat down and told them what we expected this program to be and what the vision of this program was going to be that they were able to buy into this vision and they were able to see themselves
8760204 i think i was one of the later players to finally see the vision
8760205 i found it kind of hard to believe while being recruited in 2007 that a year from now that well be playing and i just see a patch of field and a track around it
8760206 i started looking into this conference and i started talking to coach steele and he described to me what the buildings are going to look like how its going to feel all the new incoming atmosphere
8760207 and he told me up front everybodys a freshman and everybodys going to be getting a fair shot and thats all i could ask for
8760208 at campbell steele told him you are kind of small but youre talented
8760209 it was a need to know more thing because the team was not playing for a year but at the same time if i went anywhere else im pretty sure i would have got redshirted and wouldnt play for a year anyway so thats what kind of equaled it out for me
8760210 weve all invested a lot of ourselves in this program
8760211 i have invested a lot of myself in this program in terms of building day by day of this program the small details that need to be taken care of to build a solid program that i felt would represent this university and stand the test of time
8760212 im going to obviously be nervous because we dont know yet where we are this will be the first litmus test of where we stand today because we can guess we can estimate
8760213 but we really dont know until after saturday what we have to do to move the program forward from the way that we handle it administratively as we get a large crowd here to the way we handle players on the football field to the way they handle things they dont know yet we all feel like were as absolutely prepared as we can be but we all have that nervousness and if you dont have that nervousness its time to stop playing the game
8760214 visual computing is transforming the videogame industry transforming the film industry and has all kinds of potential for how we view real time television
8760215 we solve some of the most challenging problems for more and more companies around the world let the era of visual computing begin
8760216 three d should be a new way for us to dream and design the future of our world
8760217 it will impact everything we do education science talking to each other of course games
8760218 when you fly the actual mission you feel like you are in a simulator
8760219 we really cant do our job without the good visual graphics that we get
8760220 it used to be about the computing part but the emphasis is shifting it is not so much about the computation but how it is presented and seen by people
8760221 they will be able to recreate scan data so fast you could see your own heart beating
8760222 this is being subsidized by all these kids out there playing games
8760223 these next two games are very important to help us position ourselves to advance to the final stage
8760224 with the win against guatemala we have put ourselves in a good situation at the start of the semifinal round i was very pleased with the way our team stuck together in a difficult environment we need to have that same type of effort in the matches against cuba and trinidad amp tobago
8760225 an almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is an issue that unites statists of all persuasions they seem to sense that gold and economic freedom are inseparable
8760226 under the gold standard a free banking system stands as the protector of an economys stability and balanced growth
8760227 the excess credit which the fed pumped into the economy spilled over into the stock market triggering a fantastic speculative boom
8760228 by 1929 the speculative imbalances had become overwhelming and unmanageable by the fed
8760229 in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation
8760230 a favorable moment to shut and bar the door against paper money
8760231 the necessary confidence between man and man on necessary confidence in public councils on the industry and morals of people and on the character of republican government
8760232 it seems the kafka industry doesnt want to know such things about its idol
8760233 which means academics being the gatekeepers of the artifacts that they dont want you the reader to know
8760234 gloomy stuff we anglo saxons received via post auschwitz french existentialists
8760235 wonderful black comedies written by a man soaked in the writings of his predecessors and of his own day
8760236 we went out of our way to do something totally different
8760237 each place will be known for different things the goal was to be completely different
8760238 for us this is just how we do it this is the way we operate
8760239 we consider ourselves to be very creative this one we tried to make harder to duplicate
8760240 and you cant stop me so nah nah nuh boo boo
8760241 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was eight years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
8760242 i was a child of privilege and i woke up to a world on fire
8760243 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8760244 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8760245 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8760246 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8760247 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8760248 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8760249 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8760250 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8760251 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8760252 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8760253 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8760254 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8760255 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8760256 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8760257 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8760258 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8760259 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8760260 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8760261 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8760262 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8760263 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8760264 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8760265 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8760266 im not giving a lesson on accountancy but you do write money off over the term of a contract
8760267 what we pay is in an investment during that period you have a player who is doing a job and in this industry you buy and sell players
8760268 the club is looking to make its mark in a wider area
8760269 signing a big name player would possibly help that and would help me
8760270 but it wont help the team if you just buy lads at the back end of their career just looking for a final payday
8760271 they wont get anywhere near my team if they are not capable of helping it
8760272 senador obama este um timo dia para a am rica

8760278 he finished at a high level last year and it looks like hes already beyond that level he had an awesome summer and its looking right now like he can have a season comparable to any of those who preceded him
8760279 surely this is not a work of art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people

8760299 as a carbohydrate and sugar rich diet has become more pervasive in modern societies over the past 20 to 30 years it has placed a strain on peoples bodies that is leading to premature cell deterioration
8760300 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
8760301 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
8760302 this process causes the neurons to degenerate over time affecting our judgment as to when our hunger is satisfied

8760304 this study revealed a consistent 20 percent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
8760305 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by cesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
8760306 not all women have the choice of whether to have a cesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
8760307 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk northern ireland would welcome more research in this area
8760308 s lla er till hillary chelsea och mig f r att se till att barack obama blir n ste president
8760309 we live and breathe diabetes in our house so creating and providing our services to other families has really been rewarding
8760310 the people we have met and the friends we have made have been wonderful
8760311 the light bulb moment came to me after one of many complaints from my daughter about not having a happy bag to hold her medication and supplies
8760312 knowing the good that will come to people like my daughter makes it all worthwhile
8760313 because she didnt like them and the metal tarnished on her skin
8760314 we know that many people dont like the traditional forms of id and so our wristbands dog tags circle pendants and key chains zipper pulls are a great alternative
8760315 i love to see the proud faces i see in my children because we have managed to make something positive out of such a negative they love feeling a part of a bigger diabetic community that has banded together
8760316 our ids are meant to be durable comfortable fashionable and reasonably priced while still serving their main objective

8760342 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains geography at a stroke by not including them on maps
8760343 were in danger of losing what makes maps unique giving us a feel for a place
8760344 this is tragic they call this a map but it is so inadequate it has not been interpreted in any way it has no landmarks on it
8760345 the public need to know that what theyre getting on google is not accurate and isnt up to date

8760349 these types of trailers theres a chute underneath it comes into a hopper and at the base of the hopper theres a sliding trap door that opens to unload these trailers so they unload very rapidly
8760350 these young children cant foresee danger the way we see it its the responsibility of the parents to make sure their children arent exposed to dangerous situations that occur on a farm on a daily basis

8760363 russia was dragged into the fray by the recklessness of the georgian president mikhail saakashvili he would not have dared to attack without outside support
8760364 what is clear is that the western assistance in training georgian troops and massive shipments of arms had been pushing the region toward war rather than peace
8760365 i suggest one thing that should definitely be reconsidered the habit of talking to russia in a condescending way without regard for its positions and interests
8760366 turn that bloody noise off its doing my head in

8760383 got your coffee i need you to look at these for me when youve got a minute
8760384 good coffee ill have to thank greg on the way out
8760385 im so glad we have the house to ourselves next week
8760386 mum dad and tony are going to spain with friends
8760387 mickey and jake are going to germany to sort out some problems there and give a helping hand to torchwood 6 ive given the staff a weeks leave told them we can fend for ourselves for 7 days
8760388 you know those tests we did well take a look at the results
8760389 so sometime in the future we could you know have a baby
8760390 two days and we dont have to sneak around for a week i got some supplies earlier as well the lady in the chemist asked me if i was hoping to get lucky
8760391 as many packets of condoms as i could without too many eyebrows being raised
8760392 and 3 packets of aa batteries we need some new ones for tonys toy car oh by the way mum dad and tony are leaving sunday evening at four ish she said it would be better if tony slept on the plane jake and mickey leave at eleven ish ive checked all their flights and made sure they run on time from about half nine sunday night no more hiding for at least five days
8760393 if it had been it wouldve been one of my prettier bras so youll have to wait until sunday night
8760394 still on the tail end of my thing be gone by saturday so were in luck everythings going our way
8760395 go to the mansion early if you want to the pool should be clean by now if not someones going to be in trouble with pete ill see you later gorgeous
8760396 please be so kind to demonstrate what you think the movement of a capsule charged with temporal energy though the vortex would look like a few explanations would be nice as well just so well be able to understand the process
8760397 well first of all the temporal energies would need to be channelled by the coronal field matrix and turned back to the source of
8760398 the energies are fed back to the source before they are send outside to react with the currents of the vortex the fields collide and the potential power can be used to its full extent
8760399 we all know that this young man has a tasteless sense of humour but he must be a fool to believe he can confuse us by entering the right data while speaking of the wrong one they method he described cant work
8760400 if he entered the data we always work with why does the vortex move much faster than usual in the projection
8760401 now can anyone tell me why the process described by young theta cant work
8760402 the energies would get into a feedback loop and tear apart the time capsule
8760403 as anyone whos studied the documents of our ancestors should know
8760404 i read that textbook actually and i thought there was something funny about the results of the calculations given there because they indicate that there would be a direct connection between the distance both local and temporal travelled in the vortex and the subjective time needed to go there that is not the case as anyone whos living on gallifrey should know and so i had a closer look at the given data checking the calculations i found out that there is an error in the one predicting the time capsules destruction
8760405 who are you to claim that you a less than average pupil have found an error all the high lords have missed in thousands of years why do you think you know more than we do
8760406 because all the books just copy the data given in one old document and everyone has always assumed that it has to be correct no one ever questions anything left to us by our ancestors its too much effort to think for yourself i guess thats why this civilisation has failed to make any progress for a thousand generations
8760407 how dare you you will not attend this class again until you have learned humility and the respect to your elders you are so desperately lacking after this class you will come to my office now remove yourself from my sight
8760408 it makes me think you do not really want to convince me to let you pass my class
8760409 you cant let me fail if my results are good
8760410 experience shows that good results are not something you could give me and even if you would results can be manipulated now take of your clothes all of them

8760437 im fascinated by organisations the way in which people relate to each other at work
8760438 of course it has been tremendously helpful to have had a bureaucratic life apart from the writing i dont think im the kind of writer who would do well sitting in a country cottage frankly
8760439 i long to question them about how their day is organised how they make their money what are the problems and so on
8760440 i was extraordinarily lucky with health i really didnt feel particularly old we dont grow gradually into old age throughout our lives were on a plateau and then suddenly whoosh were five years older and then were on a plateau again
8760441 suddenly i realised that i was old and this was a condition that couldnt be cured but had to be lived with
8760442 ive never known the last part of a book go so easily
8760443 i cant write about these people unless i know theyre in a viable world
8760444 it is such a beautiful county but i think its one in which horrific legends abound
8760445 i think there are strong psychological reasons why this one appeals to me the bringing of order out of disorder
8760446 to be born in 1920 was to grow up in an atmosphere of national grieving the shadow of all that loss almost the wiping out of a very talented generation hung over everyone i think it made pessimists of us and then there was the unemployment
8760447 one grew up with a great sense that life was basically insecure
8760448 largely because of this insecurity about work and income in my childhood and having the children to support i felt that i needed to have that cheque coming in regularly at the end of each month
8760449 in life there is always some disorder left absolutely murder is a contaminating crime every single person who comes in touch with it is changed for good or ill
8760450 a very maverick christian some people would say i dont really qualify
8760451 if i were god forbid the archbishop of canterbury i think my attitude would be that there is nothing in the gospels which says anything about homosexuality and this is therefore a matter between peoples private conscience and their god but what is important is fidelity and kindness whatever the relationship is
8760452 i moved to the losing side which rather accords with my character and if i have a political principle it is in the freedom of the individual and the lessening of the power of any large organisation including the state of course
8760453 you cant work always looking over your shoulder terrified that what youre doing is wrong or illegal
8760454 this is going to be a matter of what happens to my heart and how long its going to go on beating for me i hope for some considerable time
8760455 to live under the continual fear of death is to diminish the quality of life that you have

8760457 yo pensar a que una vez que se resuelva esta crisis si estar amos creciendo en cifras por arriba del cuatro por ciento

8760466 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene
8760467 se est trabajando con la canciller a se ha estado trabajando en una especie de acuerdo con el gobierno paname o
8760468 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8760469 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8760470 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8760471 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8760472 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8760473 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8760474 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8760475 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8760476 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8760477 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8760485 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
8760486 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
8760487 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
8760488 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8760489 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8760527 por m s que estos genocidas lloren todos sabemos que son l grimas de cocodrilo
8760528 lamentablemente este hombre va a seguir en prisi n domiciliaria pero le falta afrontar como 500 juicios y la esperanza es lo ltimo que se pierde
8760529 una condena a cadena perpetua firme en c rcel com n y sin ning n privilegio
8760530 el simbolismo que representa la condena a estos personajes es un alivio y un ejemplo de lucha perseverante por los derechos humanos que est librando la argentina

8760537 pero juan carlos no le hizo caso y sali rumbo al micro con los chicos entonces este hombre lo invit a pelear en una placita que hab a enfrente como l no le hizo caso llam a un grupo de no menos de 25 chicos de las inferiores del club local que estaban all munidos de ca os palos y cadenas quienes lo encerraron en una calle lateral estrecha y empezaron a golpearlo
8760538 yo me qued paralizada porque los pibes que no ten an m s de 14 o 15 a os le pegaban brutalmente a mi esposo mientras este hombre los arengaba en un momento pens que lo mataban porque la gente de rivadavia que hab a acompa ado a los equipos tard en darse cuenta de la situaci n e intervenir

8760566 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8760567 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

8760576 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8760577 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

8760588 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8760589 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8760590 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8760591 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8760596 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8760597 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8760598 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8760599 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8760600 for many people this is an extremely important issue particularly young families with young children
8760601 weve had a lot of eye opening testimony and i think even beyond any changes that might be needed in terms of laws there are going to be some immediate changes in policies in practices at various state agencies as a result of this investigation
8760602 the victim in vermont is being kicked on the side of the road like a dead animal
8760603 i feel that jessicas law should be passed because it would make us children feel safer in our community
8760604 it seems to me that sex offenders have more rights than we do why are we not being protected why not pass this law so we can be protected
8760605 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8760610 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8760611 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
8760612 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
8760613 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
8760614 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8760615 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8760616 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8760617 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8760618 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8760619 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
8760620 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
8760621 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
8760622 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8760623 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8760624 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8760625 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8760626 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8760627 one of the great joys of walking this long stretch of my path here in the bay area is that it gifted me with you companions along the way hundreds of people who share my deep love and compassion for poor people my passion for justice for and recognition of the dignity of our sisters and brothers so desperately poor that their only home is the harsh streets of our cities
8760628 for the last 15 years you and i have walked this path
8760629 i have given myself heart and soul to this journey with you
8760630 i now find myself burned out simply with no energy left to continue
8760631 some folks had mentioned uh that uh were inquiring if sjc was a sanctuary and uh having uh been born and raised here i can tell you it is a sanctuary its a sanctuary for the young men and women who are members of the boys and girls club its a sanctuary to our senior citizens who meet at the community center its a sanctuary for the many private and public schools all the students that meet for counseling and so on and so forth it also is a sanctuary for places of worship here in the valley so you have it on record this place is a sanctuary as i listed
8760632 she said she was always scared of her dad she was always scared of her brother and shes not scared of nobody
8760633 when it comes to dealing with a war between israel and a terrorist organization this country and this government cannot and will never be neutral
8760634 those who seek to destroy the jews who seek to destroy israel will ultimately seek to destroy us all it is why canadas new government has reacted with speed and spoken with clarity on the recent events in the middle east
8760635 i wont say it was an easy round to pick because it never is
8760636 but with 13 winners we had to settle on the winner by a draw from a hat
8760637 it was ted greens lucky day because he was the winner he takes home a 40 meat tray courtesy of butch and the team at the south bathurst butchery
8760638 four of the tipsters in the western advocate footy tipping competition for local businesses also tipped the perfect round
8760639 you cant let the heart rule the head so i took the raiders
8760640 the only other doubtful game was the sharks and the roosters the rest were pretty easy so long as you went with the form
8760641 however i think its too late to change the result as jane stephens from jane stephens physiotherapy centre has it sewn up
8760642 we certainly encourage their participation its beneficial for both candidates and the community it gives people the chance to meet candidates and ask any questions they may want answered
8760643 our surveys show the people really love the idea of having a cafe incorporated into the development
8760644 they also want a playground so their grandchildren can have somewhere to play when they come to visit
8760645 the orphanage was supposed to be a better place but it turned into a nightmare a nightmare i havent woken up from
8760646 its like somebodys taken a picture of all the bad things and every time i close my eyes i see them
8760647 there were some good times but i cant remember them without thinking about being molested
8760648 these men that came forward i pat them on the back
8760649 it would have taken such courage how could i stay quiet when they have been so brave
8760650 we werent drugged or nothing who were we going to tell we were orphan kids we had nobody
8760651 wed try and convince ourselves to squeal on him but we were scared
8760652 i started wetting the bed so six months later i told them what was happening i got a hiding and was locked in the broom closet under the stairs they said i was a dirty girl for saying such things and washed my mouth out with soap i learned not to talk about it
8760653 i was very naughty because i wanted someone to notice
8760654 i understand why people kill themselves after something like this you dont know how many times ive thought about it
8760655 i carry that stench on my back ever since the day it happened
8760656 i was a day boy and i was not the only victim back then
8760657 it still doesnt take away the unfortunate reality of human nature
8760658 there are people who sometimes have sicknesses in psycho sexual arenas and that happens whether theyre priests or lay people
8760659 it was a giant anti climax we wont be voting on it until parliament resumes
8760660 i guess the premiers decision was to postpone in order to avoid defeat
8760661 its difficult to see where this will go but i dont think i can see it getting through
8760662 governments only get one opportunity to sell a public asset and if they decide to sell its essential that taxpayers get the best possible price
8760663 thats not possible given the current uncertainty in the energy sector
8760664 in particular the strength friendship and assistance provided by my estranged husband dale continues to be invaluable despite the tremendous pressures that he is under
8760665 together with the excellent medical care i am receiving i have also appreciated the fantastic support from my amazing group of close friends and staff members
8760666 no queremos que bussi sufra pero que no tenga privilegios

8760670 vivimos un d a hist rico porque se termina con la impunidad
8760671 este es un d a hist rico porque la misma democracia que le permiti a bussi ser gobernador ahora va a permitir que est preso

8760677 he never admitted he did anything wrong but he left town for ocala
8760678 fort lauderdale was absolutely different then we used to say that if a fort lauderdale lawyer gave you his word all you needed was a handshake but if it comes from somebody from miami you have to get it in writing
8760679 druck took advantage of richard and got richards share of the building
8760680 and druck if you had to pick a word was amoral he didnt have professional standards i flat didnt like him
8760681 was he absolutely faithful to his wife no but that didnt put him in a small category at the time
8760682 that was the morality of the time and of the fort lauderdale community
8760683 dad came into my room one night i was like uh oh not this again he buried his face in my shoulder his cheek was wet and he smelled of booze im sorry about dangerous dan he said tell me you forgive me he muttered something about the business
8760684 an underlying shift is occurring in american attitudes regarding the international role and priorities of the united states voters across the party spectrum understand that americas reputation has faltered and believe this is a problem for the nation that needs attention and repair

8760703 i dont want any family to go through what i went through
8760704 we have chased hundreds of leads across the country and we are not closer today than we were in 2005

8760790 fiscal 2008 was a remarkable year with record performance and outstanding growth
8760791 the merger between sims group and metal management which closed on 14 march 2008 was the obvious highlight but a further eight acquisitions were completed during the year across all regions in both metal recycling and e recycling
8760792 this outstanding performance could not have been accomplished without the efforts of our over 7 500 hard working company and affiliate employees who performed exceptionally with tremendous focus it takes extraordinary people to capitalise on extraordinary opportunities and we look forward to the future with great optimism
8760793 the operating results from north america for the year were outstanding and mainly reflect an extremely strong ferrous performance from virtually all business units across the region particularly in the fourth quarter
8760794 we reiterate our confidence in capturing at least us 35 million in synergy benefits for the full year ending 30 june 2009
8760795 we are particularly pleased with how quickly our north american employees have embraced the new one company culture
8760796 in fiscal 2009 we will enjoy the benefit of a full year contribution from the former metal management business supplemented by synergies we also have an extensive capital expenditure program targeted to capturing yet further non ferrous recoveries from our shredding operations in addition we will continue to evaluate growth opportunities where the targets satisfy our stringent acquisition criteria
8760797 our australian business has again performed admirably consolidating its position as the leading recycler in the country
8760798 the divestment of non core assets in australia will enable management to focus on our core metal recycling business and the commercial and technological opportunities available to us
8760799 the second half of the year saw our european metal recycling operations take full advantage of the favourable ferrous market conditions to record an exceptional result year on year ferrous intake grew impressively by 16 and non ferrous volumes more so by 34 recycling solutions continued to grow with european ebit up by 17 6 in australian dollar terms on the previous year
8760800 srs growth continues to exceed our internal target of 25 per annum the opportunities to develop this business are enormous organically through industry consolidation and also through internal leveraging with our metal recycling businesses for the year the divisions ebit contribution to the enlarged company represented 13 1 of group ebit
8760801 if sims is to be a truly world class company we must ensure that our health and safety culture and practices are enhanced with the goal of achieving worlds best practice the dupont review is the first step in that journey
8760802 the new sims metal management brand represents the merging of two industry leaders with common cultures and common visions for the future
8760803 for those who may have forgotten volatility extreme at times has been a hallmark of the commodity markets over the past few years as a global market leader we embrace volatility as it offers opportunities both in our day to day trading and provides us the opportunity to show our true talent
8760804 as we look ahead into the first quarter of fy09 despite a much tougher ferrous trading climate we anticipate a strong result albeit one not as strong as the fourth quarter of fy08
8760805 all regions will continue to respond to the recent significant decline in global ferrous prices by reducing buy prices in order to maintain margin to the greatest extent possible the degree to which these efforts are successful will to a large extent determine the outlook for earnings into the second quarter a further update will be given when the results for the first quarter are announced in late october 2008

8760840 current tensions put turkey in a very tight spot because it is under pressure from russia and its western allies
8760841 turkey is again in a frontline state like in the cold war but the difference now is that its dependency on russia is much bigger
8760842 turkey must act like a nato member if it wants its place in trans atlantic relations it became a member years ago and that means turkey has to support the steps that nato takes
8760843 on the pipeline there may arise technical problems which means we have real problems that means for the industry for consumers your economy will be harmed
8760844 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect
8760845 i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8760846 barack obama is ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states president of the united states
8760847 i know you hear that phrase a lot in politics i mean it
8760848 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8760849 and president clinton reminded us of what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first thank you
8760850 you all sit down we have to get on with the show
8760851 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8760852 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8760853 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america

8760861 hi i dont drink and dont know what to order
8760862 i have a moderately high income but am stayi ng true to my roots and not becoming a yuppie san franciscan
8760863 i love this shop i stumbled across it while visiting love at first bite its in the same shopping complex and was in complete shock and awe to see their letterpress machine at work in the shop window the shop itself is not very large but it stocks a number of their own gorgeous letterpress creations as well as cards and wrapping paper from other smaller stationery makers plus pens watches purses other things that youd normally find in a stationery shop the stationery is not your typical hallmark affair by and large everything has true aesthetic appeal which means youll be paying a little more as well definitely stop in the shop owners are quite friendly and nice too
8760864 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8760865 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8760866 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8760867 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8760868 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8760869 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8760870 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8760871 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8760872 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8760873 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8760874 its a big step to actually put it out there
8760875 i remember what roberto de vicenzo once said to me
8760876 if you shoot under 70 everybody will understand you if you dont they wont want to talk to you anyway
8760877 if we continue to follow this slippery oil slicked downward winding path our citizens will shiver in darkness as our resources hemorrhage to third world thugs whose only virtue is their control of petroleum based energy
8760878 the issue of the illegal latakia famagusta ferry link was discussed
8760879 g lers tehran visit that was expected to take place this week will not happen the agreement with iran was expected during this postponed visit but the expected progress couldnt be maintained however talks with iran are still ongoing a delegation from the turkish petroleum corporation tpao is still holding talks in iran
8760880 on this issue steps that must be taken by the iranian side are awaited iran has given a signal of softening and change concerning its attitude in regards to the buy back model that constitutes a problem for turkey in this situation an agreement can be signed in september
8760881 i havent seen anything that comes close to the horrendous facts that were presented in this case
8760882 the real reason behind calling me to testify as part of the ergenekon operation is to force my husband to leave his post it will be the first time i will give a deposition i am obliged to defend myself though there is no reason to do so
8760883 my lawyer has prohibited me from talking to the press i will not make any comment about the issue if you want to receive information about my testimony you may contact my lawyer he will inform you
8760884 throughout history turkey has been in the center of regions of crisis and this will not change failing to see or understand threats or failing to produce solutions to avert them is not sufficient to keep a country away from threats in consideration of this we can say that turkey is surrounded by a series of threats from symmetric ones to asymmetric ones
8760885 the fact that intellectual debates on the subject of the nation state can be made within the state does not mean opening to debate elements that keep the country standing
8760886 this movement targets the structure of the nation state this should be clearly understood by all
8760887 these concerns should be taken into consideration the fact that religious values are being given heed in our social life today fuels these concerns
8760888 today it is necessary to be careful about ethnic nationalism and reactionaryism
8760889 the lawyers are proving how organized they are that they have total consensus and this protest will continue until the chief justice is restored
8760890 it is not difficult to pick hazelnuts what is difficult is to remain standing on the steep terrain being out of money is more difficult though i thank prime minister recep tayyip erdo an for his help but we expect help in getting work permits
8760891 everyone wants to work in his or her hometown however if you cannot make a living there and you do not get what you deserve you have to find other ways
8760892 no field owner can pick his entire harvest by himself we cannot harvest our products if these workers do not come we like them too we try to please them and they try to please us
8760893 we can withstand any difficult conditions if we can topple samak
8760894 simply stated the court has given the government a sword but officials concerned will enforce the court order with caution
8760895 greek cypriot leader dimitris christofias tells me that unlike my situation in which turkish cypriot prime minister ferdi sabit soyer can take over governmental duties he needs more time because he has to continue to govern so christofias wants to meet once a week instead of twice
8760896 our target via resolution is to create a federal and united cyprus that integrates with the world
8760897 a promise to keep time to end the international isolation of the turkish cypriots
8760898 we hope the study plays a role in facilitating the upcoming negotiations any step taken in the direction of lifting the isolations is likely to boost trust between both sides of the island
8760899 lifting the isolation on the kktc will not necessarily amount to or require its recognition as a nation state
8760900 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8760901 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
8760902 but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well i think it is a demonstration of complete confusion
8760903 the appearance of nato battleships here in the black sea basin and the decision to deliver humanitarian aid to georgia using nato battleships is something that can hardly be explained
8760904 let us hope that we do not see any direct confrontation
8760905 there is certainly no nato build up in the black sea
8760906 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8760907 liberalizing turkish education islam secularism and the future of democracy
8760908 there are various kinds of secularism you cannot buy secularism from walmart in a package
8760909 i think there is a balance but at every political convention there are celebrities that come
8760910 an opportunity for 80 000 people who might otherwise not have been able to participate to get involved
8760911 in terms of the tough measures nato is considering for russia possibilities are growing that ankara may end up alienated from the west
8760912 right now bulgaria romania ukraine and georgia want a nato presence to counterbalance russia in the black sea in sum the number of black sea littoral states that do want nato there is bigger than those that do not in fact russia and nato member turkey are the only littoral states that do not want nato in the black sea
8760913 in addition to recent developments in the caucasus bilateral issues will be discussed
8760914 some individual persons are not reading the montreux convention but they are writing it let them read it for gods sake
8760915 the montreux convention is being implemented word for word at the moment there is no situation in the black sea that is contrary to the montreux convention it is that simple
8760916 if the nato ships continue to stay in the black sea after the expiration of the 21 day period then i would like to remind you that turkey would be responsible
8760917 there is certainly no nato build up in the black sea
8760918 speaking frankly i believe that it may have an impact but at this very moment i cannot predict in which direction this impact will be
8760919 this issue is not a consequence of the cold war era it is completely separate from the crisis that emerged recently second turkish cypriots and greek cypriots established the republic of cyprus at the time as partners they were partners when the state was founded problems emerged since the partnership didnt function and since conditions of partnership were not met and this is the reason that led to separation
8760920 another point which needs care is the fact that there is a negotiation process at the un one that has been going on for many years that is to say legislation has been made a referendum was held by the mutual will of both sides taking all of these facts into consideration i hope that everyone will see that the cyprus issue is a much more just and much more legitimate issue in regard to turkish cypriots
8760921 we aim to solve the cyprus problem within 2008 we think that a solution is possible in this short timeframe we will be at the table with all our goodwill
8760922 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8760923 hey i can walk 10 steps to the salad section and get lettuce from them
8760924 then why does it say open and the doors are propped open and everyone is just standing around
8760925 we went on a saturday afternoon for an early dinner

8760959 how can you read this theres no pictures well some people use their imagination

8760975 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8760976 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush

8760991 a democratic insider said that there had been a loot sic of private polling done on the democratic side that indicates that on the fence voters would not buy a direct slam on mccain and that they would not absorb any negative information about him unless the attacker paid tribute to mccains military service the consultant was adamant on this point s he maintained that the polling did show that voter perceptions of mccain could be changed to benefit obama if the attack was crafted the right way and mccain was not merely blasted

8761007 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome
8761008 wij hebben het recht niet om mea culpa te blijven slaan voor onze zogezegde onverdraagzaamheid als wij systematisch met onverdraagzaamheid worden geconfronteerd

8761040 that free speech is curtailed during the democratic national convention underscores the need for continued protection of civil liberties regardless of the party in power
8761041 the use of unnecessary force and the arrest of a journalist who was reporting an important political story

8761043 so i have a solution to the health care crisis and it will cost not one thin dime
8761044 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care so there you have it voila problem solved
8761045 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care

8761094 weve been consulting with local authorities across the u k for some months now about removing pay phones that arent really being used and are therefore unprofitable for bt
8761095 some authorities recognized their pay phone was not being used but wanted to keep their traditional red telephone box on the village green for aesthetic reasons because its part of the british heritage
8761096 we had other councils who said they really wanted to maintain a working telephone service plus the box itself
8761097 thats about half the annual cost to bt of maintaining a public pay phone

8761107 the gdp figures were better than expected helping to put fears of recession on the back burner for at least the short term and this positive sentiment spilled over into london trading
8761108 there is a view that we are close to a ceiling for the paid for download market simply because there are so many ways for consumers to get music for free
8761109 consumers are showing that they want their music for free and record labels are finally starting to ask can we make money from free
8761110 so the labels are looking across at the people who are making money under the free model and that is the device manufacturers such as apple and nokia
8761111 never say never but customers dont seem to be interested in it the subscription model has failed so far
8761112 whilst the near term outlook for the land and property sectors remains very turbulent we believe the long term outlook remains positive given the shortage of sites available for development in the uk this is where the potential lies for uk coal
8761113 the model has matured to a point where it can demonstrate considerable success the net asset value nav as a proportion of market value is currently increasing rapidly at the end of 2007 value of the portfolio as a proportion of net cash invested was 6 7 times more difficult to value are the intangible items such as access to future ip from the university relationships and the other ip agglomeration models we forecast a nav of 235m by the end of 2008 we estimate it is already 225m
8761114 the past six months have continued to demonstrate pinewood sheppertons ability to diversify and deliver consistent revenue streams even in times of wider economic uncertainty

8761122 memory dumps are a record of what was in memory and the registers at the time of a crash
8761123 to sit and worry about inflation expectations rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8761124 people have to start to respond to the fact that we are in a recession and the danger is well be in a very serious and long lasting recession unless we do something this is a call to action
8761125 certainly has a great deal of wishful thinking attached to it
8761126 i feel that things i have been fearful about have come to pass and i have actually been pretty accurate in whats coming and i have failed to convince the others of what is appropriate
8761127 people need to understand that sometimes you will have to focus on the timing of issues i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on
8761128 i thought 30 per cent was the potential fall we could see
8761129 i think that might even now be optimistic i think 30 per cent does look a fairly optimistic number and markets are now coming around to that view
8761130 the uk is one of the most competitive mobile markets in europe and we need our regulation to adapt to make sure we maintain that momentum
8761131 not everything will need more regulation in some cases it may well mean less
8761132 we want to get ahead of the game and ask sharp questions about whether there is a superior alternative not just presume that what we have done so far is right way
8761133 it may be that there isnt a better option and the alternatives are worse
8761134 the premise of the uso is largely gone not because people are not using the telephone but because they have a mobile

8761150 despite californias mandate to aggressively reduce greenhouse gases the california energy commission is allowing new power plants to be built without evaluating their impacts on climate change
8761151 the energy commission needs to champion clean energy by making sure new energy sources reduce harm to the climate
8761152 business as usual is devastating to our climate and local environment
8761153 global warming is already harming sierra species like the pika and is projected to have a significant effect on the states snowpack and water supplies in the near future

8761161 over 50 years ago the cervical smear test was introduced which should be applauded for the immensely positive impact it had and will continue to have on womens health in new zealand
8761162 the national hpv immunisation programme will work hand in hand with cervical smear testing to ensure that lives are saved through prevention as well as detection and cure
8761163 this really is one of the most significant steps forward for cancer prevention in new zealand
8761164 the ethical question is not whether it is right to vaccinate girls against a cancer that can be spread by sexual contact it is how best we can protect the lives of new zealands women to my mind the national hpv immunisation programme is the obvious answer
8761165 did not control fund raising activities or ensure compliance with state law and department policy
8761166 although the conference brochure stated that the fee for conservation officers was 175 the department actually paid 260 for each of its 205 officers

8761172 the fact that all russian politicians are clever the stupid ones are all dead by contrast america in its complacency promotes dullards a deadly miscommunication arises from this asymmetry the russians cannot believe that the americans are as stupid as they look and conclude that washington wants to destroy them these perceptions are dangerous because they do not stem from propaganda but from a difference in existential vantage point russia is fighting for its survival against a catastrophic decline in its population and the likelihood of a muslim majority by mid century americas interest in georgia the russians believe has nothing more to do with promoting democracy than its support for the gangsters to whom it handed the serbian province of kosovo in february chess players think in terms of the interaction of pieces everything on the periphery combines to control the center of the board and prepare an eventual attack against the opponents king the russians simply cannot absorb the fact that america has no strategic intentions it simply adds up the value of the individual pieces on the board it is as stupid as that dull people know that clever people are cleverer than they are but they do not know why the nekulturny uncultured colonel ralph peters a former us military intelligence analyst is impressed by the tactical success of russian arms in georgia but cannot fathom the end game to which these tactics contribute if the un demographers are correct russias adult population will fall from about 90 million today to only 20 million by the end of the century russia in other words has passed the point of no return in terms of fertility some demographers predict a muslim majority in russia by 2040 and by mid century at the latest the west has two choices draw a line in the sand around the ukraine or trade it to the russians for something more important the west should do its best to pretend that the orange revolution of 2004 and 2005 never happened and secure russias assistance in the iranian nuclear issue as well as energy security in return for an understanding of russias existential requirements in the near abroad anyone who thinks this sounds cyncial should spend a week in kiev russia has more to fear from a nuclear armed iran than the us one irony of the present crisis is that washingtons neo conservatives by demanding a tough stance against russia may have harmed israels security interests more profoundly than any of israels detractors in american politics if america turns russia into a strategic adversary the probability of israels survival will drop by a big notch

8761186 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8761187 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8761188 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8761189 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight

8761216 when i was younger it was books like spawn that made me want to draw comic books for a living so to actually have the ability to fulfill that dream on spawn really cant be beat
8761217 its fun is to see if your characters can fit into different settings genres mediums and or formats as a means to get your idea in front of more new eyes adventures of spawn is such an attempt unlike the regular title this one is truly built around the word adventure join us as we dive head first into a world of spawn unlike the others ive populated

8761229 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8761230 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second

8761232 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly

8761234 theres a signal there for the market that people are putting a lot of this financial crisis behind them finally

8761236 search for or seize any work product materials possessed by a person reasonably believed to have a purpose to disseminate to the public a newspaper or broadcast

8761248 theres definitely a growing trend in the state of west virginia for all hospitals to be tobacco free campus wide and thats something weve been considering for quite some time
8761249 for instance if youre having a cigarette at a certain time of day what kind of behavior can we change at that time of day so that youre not smoking
8761250 well it gives them some particular tools on how exactly to quit so its not just saying well go ahead and quit not you know you should stop smoking because its bad for you but this is how you can do it
8761251 i try all the time and i cant lose weight what can i do
8761252 worldwide avian flu control efforts have been mostly successful but like seasonal influenza avian flu changes year to year creating new subtypes and strains that could easily and quickly spread among humans
8761253 vlps may be advantageous over other vaccine strategies because they are easy to develop produce and manufacture
8761254 using recombinant technologies within ten weeks we could generate a vaccine most effective towards the current circulating strain of virus making it a cost effective counter measure to the threat of an avian influenza pandemic
8761255 i remember when i was a kid watching wrestling i think jake the snake and rick rude had an angle for a whole year it literally lasted a year
8761256 oh my gosh we got a lot out of that one
8761257 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8761258 hey doj while youre there giving what we see as your silent treatment were going to go ahead and start making more money mkay kay
8761259 if you want change it is time for latinos and for immigrants to rally behind the next president of the united states barack obama tonight i ask my friends in the latino community in the immigrant community please join me because barack obama is the change we need
8761260 w hen barack obama occupies the white house that is the community our president will defend and respect by fighting for comprehensive immigration reform reform that keeps mothers and children and families together reform that brings hard working people out of the shadows of disgrace and into the sunlight of dignity that enforces our laws keeps our borders secure and our nation safe
8761261 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
8761262 if russia wants to change saakashvili and that was its aim here then its steps here were absolutely stupid
8761263 when we have a threat to our internal safety a military occupation then all georgians despite our political views or differences between us we must unite
8761264 even the radical opposition that says all of this was the result of the failure of saakashvili does not question the territorial integrity of georgia
8761265 if they found someone who could replace saakashvili he would have to explain why russias invasion was good
8761266 they can tighten control over trade in the winter they can engineer shortages to provoke popular discontent
8761267 as for saakashvili and his regime it is true that we do not like him
8761268 this is a question that should not be addressed to me but to the georgian government and maybe more accurately to the georgian people and of course those who have been supporting mr saakashvili
8761269 the russians are trying to say the whole problem is saakashvili and if only not for saakashvili they could normalize relations
8761270 first they are blaming everything on saakashvili and if someone will sacrifice saakashvili they will slice the next one
8761271 i think everyone has a hurricane preparedness plan that we might not have had previously
8761272 weve got a command center now that is hurricane proof that was being constructed when rita hit so we do now have a secured command center where some of your emergency responders can meet
8761273 some of our customers are talking about having us work this weekend to get product into the supply line to feed their customers
8761274 one of the things learned from rita is that we have more advanced planning better communications and people are taking these storms a lot more seriously than we did in the past
8761275 trust me as soon as they even mention we start looking at it we watch everything down there and try to react as best we can each day
8761276 we are working toward a full evacuation of shell operated assets in the gulf
8761277 we expect to evacuate the remaining 600 personnel on friday and saturday
8761278 the process is comparable to a trip wire if it takes a plant 36 hours to empty its tanks of inventory and fill them with water and if the plant is in the storm arc 36 5 hours out shutdown procedures are enacted
8761279 these kinds of events are different just about every time and new variables can arise from the uncertainties that come with each storm
8761280 were better prepared to handle a catastrophe from an insurance point of view
8761281 there are just a whole lot of little parts to this situation that i am better prepared to handle
8761282 you are never prepared for a catastrophic event but we are better prepared
8761283 people think that if they survived katrina they can survive anything maybe maybe not
8761284 we took a broad range of testimony from people who wanted to give us an oversight of where is the renewable fuels industry right now and where is it going from here whats it going to cost and what are the benefits going to be as well as the setbacks
8761285 we want to be an honest arbiter of the true state of renewable fuels in the state of wisconsin
8761286 every other piece of evidence out there says completely the opposite
8761287 get people the facts so they can base their decisions on that rather than industry propaganda or talk radio rantings
8761288 a lot of audacity of hope right now no question about it
8761289 we got to see him today we got to see him he was going that way and waving at everyone so it worth standing here for two hours well worth it

8761313 heres a little political fact dick cheney is the first vice president in 80 years not to run for president actually cheney did consider four more years but his doctor only gave him 2 1 2
8761314 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8761315 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8761316 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8761317 incorporated in jersey and tax resident in the republic of ireland
8761318 notwithstanding recent suggestions concerning possible changes to uk tax laws the directors believe that the most appropriate structure is for the new parent company of henderson to be tax resident in the republic of ireland
8761319 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8761320 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8761321 i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful i know that full well
8761322 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8761323 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8761324 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8761325 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8761326 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8761327 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8761328 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8761329 we have targeted costs reductions in a number of areas including people marketing travel and property costs with a particular focus on our transactional and financial services businesses which have been most affected by the downturn
8761330 this just isnt good enough the housing market is in a very serious position and we need serious action
8761331 we have continually called on the government to hold a roundtable discussion to find real solutions to stamp duty the liquidity issue first time buyers and repossessions
8761332 there is no point trying to target one area in the hope of a quick fix we need a coherent package of measures that will ease problems throughout the housing market
8761333 we have been investing this year particularly behind the big four category leaders weve got smirnoff baileys bells and gordons
8761334 weve been working with the retailers to produce a shelf layout and a combination of products that works
8761335 our concern is that perceived defensiveness could be tested during the year to june 2009 given a 55 operating profit exposure to the problem housing market economies of the us uk spain and ireland together with increasing signs of slowing growth in certain emerging markets
8761336 this is the most significant most violent and most long lasting of all the financial crises we have had since the second world war
8761337 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items
8761338 retail conditions have been extremely tough this summer and the wet august has been a further blow sadly no let up is expected as we head into early autumn the business outlook is particularly weak and retailers are having to scale back their employment and investment plans in an attempt to ride out the storm
8761339 augusts cbi distributive trades survey makes for pretty grim reading not least because the reported sales balance fell to yet a new record low and the surveys been going since the early 1980s suggesting that conditions on the high street are even worse than in the previous recession even a near term cut in interest rates wont bail out the economy over the next few months indeed we now expect both consumer spending and overall gdp to fall next year
8761340 this improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence such as cheaper petrol offers summer holidays happening or just a general feeling of things cant get any worse can they in particular winning gold medals in the olympics seems to have had a lifting effect when we looked at the index score before and after the olympics weekend the score rose 3 points between the first and second weekend this combined with summer holiday euphoria may have helped lift consumers perceptions of their personal situation and the general economy
8761341 from here we believe that the company has the opportunity to address its cost base more aggressively
8761342 the references to difficult trading conditions encouraged the market generally to write down its forecasts for the company
8761343 it may seem madness to stay on buy given current sector news flow but we think the yield provides a solid underpinning and believe the medium term upside when a recovery in transaction volumes occurs could be very material
8761344 we can see far better returns in larger more liquid stocks such as hbos
8761345 with net debt now in excess of 1 8bn nervousness over gearing is unlikely to go away any time soon
8761346 our expectations for the year as a whole remain unchanged with progress weighted towards the second half as the benefit of all these fundamental actions begin to flow through
8761347 like most people he didnt believe indian food could be eaten at lunchtime
8761348 which is phenomenal in the restaurant industry a good restaurant will do 150 covers
8761349 were not a restaurant where you go for an intimate dinner
8761350 were not a tandoori restaurant in tandoori restaurants you wont find a single indian customer
8761351 they make one large sauce boil the meat and if you want a korma and i want a madras the same chicken and the same sauce is used but you would have a bit of cream in yours and id have a bit of chilli in mine its served within 10 15 minutes and thats where the indian food market was developed
8761352 a lot of the recipes are inspired by my mum like the samosas
8761353 were not a fusion restaurant you wont find scallops or quails
8761354 one of the reasons for us buying bombay bicycle club was that more people are staying in and having a takeaway
8761355 a ladys bra is made out of 26 different components its all about learning how to make a product and ensuring its the best product of the highest quality i built my business around a lot of the ethos of marks amp spencer which is about never compromising on quality high customer service and running a business very tightly
8761356 my ambition is to get to 200 000 a day then ill be a happy man and hopefully a rich man at the same time
8761357 the mentality of letting go across the channel seems to be the same one that makes les anglais get drunk as soon as they leave their country
8761358 with barack obama bill and hillary clinton and even joe biden the democrats are streets ahead of the republicans in oratorical skill george bush dick cheney and john mccain are pathetic by comparison but it seems to be doubtful how much this matters
8761359 we achieved these results despite a trading environment that is becoming tougher with signs of slowing demand particularly in spain the us and the uk
8761360 consequently our revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 is less certain
8761361 taking some early steps to tighten our cost base in a number of markets nonetheless we remain confident of delivering a result for the year at the upper end of market expectations
8761362 wholesale used car prices witnessed the biggest single monthly reduction in over five years
8761363 we expect that the current price correction in the used car market has some way to go although we anticipate that it will have run its course by the end of the year
8761364 these market conditions are causing volume and margin pressure in addition like most other companies in the uk we have been affected by rising costs which we have already taken action to mitigate
8761365 the latest figures are excellent news for most passengers however the regular closure of parts of the network for engineering work causes substantial disruption and inconvenience to many passengers and freight customers as well as deterring others from using the network altogether
8761366 for rail to make its full contribution to our economy it is important that this disruption is reduced significantly we have been taking steps to ensure this happens
8761367 over the next five years nr must continue to carry out a full schedule of maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure together with a massive programme of enhancements to increase network capacity
8761368 we have been telling the industry for some time that passengers need accurate timely and coordinated information when engineering works take place
8761369 passengers recognise that engineering works are necessary and will tolerate some short term inconvenience for real long term gain but the rail industry should do more to inform passengers not only of the engineering works but also the benefits the work will bring
8761370 reducing disruption caused by improvement work is a central pillar of our plans in the years ahead delivering a railway at weekends to the standard we see during the week must be our goal and weve asked the orr for significant funds to make this seven day railway a reality
8761371 we are seeing the best levels of punctuality for 10 years with nine out of 10 trains running on time on many lines however we want to see further improvements and expect a major reduction in the delays which inconvenience rail users the most
8761372 i think it should be much lower it was just 355 and it jumped up another 10 cents

8761379 sometimes i come up here at night even when im not fixing the clocks just to look at the city i like to imagine that the world is one big machine you know machines never have any extra parts they have the exact number and type of parts they need so i figure if the entire world is a big machine i have to be here for some reason and that means you have to be here for some reason too

8761385 is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing conditions is low
8761386 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8761387 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small quarter point cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8761388 with the economy set to contract over the next year the outlook for the housing market remains bleak
8761389 what began as a fall in prices is fast becoming a housing crash the governments public dithering over whether to offer a stamp duty holiday is making a bad problem worse
8761390 compared with other forecasters nationwide is usually conservative in its predictions of house price falls so when it tells us there is a big fall we know something very serious is happening all the signs are that we are at the beginning and not the end of a very painful process rather than dithering over crackpot schemes to prop up the housing market the government must act to help the many thousands in danger of losing their homes
8761391 all the most memorable items to look back on are gone
8761392 we have been given a number to call an overseas customer service team who dont understand what im asking for or why im a little upset
8761393 virgin wont allow us to claim until 21 days are up well after our reception and our own insurance policy requires us to wait 31 days
8761394 the latest figures are excellent news for most passengers however the regular closure of parts of the network for engineering work causes substantial disruption and inconvenience to many passengers and freight customers as well as deterring others from using the network altogether

8761409 but i wanted to just be there just to see and witness history
8761410 were honored that these great artists are lending their voices to this celebration of two american icons john steinbeck and woody guthrie were the voices of a generation and the issues that resonated with them over 50 years ago still remain issues that we face today
8761411 when the inspection group comes the chairpersons of the peoples units contact each other in advance so inspections can be avoided nowadays how a peoples unit chairperson acts affects the price of housing
8761412 people who buy homes now cannot distinguish between good and bad homes but pay great attention to the peoples unit in the neighborhood if the peoples unit chairperson is not so sophisticated then the neighborhood cannot come together so people tend to avoid such neighborhoods and the price of housing tends to fall as well
8761413 if an inspection unit comes suddenly the peoples unit chairperson tends to alert every household through the children in the village which has been described as the pastime of the peoples unit the more a peoples unit chairperson excels at this the less damage to the people of the unit
8761414 officials or big time merchants pay careful attention to their relationship with the chairpersons no matter what the type of inspection is the citizens attitude can be assumed via the words of the chairperson of the peoples unit so the fate of a household depends on the words of the chairperson
8761415 depending on the extent of the damage to the peoples unit during the inspections people distinguish whether or not the peoples unit chairperson is smart and experienced or not if the chairperson is judged to be not smart then he or she has to relinquish his or her position
8761416 big time merchants pay careful attention to their relationship with the chairpersons
8761417 it is no surprise the american public chose a poodle for obama
8761418 thats the way it is and if you dont like it go die in a hole
8761419 i tried to be a programmer by taking classes back in high school and it just didnt stick at all
8761420 i spoke to him about the possibility and he said well thats interesting why dont you convince me
8761421 i said all right what the heck i might as well just give it a shot and just start doing things and see if they say no
8761422 i have lists with everyone who has this very high end solid legal experience
8761423 and then i have a list of everyone who plays video games at the firm
8761424 where the law gets made is in these kinds of new technology cases because the video game has to have the best technology
8761425 when were dealing with a circuit its typically embedded within a chip and therefore not as visible to the industry
8761426 when were dealing with video game clients a lot of the time there are a lot of people out there that are digging through the code and figuring out whats going on its easier for companies to become the target
8761427 even though im junior the way i put it is yeah im young but the industry is young i have plenty of experience playing their games
8761428 plus youre taking time away from your clients your colleagues your family
8761429 there is no longer the assumption that law firms are inherently stable immune from debt overload market influences and other financial disasters
8761430 every year the financial information becomes more transparent and so the level of knowledge that lawyers have about how their firm fares compared to competitors increases every year
8761431 we have seen lateral partner deals that would typically have closed in the first quarter of 2008 pushed out to the second and third quarters
8761432 the movement is really its no surprise from the old line san francisco firms to the newcomers
8761433 we see them moving to other firms we have conversations with them
8761434 theyre thinking harder about the firms strategy and which practice areas are important to the firm
8761435 clients are under pressure to consolidate their work with as few law firms as possible
8761436 id love to give you our employment work but your firm is too expensive
8761437 this year so many firms arent profitable or arent profitable enough for that to be a meaningful number that its changed the dynamics
8761438 its one less factor keeping people in their own firm
8761439 we may see fewer moves in the fourth quarter of 2008 because the firms will want to defer costs until 2009
8761440 we cant go on with double digit increases as far as the eye can see
8761441 a critical priority for management now is managing expectations and educating partners that some small percentage drop in profits is not the end of the world
8761442 firms are really struggling with what their numbers need to be
8761443 they need to think about a variety of practice areas instead of going to a firm thinking its real estate or bust
8761444 senator obama this is truly a good day for america mccain says in the ad

8761503 12 in these he said there would be a millennium after the resurrection and that there would be a corporeal reign of christ on this very earth which things he appeared to have imagined as if they were authorized by apostolic narrations not understanding correctly those matters which they propounded mystically in their representations
8761504 they are not to be heard who assure themselves that there is to be an earthly reign of a thousand years who think with the heretic cerinthus for the kingdom of christ is now eternal in the saints although the glory of the saints shall be manifest after the resurrection
8761505 for behold the kingdom of god is within you and among you
8761506 but what about the 1000 year reign spoken of in revelation 20

8761521 we should always be aware and cautious when we are driving but need to take extra precautions now that many schools are back in session and our children will be near our busy roadways in great numbers on a daily basis
8761522 expect the unexpected when it comes to children roadways and intersections dont assume the child will not step out into the street assume the opposite and be ready to react
8761523 we should all take the time to ensure our children are educated and aware

8761537 on some occasions in respect of the bail matters one was as bad as the other with her regularly approaching mr mcnaught
8761538 the situation got so ridiculous that she was at court waiting for him
8761539 the relationship is now felt by mr mcnaught to be over i think it might be fair to say that she has finally come to her senses given what he has pled guilty to doing to her over the last seven years
8761540 his previous convictions are almost entirely in relation to that relationship

8761557 our conservatory roof started leaking and we contacted cameron and couldnt get anyone but i eventually spoke to someone who told me the firm had gone into liquidation
8761558 she told me to get on to network veka because i had the 10 year policy with them
8761559 i phoned network veka and was told they couldnt help me because cameron had never made the policy with them
8761560 now my husband has had to do the work himself

8761635 this is an important milestone toward securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger
8761636 to ensure the commitment is effectively implemented we must redouble our efforts to eliminate poaching and illegal settlements within this special forest
8761637 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
8761638 and while we greatly appreciate this precedent for more protection from the indonesian government there are other areas on sumatra that need safeguarding for the sake of its wildlife its threatened indigenous peoples and to reduce the climate impacts of clearing
8761639 since 1983 a total of 47 people have been hurt or killed as a result of animals at circuses

8761649 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8761650 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8761651 we are seriously considering an action for damages for the baseless arrest there is proof they were tortured and kept in isolation

8761655 i am pleased this grant has been provided for research which will bolster the long term success of aquaculture off new hampshires coasts
8761656 we are very pleased with sen r greggs support of our open ocean aquaculture research here at unh
8761657 his support has allowed us to successfully compete for and secure funding from noaa for this project
8761658 technology for offshore aquaculture has advanced significantly in recent years however we need to achieve greater efficiency for production of native species like cod haddock and halibut to be commercially viable
8761659 growth of marine organisms on cage surfaces increases drag forces and reduces the flow of oxygen rich water to the fish
8761660 a lot of the crops are going off at the moment but its more the latest sown crops that are really struggling so its crunch time and any rain would help
8761661 its so frustrating that the season is starting so late and plus its getting fairly warm so an ideal would be a couple of inches of rain
8761662 if we got rain it would still be an alright season but we are sitting right on the edge and it could go either way

8761668 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8761669 we conclude that reversal of clarks conviction is necessary in the case to ensure fairness and integrity of the judicial process
8761670 accordingly we hold that the court committed plain error when it failed to give the accomplice jury instruction and that clarks convictions must therefore be reversed on this basis
8761671 we disagree strongly on the courts ruling that there was any error in the trial
8761672 we certainly will not give up easily on prosecuting someone who participated in the murder of a st paul police officer
8761673 i would reverse clarks conviction outright and not remand for a new trial
8761674 a minha vontade ir para o brasil mas tem essa prioridade da copa dos campe es para o shakthar estamos em um grupo bom e temos chances de passar para as oitavas de final ent o eles falaram para eu esperar mais um pouco vamos aguardar e cabe ao corinthians e o shakthar entrarem em acordo
8761675 se eu conversar com o presidente e o treinador e der tudo certo se deus quiser estarei no corinthians no ano que vem
8761676 i dont believe in these meals and the fact they think it is a good idea to spend ratepayers money in such a way is not right
8761677 i called the dinner on monday the last supper as it will probably be the last time the group dines together as there may be people who miss out on another term at the election
8761678 being a councillor is a privilege and i think there are things that could be done with the money spent
8761679 ive been told that council spends about 7000 8000 per year on such meals and get togethers but that money could be used for things to make dubbo better
8761680 the august council meeting was the final meeting for the 11 councillors who have represented the city since march 2004
8761681 a function to acknowledge their contribution to the city with their partners and prior to the end of their term of office is normal practice

8761684 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8761685 we deplore russia s excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8761686 the russians will block our airspace and will not let me return to the country
8761687 well why does the rnc run a candidate who is constitutionally ineligible to be president
8761688 based on the original meaning of the constitution the framers intentions and subsequent legal and historical precedent senator mccains birth to parents who were u s citizens serving on a u s military base in the panama canal zone in 1936 makes him a natural born citizen within the meaning of the constitution
8761689 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
8761690 no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years and been fourteen years a resident within the united states
8761691 is where only the natural act of one being born in a place determines the status of ones citizenship with no additional stipulations necessary to influence that status

8761701 at 12 daylight hours out we will call for the mandatory evacuation and start busing people to shelters
8761702 our number of occupancy in trailers is down below a reasonable amount to shelter in county now so those that have to leave the county will have to drive out themselves
8761703 we commend the u s department of justice criminal divisions computer crime and intellectual property section the u s attorneys offices for the western district of north carolina and the eastern district of virginia and the federal bureau of investigation for their work in bringing these criminals to justice
8761704 these decisions illustrate once again that game piracy will not be tolerated and the extent at which these criminals will be prosecuted the esa and its members will continue to support law enforcements efforts to protect the intellectual property of our industry

8761712 all this fighting is just distracting us from the real enemies
8761713 people with differing views put forth their beliefs in polite discourse
8761714 the modern day undercurrent of antipathy by society as a whole is spookily similar to the antipathy which was present against early christians
8761715 all this fighting is just distracting us from the real enemies

8761718 if tortures as horrific as these were still morally acceptable to the majority they would still be carried out and most definitely be carried out against atheists but we as society have moved on since then hmmm coincidentally since churches no longer rule nations funny that

8761732 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8761733 the more laws the better for them the more arrests the better for them
8761734 not just the right to smoke pot but the horrendous urine testing industry and the imprisoning of non violent drug offenders which is
8761735 brazen impressed us with the clarity of their response to our brief they immediately understood where we needed to be and have presented a clear strategy of how to get there
8761736 the refreshing smooth tasting water not only turns your recommended daily intake of 1 5l of water into a pleasurable experience but also brightens your skin
8761737 the caucus is the area where they can convince the premier and treasurer to withdraw this
8761738 we think thats the first step that we ought to take if we are unsuccessful there therell be a meeting of all the workers representatives in the first instance to give consideration to what steps they might take into the future
8761739 they thought this matter was finished and what weve seen now is the government trying to breathe life into a dead cat
8761740 these workers are going to be very angry i think if we dont see this matter withdrawn then its likely therell be a meeting of these workers next week to give consideration to all sorts of things
8761741 this is something that wont be able to occur overnight
8761742 the union campaign is very well formed very well organised and i believe that we will have the support of the rest of the energy industry unions to oppose this campaign
8761743 the premiers had four inquiries hes done everything he can to meet the various requirements of a number of different stakeholders in the debate on each occasion his proposals have been given strong support and it seems we couldnt move forward
8761744 the premier and his decisive action has clearly demonstrated that hes putting the needs of the economy in terms of investment and jobs to the forefront in terms of energy supply to the forefront
8761745 we have state federal and we thought we had the rail operators commitment to a tripartite agreement on the expenditure of well in excess of 120 million
8761746 but weve always been led to believe as a business community that the state money is dependent on the federal and that both the federal money and the state money is dependant on the pacific nationals money or the rail operators money
8761747 now if the rail operator is now not bound under contractual arrangement then rail is back totally in the question mark for the state of tasmania
8761748 chief minister how does this reconcile with the decisions by your government
8761749 would you believe zed seselja the struggling frantic frazzled browbeaten out of his depth leader of the opposition who would you believe

8761751 human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area
8761752 these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks
8761753 burning and looting of ethnic georgian villages in south ossetia
8761754 all of this adds up to compelling evidence of war crimes and grave human rights abuses
8761755 this should persuade the russian government it needs to prosecute those responsible for these crimes
8761756 the ossetians had cars outside and first looted everything they liked then they brought hay put it in the house and ignited it the house was burned in front of my eyes
8761757 i was beaten and my house was looted by ossetian militias three times during a single day after they took everything and there was nothing more to loot they brought petrol poured it everywhere in the rooms and outside the house and then put it on fire they made me watch as my house was fully burned
8761758 they ossetians came several times to my house and took everything they liked once there was nothing else to take they poured petrol and put it on fire i watched how they burned my house as well as my neighbors houses
8761759 ossetians first took out everything they could from my house then they brought hay put it in the house and put it on fire they did not allow us to take even our documents i saw how my house was completely burnt
8761760 those movements carefully position the flys centre of mass relative to the jumping legs so that leg extension propels them away from the looming threat
8761761 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8761762 the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small changes in its posture to reach the correct pre flight stance
8761763 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8761764 i think it is impossible for him to play for england
8761765 thats my personal opinion this will be his first start and i wont be playing him for the full game it depends on how he feels at half time but it certainly wont be any more than an hour
8761766 i dont think he is ready for that in fact we know he is not ready for that he will need to get a proper recovery get proper training if it wasnt such an important game you could say well give him a bit of a game but i cant see it it is too important for capello and england
8761767 ive always accepted the challenge and always took it on this will just be another great challenge as a footballer youve got to prove yourself every week regardless youre out there in every game getting judged
8761768 robinho is a great player so having him around will be great for the squad
8761769 we want to win the title this season thats the priority
8761770 our squad is complete and it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have
8761771 i find it incredible that a club like chelsea has not realised that not only is the deal not done but that the president and the coach of real have said they do not want to sell maybe it was a mistake but it is a pretty astonishing mistake to make if robinho thinks he has to leave real to become the best player in the world he is wrong
8761772 when you leave madrid it is impossible to end up at a better club
8761773 im not going to go for someone up 6 2 6 2 5 2 it was a bad miss but a miss that i hit very hard it took a little bit i was really excited about the way i was playing and then you know to kind of end it like that it was a little i guess disappointing and i can definitely probably understand where hes coming from if i was in the same situation id probably be momentarily pissed off too it is what it is i think ill probably try to find him here in the next couple of days and at least tell him that it wasnt my intention it was my intention to hit it hard you know but its a serve i rarely hit actually you know body there flat its unfortunate but it happens
8761774 i think the biggest thing is when youre confident you win even when you feel youre not playing well you see guys do it a lot thats the thing that just comes with matches and winning matches
8761775 its a nice feeling just to get womens tennis out there
8761776 there are women out there who are doing things in british tennis and its nice to know that its not just andy murray out there
8761777 most of the top end players now have a team support group
8761778 claire curran and i do annes coaching claire will travel with her for 10 or 11 weeks of the year ill go to each of the grand slams and when we cant be there will send one of the other coaches or a trainer so she is supported by four or five people throughout the year
8761779 i felt like i did it myself and i was quite proud of that
8761780 that was quite a big thing but claires been helping me nigels been helping me and thats been great and theyve been really good to me and i need that kind of support its ok to be on your own for a while but sometimes you need someone to kick you up the arse
8761781 i have to order the creme brulee and my coaches must sit in the same seats
8761782 hopefully they wont use the designer who had two goes at doing the 7th because if you have two goes to get it to that stage well my kids could do better in one afternoon
8761783 the people i feel sorry for are those who are trying to get into the ryder cup this is a big week for them they must be feeling the pressure and it cant help standing over a three footer not knowing if the putt is going to run straight
8761784 shooting three over isnt going to do a lot for my chances but i dont think i have played myself out of it either i could have done but managed to scramble and keep things together
8761785 the greens are not overly smooth but i felt i was a little bit unlucky every time i hit it in the rough i got a bad lie
8761786 i have a couple of important rounds left to play this week so lets just leave the greens as they are
8761787 if we have any more violence we could withdraw the champions league final from rome its not an ultimatum just a message that we are keeping an eye on it
8761788 its not an easy draw for us and the overwhelming feeling after wednesdays game against standard li ge is that we are just happy to be involved
8761789 the tie against atl tico madrid is the one that stands out and will inevitably generate a lot of interest it will mean a lot to all the spanish players but especially torres
8761790 the pleasing aspect is that there will not be an awful lot of travel involved
8761791 given that our next two league games are away at liverpool and chelsea were particularly pleased that the game that falls between those two is at home against villarreal
8761792 in last weeks press conference i said i was less optimistic and im even less optimistic today
8761793 ive no idea whats going on its very hard to get communication with some people
8761794 its the first time ive seen him smile properly for ages because hes going to play football again
8761795 its such great news im delighted for him ive spoken at length to mark hughes and now i know hes going to be playing regularly
8761796 when he would come around to my house id wind him up by showing him videos of himself playing at manchester city and say this is what you used to do youre not the player you were
8761797 we want shaun to be playing regularly for us as well as for england it shows our ambition and where this club wants to be to other players and we have the means to attract them
8761798 i asked shaun what he wanted to do and he said i want to go back to city
8761799 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8761800 my lawyers have asked for a meeting with the fa because i still believe there is a witchhunt because at the end of the day what are my transfers to rangers liverpool and newcastle to do with portsmouth
8761801 the part when i was interviewed about benjani ok an extract of that should have been sent to portsmouth im ok with that but sending the whole interview to portsmouth which lasted about six hours and was a document of about 100 pages
8761802 at the end of the day if ive done it ive done it but what have i done wrong
8761803 we are not prepared to discuss the details of an ongoing case due to confidentiality
8761804 it didnt feel like a big game at the time
8761805 the stadium was half empty and it was a strange atmosphere around the hotel its just monaco i guess its a different place
8761806 the super cup has not always figured as the most prestigious trophy in the uefa calendar and i must admit that at one time it did not rank all that highly for me either
8761807 but ill tell you one thing for certain and its that manchester united will be giving it everything we have got
8761808 one of the few teams who have four people in the penalty area every time they cross the ball
8761809 for some reason within the mental capacity of my mind i thought it was best to play a weakened team
8761810 there were a lot of reserves involved when we lost i said to myself that wont happen again
8761811 and as players we didnt realise the importance of it to be honest we had an important league game a few days afterwards and that was the priority this time we havent so theres no excuse its a prestigious game and we want to win
8761812 but its also really important for us to get some players back on the pitch
8761813 european football must be clean and transparent and we do not want clubs buying success on credit
8761814 we have to find the golden mean the right balance
8761815 there have always been rich and poor clubs the rich get richer and the poor want to take their place we should have more balance and we will see what can be done but we will do it calmly and coolly with the whole football family
8761816 i am against technology video replays but with two more assistant referees it will deter cheating in the penalty area
8761817 when you have signed a contract you dont break it
8761818 so ronaldo did the right thing modern football is apparently about not respecting contracts and trying to make as much money as possible thats a pity
8761819 zero collateral damage is the goal we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we worked exceptionally hard to make sure it doesnt happen
8761820 ive got great commanders out there and its their they make these decisions and i am hard pressed to second guess what theyre doing with respect to that
8761821 im encouraged that hes taken action and i also think its going to take some time
8761822 we are making a major down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8761823 it is not even a beginning it is the continuation of a struggle that began centuries ago in lexington and concord in gettysburg and appomattox in farmville virginia and topeka kansas in philadelphia mississippi and selma alabama

8761850 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

8761880 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8761881 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8761882 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8761883 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8761884 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8761885 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8761886 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8761887 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8761888 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8761889 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8761890 its a big step to actually put it out there

8761894 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8761895 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different

8761904 hi is this mr bill johnson of 149 elmwood drive in albany
8761905 this is detective schifferbreins with the boston police department we recovered some shell casings at the scene of our citys latest homicide and we traced them back to the smith amp wesson 45 caliber handgun you reported stolen five years ago
8761906 i know its this great new microstamping technology that made it all possible
8761907 so you were able to catch the bastard who broke into my house raped my wife and stole my guns while i was out of town
8761908 oh well did you catch the shooter from the homicide youre investigating
8761909 but you have a good idea who it was right
8761910 oh well when you do can i have it back
8761911 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8761912 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8761913 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8761914 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8761915 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8761916 he was brilliant but the thing im trying to tell matty and drum into him and the young players is thats great to be on top of a wave but youve got to try to get to that level where youre cool youre calm and youre responsible and you deliver day in and day out
8761917 i had a long breakfast with matty this morning and hes in a really good place at the moment when he was left out he didnt open his mouth or anything he just went back to the drawing board at sussex and has done a fantastic job there
8761918 hes turned up back here with us as a different bloke and hes been brilliant fair play to the guy because he could have gone away and felt sorry for himself but hes gone away and scored hundred after hundred for sussex
8761919 i was pleased he finished not out with six catches its brilliant because it has been a headache for however long with our wicketkeeper but lets hope it stays good because hes a hell of a batsman
8761920 receiving this recognition from inc is an affirmation of our corporate goals to improve the business of leasing apartments for property owners and managers while helping consumers enjoy the best online experience
8761921 more importantly this award is a tribute to the real estate investment trusts apartment property owners and managers who make up our base of customers and who believe in what we were doing to create efficiencies for their leasing offices and for their valued renters
8761922 this is additional evidence to the failure of the security approach adopted by europe as a solution to illegal immigration
8761923 europe has slotted immense funds for this approach which could have paid the debts of the countries of the south
8761924 there are no laws in the countries of the south that sufficiently protect the victims many of whom are young people
8761925 a stigma for some of the souths regimes and governments
8761926 and we find the laws drafted in europe as well as the funds are directed against the victims of immigration
8761927 the security approach including the radars the logistical means and the plans set by europe are not directed towards the illegal immigration mafias
8761928 mtv is proud to be teamed up with lifebeat again on this years vma weekend as we support their long standing commitment to hiv aids education and prevention
8761929 we have always seen the lifebeat benefit as one of the cornerstones of the weekend and this years event is no exception
8761930 by bringing rock band and lifebeat together we hope to unleash the power of one of the biggest video game launches this year to benefit a fantastic and worthy cause
8761931 hiv aids remains a major epidemic in america with over 56 000 new cases diagnosed each year and half of those infections occurring in americans under 25 making it more important than ever to reach young audiences
8761932 this annual event offers a great opportunity to further our goals and mission
8761933 where it takes place in canada or elsewhere all of these places have publics who can be intimidated whether by bringing down canadian airplanes setting off bombs in nightclubs or tube stations in london burning down schools in afghanistan so girls cant get an education
8761934 it makes no difference in law whether the public or government sought to be intimidated is in canada or is anywhere else in the world
8761935 that would have to be established by evidence and there isnt any up to this point
8761936 burning and looting were continuing this morning women are being molested and brutalised and extremists are doing what they want with them
8761937 there will be lots of glass to help promote the aquatics center as a vibrant and active space
8761938 and this is obviously the opposite of the muslim womens requirements
8761939 to cover the pool windows with this type of automatic blind will be costly probably in the thousands of dollars
8761940 i have asked for an estimate and im hoping we will be able to get a sponsor who will consider providing funds for these blinds in lieu of an acknowledgment of their contribution
8761941 our sagacious leaderships initiative to set up an official ifta centre is a step in the right direction to promote noble traits in the community since the centre will receive inquiries from the public in arabic english and urdu on all religious social economic and trading issues
8761942 according to islam and according to kuwaits traditions women must wear the hijab
8761943 in a democracy such as kuwait the hijab cannot be imposed
8761944 most of all they need somebody to speak with imams must therefore be open to listen to homosexual muslims we recommend that everybody respect homosexuals and lesbians
8761945 it isnt possible to live homosexually and at the same time say that one practices islam these are two incompatible things
8761946 no homosexuality goes against what islam stands for and therefore it cant be combined
8761947 the imams should listen to homosexuals and to their concerns but naturally we will also inform them about islamic thought and how it relates to homosexuality
8761948 i dont want to speak of curing or that homosexuality is an illness as an imam i will note that every muslim should live in conformity to basic islamic principles
8761949 we stress that the islamic council of norway rejects the death sentence for homosexuals in norway but we dont want to go into legislation in other countries
8761950 as said the islamic council cant get involved in how other countries are run
8761951 he he no ive heard much about it and it was certainly not so clever of me
8761952 im sorry for what happened and if she ever wants to return to our museum she will be more than welcome
8761953 it is important to have a muslim statesman as the countrys national leader we will promote this idea not only to the president but also to anyone willing to offer himself as the future leader
8761954 the country is in need of a leader who is not just a politician or the chairman of a political party we need a statesman who can take on great responsibility for the sake of the countrys development
8761955 our idea is purely a suggestion we think all future leader hopefuls will accept this idea because islam is a rahmatan lil alamin blessing for the universe
8761956 for the president having muslim statesmen is good for the country good manners and ethics in politics and statesmanship should be upheld by whoever leads the country
8761957 he never tried to curb alis inclinations which was largely good
8761958 i think he genuinely cared about ali but he was also interested in making money for himself
8761959 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phone sales in both mature and emerging markets
8761960 consumers in mature markets continued to favor mid tier devices over high end devices while new subscribers continued to join mobile networks in emerging markets during the quarter however replacement sales remained weak as consumers faced higher prices for fuel and food in addition to higher levels of inflation
8761961 according to the lausanne treaty the founding document of modern turkey all the holy synod assembly members have to be turkish
8761962 if the foreign members of the assembly attend the meeting in istanbul the lausanne treaty would be violated
8761963 we have the right to invite any members to the holy synod meeting as the synod does not have a legal status and personality to be recognized by turkey
8761964 in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users it is not the network that is fault but the interaction of the bad power control algorithm in 2 0 and 2 0 1 software and the network that is at fault the sooner everybody is running 2 0 2 software the better things will be
8761965 a method and system in a document viewer for scrolling a substantially exact increment in a document such as one page regardless of whether the zoom is such that some all or one page is currently being viewed
8761966 in one implementation pressing a page down or page up keyboard key button allows a user to begin at any starting vertical location within a page and navigate to that same location on the next or previous page
8761967 for example if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom a page down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page similar behavior occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row
8761968 the entire xxxxxxxxx catalog is updated every 9 to 11 days
8761969 a lot more active crysis players than there were unit sales
8761970 then they were a sale that didnt happen but probably would have had it not been possible to obtain the game illegally
8761971 for example the consoles themselves are in one sense simply very good drm technologies that consumers welcome and pay for in order to receive the benefits that come with them
8761972 we want to continue to provide our fans in the pc world a rich and engaging experience
8761973 my grandfather salvatore ferragamo began his career working in costume design for the american film company a precursor to twentieth century fox so it is only fitting that we carry on his name and our companys heritage by collaborating once again on a film from fox
8761974 i am particularly pleased to report excellent earnings and cash flow for our 2008 fiscal year

8761976 there are a number of significant events that will have an impact on our financial results for fiscal 2009
8761977 these include the financial effects of the bgs acquisition the timing of any sassa tender award and the development of certain international business prospects assuming that our current business activities will continue as usual and taking into account the significant contribution from our activities in ghana during fiscal 2008 we anticipate our fundamental earnings per share growth rate to exceed 15 for fiscal 2009 on a constant currency basis
8761978 know that this isnt just about turning red states blue
8761979 remember when you were small and had invisible friends i had invisible enemies
8761980 people are getting their understanding of the world from random lunatics riffing in their underwear rather than professional journalists with standards and passports

8761984 you run amusement rides you hired a level 2 sex offender how did that happen
8761985 i really couldnt tell you i put an ad in the paper he answered it i hired him
8761986 did you go to the sex offender website and see his name
8761987 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8761988 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8761989 the chinese definition of literacy is the ability to read and write at least 1500 chinese characters in 1949 when new china was founded the illiteracy rate was more than 80 by 1992 22 3 of adults in china were illiterate ten years later that proportion had dropped to 8 72 while 8 72 seems relatively small that translates into a total of 85 million illiterate people in china at the beginning of this century twenty million of them were between the age of 15 and 50 with 70 of the total number of illiterate people being women despite chinas huge recent economic expansion and the countrys trillion dollar plus foreign reserves the total amount of money allocated per year since 2000 to fight and eliminate illiteracy among 85 million people was just eight million yuan us 1 03 million education was worth a paltry 0 07 yuan per person an amount that would certainly not buy a book of lessons nor even a pencil or one single sheet of paper to write on small wonder then that by 2007 the number of illiterate people had not dropped it had risen since official figures were released after chinas last census in 2000 giving a base of 85 million illiterate people china has experienced an increase in illiteracy equal to the entire population of canada 30 million people becoming unable to read or write today 116 million people are unable to meet chinas definition of literacy
8761990 although not all would do so each and every citizen of these 116 million people is denied the opportunity to unleash their potential both for self and country simply through the malaise of illiteracy in order to put the size of these figures into perspective in the year 2000 11 3 of all illiterate people on the planet lived in china incredibly by 2005 that total had risen to 15 a full 40 of chinese people cannot speak mandarin and once again it is the countryside population rather than the city elite who suffer the isolating factor of speaking only your own dialect in a country of 1 3 billion people fractures the very nationhood of china this mosaic of language prevents the government from giving a clear message of unity to all citizens in addition the inability to speak a common language combined with the inability to read and write dooms chinas poor citizens to a life of very few opportunities
8761991 the set is designed to evoke the white house and the lincoln memorial not the acropolis
8761992 the blisters hurt a lot but i tried to forget them and concentrate on the game
8761993 the cure was worse than the disease then i took of a shoe and after i took it off things changed a bit i could run the court better

8762005 they ocelots used to range through texas and into arkansas and louisiana now the u s population confined to a thin band along the river is thought to number no more than 100 by cutting off gene flow and thereby causing inbreeding the border fence will almost certainly eliminate all three cats north of the border reducing our nations native cat species by half

8762008 nafta accelerated immigration from mexico in search of jobs q are undocumented immigrants necessary will americans work on a farm 10 hours in 105 degree weather for only 8 50 per hour a well first of all we have to understand why so many people came north of the border to seek work i talked about the connection between nafta trade and our immigration policies when nafta was passed there was an acceleration of immigration from mexico because people were in search of jobs they were told their wages were going to go up wages collapsed in mexico now there were many corporations north of the border who were ready to receive a supply of cheap labor we understand that so of course we need to provide people a path to legalization but if we do not look at nafta while were looking at immigration were going to keep having the same problems a new trade agreement with mexico that has those principles will help workers in mexico help workers in the us create conditions where we finally gain control of our economic destiny again
8762009 on the 1st of january 1994 the north american free trade agreement nafta between the usa canada and mexico came into effect

8762016 the progressive automotive x prize is bringing together some of the most inspiring and innovative minds in the world in a shared effort to break americas addiction to oil
8762017 this competition has caught the attention of every major auto manufacturer and we are confident that it will bring new visibility to a range of solutions from both established and emerging sources
8762018 last but not least i would be remiss in my reporting duties if i did not once again use this opportunity to comment on the dismal state of oversight of the mush sector municipalities universities school boards hospitals long term care facilities and childrens aid societies in the province have become almost a law onto themselves they have carved themselves a nice comfortable niche a zone of immunity against oversight it continues to baffle me that the provincial government can talk out of both sides of its mouth on this how can it assume control over badly managed areas of the mush sector while at the same time refusing to subject it to the checks and balances that could have potentially prevented scandals from developing in the first place
8762019 its appalling that cas executives in ontarios childrens aid societies spent money on luxury cars expensive meals and exotic trips while ontarios most vulnerable children were left in situations that could be dangerous to their health their development and even their lives the mcguinty liberals have failed to protect the most vulnerable children in this province by failing to provide independent oversight of cas and thats unacceptable
8762020 nearly every province in canada allows for independent oversight except ontario the mcguinty liberals are intent on denying children and their families this independent avenue of appeal and thats a real problem
8762021 senator mccain has a more radical anti choice position than even george w bush and were going to make sure that voters across the country understand that
8762022 this is just not an area where he has led
8762023 mccain has never been a leader in the fight against abortion he would not say so himself
8762024 people think because he is a maverick he must be moderate on these issues
8762025 on a wide range of issues that affect womens reproductive issues he has followed the conservative bush line and he has said that roe v wade should be overturned
8762026 john mccain has spent more than 25 years in washington voting against womens freedom and has pledged to appoint justices to the supreme court who will overturn roe v wade

8762151 after numerous discussions around the league we officially released marcus this afternoon
8762152 this is a painful day because of our affection for marcus who is certainly a class act
8762153 we did everything humanly possible to trade marcus which would have allowed him to play under the conditions of his contract with us unfortunately we werent able to make that happen
8762154 while this concludes one chapter with marcus and the saskatchewan roughriders we have discussed the possibility of him remaining with our organization in a different capacity
8762155 its also very possible marcus will choose to play for another team in our league regardless though of what decisions marcus and mona make we wish them and their family the very best

8762186 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8762187 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8762188 does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners
8762189 certainly its not going to bind a judge but it may create some pressure on other courts to take notice of the decision and a trend might begin
8762190 the record presented demonstrates that far from encouraging copyright infringement veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its website and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its website
8762191 in sum veoh has met its burden in establishing its entitlement to safe harbor for the alleged infringements here

8762204 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8762205 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8762206 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8762207 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies

8762233 were very very happy about our relationship with google and this makes sure that mozilla will be sustainable and thrive for quite a long time to come
8762234 we develop our product and technical direction as part of an open process unrelated to the search relationship with google we talk to google about the parts of the product that offer google services i e the firefox start page and the services they provide like anti phishing otherwise google does not have any special relationship to mozilla project activities
8762235 what does mozilla do with all that cash money if theyre non profit
8762236 mozilla uses the funds to pay staff support its bandwidth and hardware infrastructure and to distribute a number of grants
8762237 were very very happy about our relationship with google and this makes sure that mozilla will be sustainable and thrive for quite a long time to come
8762238 the deal will ensure that the non profit mozilla foundation will be able to continue with the development of firefox its mail client thunderbird and a number of other applications
8762239 the mozilla corporation abbreviated moco is a wholly owned subsidiary of the mozilla foundation that coordinates and integrates the development of internet related applications such as the mozilla firefox web browser and the mozilla thunderbird email client
8762240 any profits made by the mozilla corporation will be invested back into the mozilla project there will be no shareholders no stock options will be issued and no dividends will be paid the mozilla corporation will not be floating on the stock market and it will be impossible for any company to take over or buy a stake in the subsidiary
8762241 im a big fan of mozilla but one of the reasons they formed moco was so they wouldnt have to disclose how much theyre making off google
8762242 if i were them id be looking for deals with yahoo msn and ask just to diversify their revenue stream a bit
8762243 i wouldve thought the figure would be way higher than 57m considering they have 14 of the browser market

8762281 it is vital that children get the basics early in primary school but the results for seven year olds are flatlining
8762282 there must be a much greater focus on early identification of these problems and more one to one support for children with basic literacy and numeracy problems

8762316 we know what government and local authorities are doing to develop plans and policies for children living away from home or who are in care
8762317 now its time for children to give their verdict and convey how well they think these services are doing for them by monitoring their own care
8762318 politicians and people working in the care field are keen to focus on the actual outcomes of what they do for children
8762319 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general
8762320 sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
8762321 the two tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system
8762322 carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society
8762323 the committees excellent report lays bare the extent to which carers struggle to access the support they need while carrying out one of the most valuable jobs in our society

8762335 no estamos en contra de que se pague ese retraso tan importante pero lo que tambi n defendemos es que se haga un estudio para que se vean las carencias de personal de la polic a local de telde que motivan que se hagan tantas horas extraordinarias apostamos que no se siga igual sino que ese dinero se gaste en crear m s puestos de trabajo

8762364 i got out of bed and walked by myself today
8762365 it was hard but im making great progress and taking things one day at a time
8762366 im mad that i wont be able to play football again but ill get over it
8762367 i feel blessed truly blessed because ill be able to walk again and lead a normal life
8762368 the guys call me a lot that shows what footballs all about relationships that youll have for the rest of your life were a family and were going to stick by each other no matter what
8762369 im going to be okay i want them to focus on football this is an important season coach gary kubiak has them believing in each other theyve got a big game coming up against pittsburgh
8762370 i cant wait to get back to houston to see my guys i miss them so much ill be back sometime next week i cant wait

8762372 gagosian gallerys first exhibition in 2007 was a success and encouraged the gallery to come back this year with a more ambitious presentation
8762373 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8762374 we miss him being here he is an important voice in our party it is certainly a loss we have to look within ourselves in a moment of crisis when we have somebody of symbolic and strong value and leadership who takes a fall we have to continue moving forward with all of the values strengths priorities and leadership that he brought to the race we have to carry that forward far beyond this election season
8762375 the company had been holding what we would consider captive audience meetings where they are on company time they are paid but they are required to go to meetings this is going beyond the normal routine of intimidation now they are trying to deny workers rights at the ballot box and that is something we felt we could not allow to take place and had to let the world know this is happening in the countrys largest employer you are not allowed to tell your employees how they are supposed to vote it is the most sacred right in our democracy
8762376 weve met privately with obama about it and weve met privately with jason the senator brought jason on to manage the day to day war room operations of their message to illustrate contrast with john mccain we made it clear as did the senator that there were certainly differences of viewpoint between he and jason on a series of issues we believe that barack obama has stood firm and clear on our agenda and the wal mart workers agenda
8762377 absolute hogwash wal mart gets a pass because they pass along savings they are passing along poverty poverty to workers across the world who are producing their goods poverty to the people that are working in their stores representing them who are trying to make a living many of whom probably have multiple jobs to afford to raise their families you name it they find every way to cut corners and cut their workers out of their success
8762378 only one president was the son of two immigrant parents

8762383 once again the earth has become wicked and over populated and i see the end of all flesh before me build another ark and save two of every living thing along with a few good humans
8762384 im about to start the rain where is the ark
8762385 but things have changed i needed building regulations approval and ive been arguing with the fire department about the need for a sprinkler system my neighbours claim that i should have obtained planning permission for building the ark in my garden because it is development of the site even though in my view it is a temporary structure we had then to go through an appeals process for a decision then the department of transport demanded a bond be posted for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions to clear the passage for the arks move to the sea i told them that the sea would be coming to us but they would hear nothing of it getting the wood was another problem all the decent trees have tree preservation orders on them and we have to apply for a felling licence to chop down the remaining ones we live in a site of special scientific interest set up in order to protect the spotted owl i tried to convince the environmentalists that i needed the wood to save the owls but no go when i started gathering the animals the rspca sued me they insisted that i was confining wild animals against their will they argued the accommodation was too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space i pointed out it would be even more cruel and inhumane to leave them to drown but again they were having none of it then the county council the environment agency and the rivers authority ruled that i couldnt build the ark until theyd conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood im still trying to resolve a complaint with the equal opportunities commission on how many disabled carpenters im supposed to hire for my building team the trade unions say i cant use my sons they insist i have to hire only accredited workers with ark building experience to make matters worse customs and excise seized all my assets claiming im trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species so forgive me lord but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark
8762386 you mean youre not going to destroy the world after all
8762387 i didnt know if i wanted to do that or not
8762388 i thought what have i got to lose its my right to do that as an american citizen
8762389 a lot of the young people with whom im working went double barreled into it the campaign
8762390 i thought if the young people are seeing something here and these are young kids immersed in catholic theology and social teaching then theres something to this
8762391 the idea was they wanted to mobilize catholic faith communities across the nation for obama
8762392 speaker pelosis outrageous attempt to present what she considers the teaching of the catholic church regarding abortion is simply wrong and should be disregarded by every faithful catholic
8762393 the teachings of the church on abortion are consistent and unambiguous and it is very disturbing to hear someone who claims to be a catholic distort these teachings and sow seeds of confusion among the faithful by attempting to relativize the right to life
8762394 house speaker nancy pelosi stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8762395 azuela was the only one who brought medical and scientific questions to the discussions aimed at defining when life begins
8762396 the question was avoided by the ten other justices who concluded that it was not for the court to determine when life begins since it is a question about which there is no agreement throughout the world and is not a legal question
8762397 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more sen
8762398 these challenges are not all of governments making obama plans to say
8762399 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w
8762400 i think its time we taught them a lesson about how to organize and win elections plouffe told the audience starting to assemble on the field this afternoon
8762401 youve helped us respond to the sleaze coming from john mccain and his campaign plouffe told the crowd the manager suggesting that this gathering was emblematic of the enlistment of voters which obama plans to make the core of his campaign for the white house
8762402 were going to undertake a voter registration drive the likes of which american politics has never seen
8762403 i have a dream speech 40 years ago on the national mall in washington will address the audience here so will rev bernice king his sister
8762404 job well done even in the midst of a bruising campaign in which the mccain campaign accuses obama of being
8762405 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to obama plans to say according to excerpts of his speech released
8762406 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8762407 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8762408 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more the nominee plans to say
8762409 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8762410 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8762411 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8762412 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8762413 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8762414 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8762415 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8762416 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8762417 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8762418 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8762419 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8762420 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8762421 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8762422 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8762423 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8762424 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8762425 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8762426 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
8762427 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8762428 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8762429 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8762430 there needs to be more targeted hiv prevention programs the kinds of prevention and treatment programs that really get at the underlying factors which are contributing to the spread of hiv
8762431 the news today is alarming particularly since the mayor and the city council have approved a 5 5 million cut in hiv services
8762432 you have to be brave in doing this kind of report because people will say where was the health department
8762433 this is going to cause them a lot of grief because people are used to talking about new diagnoses
8762434 mommy on my first day will you kiss my palm so i feel warm all day

8762447 because of the extensive and detailed nature of judge millers ruling the university is optimistic that the court of appeal will very quickly clear the way for construction to begin
8762448 we are eager to see the legal questions in this case resolved by the appellate court because the lower courts opinion created some serious questions marks we are obligated to take this case to the higher court for resolution
8762449 our case is fundamentally sound and we are confident that the court of appeal will reverse the lower courts position

8762461 we recognize the vast creative talent that went into these classic animations and hope that they will not only entertain but will also inspire the vuze audience to create compelling new high resolution content

8762470 as a stroke specialist at two hospitals and a university it is frustrating to see people disabled or even dying from avoidable stroke
8762471 if we were giving coumadin to all the people that should be on this anticoagulant we would reduce the amount of fatal and disabling stroke by at least 20 and often more we have a gap between 20 years of compelling evidence about what we should do and what we actually do in treating the high stroke risk in atrial fibrillation
8762472 that is not concordant with the american college of cardiology recommendations
8762473 the acc recommends that for low risk patients you could actually use aspirin because their lifetime stroke risk is about twice the normal risk but high risk patients should be on coumadin because their stroke risk is 8 to 9 and coumadin could reduce it to 4

8762481 what the food bank does for the community keeps growing
8762482 theres 185 000 children who are in need of food and this tournament right here we provide one million meals for them half of those kids are under 5 they cant support themselves and its important that we give back support the cause and try to provide nutrition for them
8762483 shes in tears up to three times a day and so tired that brads found her collapsed asleep in the bath twice shes been working around the clock breast feeding the babies and trying to get them to sleep but as soon as one of them drops off the other wakes up for another feed shes also not eating very much right now and blames that on being busy the doctor says that she needs more calories to gain strength and ensure that her breast milk is healthy
8762484 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8762485 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8762486 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8762487 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8762488 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8762489 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8762490 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8762491 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8762492 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8762493 there is no need to make it easy for outsiders to gain intelligence by looking at browser data this is a neat concept
8762494 i hope they make it tunable looks like 10 sites need to track you before ipb kicks in it should be settable it would be nice if it links into some sort of reputation based system to help give blocking suggestions
8762495 well have to wait until ie8 ships before we can truly see how well microsoft has implemented these privacy features some of which are already present in alternative browsers like apples safari
8762496 its clear that there will be people keen to use them
8762497 enabling users to be in control starts with making users aware of the issues
8762498 were certainly seeing a dip the question is is it a dip thats bouncing back again or it could be the start of a real drop
8762499 i was talking to somebody in the nfu and they were saying its happening in beef and everywhere because at the end of the day its a nice to have not a need to have
8762500 i predict demand will plateau a bit but not decline
8762501 these values are important to people still the concern about the way we farm the way the countryside is under threat at times about animal welfare
8762502 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8762503 it is calm and safe i had no fear about bringing my wife and children
8762504 the truth is that the tories change in language has touched a nerve reflecting a big gap in our own political narrative yet beneath camerons rhetoric lies the basic philosophy that failed britain in the past the tories demand responsibility without offering support they appeal for fraternity without any real belief in equality they have finally noticed society but remain implacably hostile to the state
8762505 the political language deployed by the opposition should also prompt us in the labour party to refresh our core story after 11 years in government
8762506 the danger is that we spend too much time emphasising what works and not enough making the case for what matters this is a trap all governing parties face even ken livingstone the archetypal insurgent became weighed down by incumbency in seeking a third term in office
8762507 the next agenda must be forged through starting with the pressures and the struggles that people face in their own lives at its most basic this means a clearer story about two things the limits of the market and the new frontiers of the welfare state old labour was hostile to the market new labour has arguably been too deferential to it
8762508 protection of fundamental characteristics of the republic cannot be considered an intervention in domestic politics
8762509 imaginary scenarios aim to bring down the reputation of the turkish armed forces
8762510 all attacks on our ability to perform our duties are bound to disappear in the face of our resolve
8762511 laws that are amended as if there is no terrorism threat against our country prevent the security forces from fighting terrorism in a rapid and effective manner
8762512 if terrorists are threatening human rights we need to reconsider the balance between rights and freedoms and take counter measures
8762513 but theres also speculation about what akp will do will it become more moderate or try again to impose islamism
8762514 the military are giving them the message that they are still here and prepared to defend secularism
8762515 there is real frustration within the military at what they see as an assault by the akp on ataturks secular legacy and also what they consider to be the political motivations of the ergenekon investigation they think the aim isnt to unearth the deep state but to undermine the military as an institution
8762516 the fiction looks brilliantly varied but once again it seems to be non fiction that is particularly ambitious and unafraid of scaling the really big themes of history culture and society
8762517 he liked to live life big with holidays and cars
8762518 fire crews have been damping down hotspots to bring the temperature low enough for structural work to begin it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined this is not something which can be done quickly once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8762519 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers she is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well
8762520 my case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8762521 long honourable and occasionally blood stained record on the championing of diversity
8762522 in short i think it is long past time we shut up stop making public statements about a private dispute and get on with the job we are paid to do
8762523 i do not think it was appropriate for this matter to be conducted in such a public way
8762524 di aggiungere consistenza sfumature a tutti i personaggi e agli sfondi
8762525 altri dettagli visibili saranno le foglie con le quali stata imbalsamata sallie e gli insetti allinterno di mr babau
8762526 il personaggio di oogie allinizio non era cos importante o malvagio nello sviluppo della storia per ho sentito la necessit di renderlo fisicamente pi grande e pi importante alla fine stata la canzone di danny elfman oogie boogie song a determinare il suo ruolo come cattivo e a presentare jack come eroe incauto
8762527 if the government soldiers or ethiopians suspect that you support al shabaab fighters from the islamist wing they will kill you in the street and vice versa
8762528 even if we have nothing else here we have security there is a dark future for somalia
8762529 ethiopia and the us have to think quickly about how they want to respond
8762530 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items
8762531 retail conditions have been extremely tough this summer and the wet august has been a further blow sadly no let up is expected as we head into early autumn the business outlook is particularly weak and retailers are having to scale back their employment and investment plans in an attempt to ride out the storm
8762532 augusts cbi distributive trades survey makes for pretty grim reading not least because the reported sales balance fell to yet a new record low and the surveys been going since the early 1980s suggesting that conditions on the high street are even worse than in the previous recession even a near term cut in interest rates wont bail out the economy over the next few months indeed we now expect both consumer spending and overall gdp to fall next year
8762533 this improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence such as cheaper petrol offers summer holidays happening or just a general feeling of things cant get any worse can they in particular winning gold medals in the olympics seems to have had a lifting effect when we looked at the index score before and after the olympics weekend the score rose 3 points between the first and second weekend this combined with summer holiday euphoria may have helped lift consumers perceptions of their personal situation and the general economy
8762534 i was always noticeable and i always knew i was different
8762535 i did get some bullying at school because i was different because i was brown but a lot of other kids were bullied as well if you were a bit too tall a bit too small
8762536 one of the key political moments was thatchers right to buy council house policy i remember the excitement that went round that neighbourhood seeing people contemplating ownership after a lifetime of renting
8762537 my children werent babies any longer and the practice had become established
8762538 i almost felt at last im ready for public service
8762539 it was almost looking in the biscuit barrel not liking the look of the biscuits and slamming the lid shut
8762540 i heard one of his speeches when he said he recognised there was a whole generation of people who worked hard who wanted nice things themselves but who also believed in social justice i thought thats me yes we are business people we do want to make money we do want to do well but we really care about looking after each other
8762541 i dont think im fearful of anything apart from possibly rats
8762542 im a careful person and there will be no complacency in my campaign im treating maidstone and the weald as if its a marginal and i will work as hard as i possibly can
8762543 im not bored or frustrated with it because i havent done it people have asked me to but i havent because in this first period i really wanted to focus on the constituency if im asked to comment in the future i will but i wont be the person always putting my hand up there are a lot of people who are diverse and of colour in the conservative party who may well have a different view from me
8762544 i do not believe for one minute that boris is racist
8762545 i believed hed do it and obviously my selection as the ppc for maidstone and the weald is evidence in many respects that that has happened
8762546 if were removing party politics completely just the man and what he has to offer and what hes doing at the moment for america i think he would make a very very good president
8762547 at the moment ive just got to be a hard working prospective parliamentary candidate getting elected and looking after the people of maidstone and the weald thats the job and thats what im determined to do
8762548 russia does not feel isolated and is not afraid to be isolated
8762549 thats a demonstration of complete confusion the product of a sick mind
8762550 will be to the detriment of the eu as much if not more than to russia i certainly hope reason and common sense will prevail
8762551 the essential aim of the summit following the latest russian declarations is to show europes unity and capacity to act balancing the need for dialogue and the need for firmness towards russia
8762552 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict to make the situation more tense and create a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8762553 this is a monumental moment in our nations history and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8762554 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8762555 there are plenty of mothers who arent very well educated who provide a great home environment and conversely some highly educated parents who dont provide such a good home environment
8762556 i simply didnt believe in the innocence of the hero
8762557 there is no way the son of a high ranking nazi officer wouldnt know at least something of what was going on in berlin and later on in the camp i didnt buy shmuels ignorance about the fate of the camps inmates
8762558 i experienced my most radical moments of happiness in the concentration camp you cannot imagine what its like to be allowed to lie in the camps hospital or to have a 10 minute break from indescribable labour to be very close to death is also a kind of happiness just surviving becomes the greatest freedom of all
8762559 id rather the star was on the tank than on my chest
8762560 we havent closed the gap in fact the gap has widened but the health of those who are most disadvantaged in life expectancy and infant mortality is at the same level as the rest of the population was eight years ago
8762561 the first thing is it is measuring and monitoring the problem we have really got as good a measure as any other country of the magnitude of the problem the fact that the government has had the courage to publish the bad news is important secondly we are taking it seriously the fact that we havent narrowed the gap means we have more work to do
8762562 toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8762563 in rich countries low socioeconomic position means poor education lack of amenities unemployment and job insecurity poor working conditions and unsafe neighbourhoods with their consequent impact on family life these all apply to the socially disadvantaged in low income countries in addition to the considerable burden of material deprivation and vulnerability to natural disasters
8762564 is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing conditions is low
8762565 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8762566 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small quarter point cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8762567 with the economy set to contract over the next year the outlook for the housing market remains bleak
8762568 what began as a fall in prices is fast becoming a housing crash the governments public dithering over whether to offer a stamp duty holiday is making a bad problem worse
8762569 compared with other forecasters nationwide is usually conservative in its predictions of house price falls so when it tells us there is a big fall we know something very serious is happening all the signs are that we are at the beginning and not the end of a very painful process rather than dithering over crackpot schemes to prop up the housing market the government must act to help the many thousands in danger of losing their homes
8762570 get your calculators out i know this is going to beep your horn
8762571 we are aiming to break into the mainstream of british society
8762572 we will be establishing city churches in manchester leeds and edinburgh
8762573 i have changed the landscape of the christian church in the uk
8762574 this has become a social force in the new europe but one that is usually marginalised and misunderstood
8762575 the growth of churches like kicc is because of the continuing influx of west africans it becomes a place where they can feel at home and every facet of human life is catered for and we should look at it as a very positive force for society
8762576 this is a place where people can feel a sense of connectedness and they use the pastors as mentors who they can look to for direction
8762577 we have career counselling legal guidance and marriage help we are making ourselves relevant to the community
8762578 pastor matthew ashimilowo is my motivator and an inspiration because of what god has done in his life
8762579 i have changed from knowing gang lifestyles now that i know god is preparing me to be a role model in the future
8762580 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me
8762581 ive bought a new car ive had a blood transfusion and ive booked our next summer holiday but dont worry ill be back in time for my 90th birthday
8762582 if we have any more violence we could withdraw the champions league final from rome its not an ultimatum just a message that we are keeping an eye on it
8762583 its not an easy draw for us and the overwhelming feeling after wednesdays game against standard li ge is that we are just happy to be involved
8762584 the tie against atl tico madrid is the one that stands out and will inevitably generate a lot of interest it will mean a lot to all the spanish players but especially torres
8762585 the pleasing aspect is that there will not be an awful lot of travel involved
8762586 given that our next two league games are away at liverpool and chelsea were particularly pleased that the game that falls between those two is at home against villarreal
8762587 in last weeks press conference i said i was less optimistic and im even less optimistic today
8762588 ive no idea whats going on its very hard to get communication with some people
8762589 the latest figures are excellent news for most passengers however the regular closure of parts of the network for engineering work causes substantial disruption and inconvenience to many passengers and freight customers as well as deterring others from using the network altogether
8762590 for rail to make its full contribution to our economy it is important that this disruption is reduced significantly we have been taking steps to ensure this happens
8762591 over the next five years nr must continue to carry out a full schedule of maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure together with a massive programme of enhancements to increase network capacity
8762592 we have been telling the industry for some time that passengers need accurate timely and coordinated information when engineering works take place
8762593 passengers recognise that engineering works are necessary and will tolerate some short term inconvenience for real long term gain but the rail industry should do more to inform passengers not only of the engineering works but also the benefits the work will bring
8762594 reducing disruption caused by improvement work is a central pillar of our plans in the years ahead delivering a railway at weekends to the standard we see during the week must be our goal and weve asked the orr for significant funds to make this seven day railway a reality
8762595 we are seeing the best levels of punctuality for 10 years with nine out of 10 trains running on time on many lines however we want to see further improvements and expect a major reduction in the delays which inconvenience rail users the most
8762596 we have been investing this year particularly behind the big four category leaders weve got smirnoff baileys bells and gordons
8762597 weve been working with the retailers to produce a shelf layout and a combination of products that works
8762598 our concern is that perceived defensiveness could be tested during the year to june 2009 given a 55 operating profit exposure to the problem housing market economies of the us uk spain and ireland together with increasing signs of slowing growth in certain emerging markets
8762599 ive bought a new car ive had a blood transfusion and ive booked our next summer holiday but dont worry ill be back in time for my 90th birthday
8762600 but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8762601 we need to boil that down we need to figure what changes have to be made to accommodate the concerns that are raised
8762602 theres been positive feedback but theres also been some adjustments that need to be made and we really need to sit down and talk about that and put our best foot forward
8762603 what are the adjustments that have to happen not to assume we got it all 100 per cent completely right
8762604 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8762605 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8762606 i absolutely do not believe this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators
8762607 certainly knowing there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops here
8762608 we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or canadian food safety system
8762609 cfia inspectors are on site every time the plant is operational they are in the plant they are there physically i understand every time the plant is running
8762610 the inspectors that are part of our union have expressed a concern that its simply keeping them too much off the facility floor where they used to actually get a chance to walk around and get a better feel for things
8762611 theyve introduced basically a documentation system that better tracks what activities take place both by the plant and by our members who inspect for the cfia
8762612 the system is supposed to make it more regimented make sure that everything happens in a particular fashion and from that perspective it would be good
8762613 added workload in terms of the documentation certainly doesnt have them feeling really comfortable about the amount of time they get to spend looking at things like sanitation and observing clean up procedures
8762614 because listeria is so widespread in our environment that root cause for certain is unlikely but they continue to seek it out at least to narrow it down
8762615 i never had an aspiration to look like a doll which is fortunate
8762616 red carpet dressing sounds like something that would take you out of your own instincts but havent gotten there yet i will wear what i want to wear
8762617 the motion academy of doo da what was it called
8762618 a lot of people really want one really really want one and im embarrassed because i never did and i feel a little ashamed that i was given one when i didnt really want one
8762619 there is a possibility for our generation point being that one doesnt necessarily have to give it all up one can actually stand up and be counted
8762620 well i fancy girls i dont know about lothario im 31 im single i havent been on a date in i cant remember how long five or six months and im still single so thats how well that date went im not a lothario god no
8762621 everyone always brings this womanising thing up but its not what im about im not a womaniser ive just told you i havent been on a date for five or six months is that the behaviour youd expect from a womaniser
8762622 i wish it was all true most of it is rubbish people ive supposedly been with thats not for me to talk about ive never talked about it pamela and i are friends i spoke to her recently if people want to assume ive been going out with her they can
8762623 im indifferent to it would it make my life easier if i could go out with my friends and not have people coming up to me and asking me really intimate things about supposed relationships ive had yes i could do without that but thats the business im in im not really fussed what people think of me
8762624 i work in tv because i just want to entertain if ive made someone laugh it makes me happy i wont rest until i am the best i can be
8762625 i had to go for an audition because i didnt know if i could act or not the part wasnt big so i thought i could do it i went along and there were other actors i recognised and i thought this is embarrassing because i was thinking they were thinking get out of here tv presenter boy i was so excited when i got it
8762626 it would be foolish to say im an actor now if anything happens great but if it doesnt thats fine
8762627 she proposed to me and i didnt think she would remember in the morning because we were in a bit of a mess she was a wonderful girl and i sometimes think i made a mistake it was either my career or her and i felt i was too young to settle down i was 22
8762628 she would always say we are engaged to be married thats the whole point of being engaged i drove her up the wall
8762629 but we were heavily into sport football and squash so it seemed the natural thing to do my mother only lived two miles away so we saw her a lot i had a good upbringing good parents
8762630 the people were wonderful but the job was hell on earth
8762631 being stuck there and knowing youre not supposed to be doing that but not knowing what you were supposed to be doing it was a tough time i wasnt happy i was drinking a lot and doing all the rest of the things you do when theres nothing to do in a valleys community like that
8762632 chris came off his bike and he died which was a horrific thing to go through i cant really put it into words
8762633 he lived next door to us his parents were our next door neighbours so we had known him all our lives he died there and then in my arms after that i went to a really dark place life without him was awful i was in this shithole factory about a year later my mate tricky said youve got to get out of this throw it all in and lets go travelling round the world so thats what we did everything changed then it was the best move i ever made that was the turning point where i thought ive got to do something with my life i like that pressure to make something of myself because chris was going to be something amazing he was a beautiful talented man twelve years on theres not a day that goes by when i dont think about him so when people talk about the flirting thing i really dont care what people say about me shit like that doesnt bother me because i know infinitely worse things can happen
8762634 it was and i took that lesson on thats why i live every moment as if its the last and thats why i enjoy myself i never make plans im living right now
8762635 then there was a real lull in my career and i wasnt willing to go to bars or stumble out of chinawhite with a page 3 model that wasnt me
8762636 well i only flirt with the people i fancy or if theres comedy
8762637 nobody wants to watch some guy going he puts on a sleazy voice do you like walks in the park do you like black and white movies although that would be quite funny actually it has to be comedy flirting i want people to think that steve jones is a cheeky bitch they get it these actresses even the guy actors i flirt with some of them for a laugh why not they play along
8762638 they will have to drag me kicking and screaming out of the channel 4 building throw me into the gutter chuck a binful of rubbish on top of me and say get lost youre not welcome i love that show and i will do it until i feel its wrong for me to be doing it any longer so no no plans to finish
8762639 im definitely too old to do it but unfortunately i think im getting funnier as i get older
8762640 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year
8762641 i just havent been scoring the way i would like even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week
8762642 it was a fun tournament last year and i loved the opportunity to have won the tournament
8762643 but i also love the way it happened with the opportunity to play three rounds with tiger
8762644 id be making half as much as i am now
8762645 im very thankful hes in our sport and hes had the success and the charisma and the lure to attract corporate america as well as fans to the game
8762646 you know that right you are playing left handed this week arent you
8762647 the key is going to be again scoring getting up and down around the greens that i miss and getting those birdie putts to drop
8762648 i suspect this crowd is going to be very surprised at how specific barack obama is going to be about his economic and social platform because much of it has been vague
8762649 much of what obama has been able to do so far has been carried forward by his charisma and his unique experience as the first african american nominated for president
8762650 everything ive learned in my eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8762651 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8762652 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it and change it is exactly what barack obama will do
8762653 as oil companies post the biggest profits in history nearly half a trillion dollars in the last five years john wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks thats not change thats the same
8762654 who cares if he is black his race is irrelevant
8762655 i was always noticeable and i always knew i was different
8762656 i did get some bullying at school because i was different because i was brown but a lot of other kids were bullied as well if you were a bit too tall a bit too small
8762657 one of the key political moments was thatchers right to buy council house policy i remember the excitement that went round that neighbourhood seeing people contemplating ownership after a lifetime of renting
8762658 my children werent babies any longer and the practice had become established
8762659 i almost felt at last im ready for public service
8762660 it was almost looking in the biscuit barrel not liking the look of the biscuits and slamming the lid shut
8762661 i heard one of his speeches when he said he recognised there was a whole generation of people who worked hard who wanted nice things themselves but who also believed in social justice i thought thats me yes we are business people we do want to make money we do want to do well but we really care about looking after each other
8762662 i dont think im fearful of anything apart from possibly rats
8762663 im a careful person and there will be no complacency in my campaign im treating maidstone and the weald as if its a marginal and i will work as hard as i possibly can
8762664 im not bored or frustrated with it because i havent done it people have asked me to but i havent because in this first period i really wanted to focus on the constituency if im asked to comment in the future i will but i wont be the person always putting my hand up there are a lot of people who are diverse and of colour in the conservative party who may well have a different view from me
8762665 i do not believe for one minute that boris is racist
8762666 i believed hed do it and obviously my selection as the ppc for maidstone and the weald is evidence in many respects that that has happened
8762667 if were removing party politics completely just the man and what he has to offer and what hes doing at the moment for america i think he would make a very very good president

8762674 harper began the tour in tuktoyaktuk with an announcement on arctic sovereignty essentially arguing canada should extend its jurisdictional reach into the arctic ocean doubling it from 100 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles
8762675 whether it is the thawing of the northwest passage or the suspected resource riches under the arctic seabed more and more countries are taking an interest in the waterways of the canadian arctic
8762676 we will be sending a clear message to the world that our environmental standards and sovereignty are not up for debate if you are in canadas arctic you will be playing by canadas rules
8762677 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8762678 i think everybody understands that canada has no particular power play here this is in the interests of order and also in the interests of environmental protection

8762713 during these times there is increased traffic and there appears to be an increase in impaired driving we dont want any fatalities any time we dont want people hurt or people killed in our county

8762715 obey all traffic laws and dont be in a hurry just be very cognizant of your surroundings and whats going on

8762730 in collapsing the distinction between international law and politics those who supported kosovos independence have opened a pandoras box of mutual recognitions and assertions of sovereignty with damaging repercussions for both regional and global security by discarding the ideas of compromise accommodation and reintegration support for dividing serbia as a solution to ethno national conflicts was both myopic and ill conceived
8762731 new recognition game of international politics is unlikely to end here with the aspirations of local ethnic majorities elsewhere fuelled by the kosovo case secessionist movements within and beyond the eus borders continue to insist that kosovo is a model for their respective causes
8762732 kouchners assertion that when two communities cannot speak to each other there is no choice but to separate them is not only blind to europes very own history principles and practices but also to efforts to build peaceful co existence throughout the western balkans

8762839 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8762840 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8762841 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8762842 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8762843 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more

8762848 antipsychotics are effective in treating potentially very distressing psychiatric symptoms but as with all drugs their use can be associated with a range of benefits and possible side effects
8762849 this study has further clarified the potential for antipsychotics to increase the risk of stroke
8762850 this risk is substantially higher in patients with dementia than those without these findings need to be factored into prescribing decisions made by doctors caring for patients with often distressing and difficult to treat psychiatric symptoms
8762851 we believe that the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided wherever possible
8762852 for other patients careful consideration must be given to the likely individual risks and benefits of any prescribing decision
8762853 important topic and elevates the concern about risks of antipsychotics to a whole new level the fda u s food and drug administration might investigate whether availability limitations or warning labeling should be imposed

8762974 abortion is still a hush hush issue in kenya but despite laws which restrict the termination of pregnancy illegal abortion continues in this east african nation unabated there are no easy answers to this emotive issue on the one side there are those who argue for the womans right to choose to have a baby or not while others using religion as the base argue for the rights of the fetus
8762975 o aborto um tema sobre o qual n o se fala abertamente no qu nia mas apesar das leis que restringem a interrup o da gravidez o aborto ilegal continua acontecendo cotidianamente continua acontecendo nesta na o do leste africano n o h respostas f ceis para esta quest o t o emotiva de um lado h aqueles que argumentam em favor do direito da mulher em decidir se deseja ou n o ter um beb enquanto outros usando a religi o como base argumentam pelos direitos do feto
8762976 kenyan doctors often take a very liberal approach to the interpretation of kenyas restrictive abortion policy with the knowledge that if they do not women will be forced to conduct unsafe abortions that place their lives at higher risk
8762977 m dicos quenianos muitas vezes tem uma vis o bastante liberal ao interpretar a restritiva legisla o sobre o aborto no pa s sabendo que se eles n o o fizerem as mulheres ser o for adas a conduzir abortos inseguros que colocam suas vidas em risco
8762978 kenya has one of the most restrictive abortion laws even as the rest of the world relaxes those laws yet abortion rates are increasing and becoming more dangerous as women take greater risks to complete their abortions a visit to ward 1d in kenya where women end after botched abortions is a sobering evidence of this im sure that there are legitimate reasons for restricting abortion the thing i dont understand is the hypocrisy by the government on this issue given these sobering statistics did you know that a person found helping to complete an abortion in kenya can be subject to capital punishment what about the men who forcibly rape young girls relatives and mentally retarded women all over the country
8762979 o qu nia tem um das leis do aborto mais restritivas do mundo enquanto o resto do mundo est relaxando suas legisla es sobre o assunto ainda assim a quantidade de abortos est aumentando e eles est o se tornando mais perigosos conforme as mulheres se arriscam cada vez mais para realizar seus abortos uma visita ala 1d no qu nia onde as mulheres acabam indo parar depois de abortos mal suscedidos uma evidencia muito esclarecedora disso eu estou certo de que possam haver raz es leg timas para se restringir o aborto o que eu n o entendo a hipocrisia do governo sobre esta quest o mesmo em vista destas impressionantes estat sticas voc sabia que uma pessoa descoberta ajudando a realizar um aborto no qu nia pode ser sujeita pena capital mas o que acontece com os homens que estupram jovens garotas parentes e mulheres com problemas mentais em todo o pa s
8762980 abortion in our country kenya is a never ending story first you have the police going after doctors who allegedly have performed the vice being imprisoned however the solution to the problem in my opinion is not to go after the doctors after all they are trying to get a sense of livelihood though through the wrong means as such i would go for pro life and pro choice let the pregnant couple decide what to do about their situation this will only be possible if abortion is legalised in kenya
8762981 o aborto em nosso pa s qu nia uma hist ria sem fim primeiro voc tem a pol cia indo atr s dos m dicos que alegadamente teriam realizado o crime e os prendendo contudo a solu o do problema na minha opini o n o se perseguir os m dicos afinal eles est o tentando ter sensibilidade em rela o vida mesmo que pelos meios errados ent o eu sou a favor do pr vida e do pr escolha vamos deixar que o casal gr vido decida o que fazer a respeito de sua situa o mas isso s seria poss vel se o aborto fosse legal no qu nia
8762982 the bill if passed will promote and allow easy access to abortion on demand with virtually no safeguards to protect unborn children under the subtle guise of reproductive rights language the bill declares safe and accessible abortion related care as a reproductive right abortion can be permitted provided that the continued pregnancy would pose a risk of injury to the womans physical or mental health this will in effect allow abortions on demand
8762983 a lei se aprovada ir promover e permitir o acesso f cil ao aborto quando se quiser com virtualmente nenhuma restri o para proteger as crian as n o nascidas debaixo do sutil disfarce da linguagem dos direitos reprodutivos a lei declara que o acesso seguro a cuidados relativos ao aborto seria um direito reprodutivo o aborto pode ser permitido contanto que a continua o da gesta o puder colocar em risco a sa de f sica ou mental da mulher isso ir com efeito permitir que se aborte quando quiser
8762984 recently the kenyan press sensationalized even using pictures the death of 15 fetuses apparently due to illegal abortions the public shrieked and public condemnation of abortion was rife but this response will not discourage the young women who saw no other choice open to them from repeating the act again
8762985 recentemente a imprensa queniana sensacionalizou usando at mesmo fotografias a morte de 15 fetos aparentemente por causa de abortos ilegais o p blicou gritou e a condena o p blica contra o aborto foi severa mas esta resposta n o ir desencorajar as jovens mulheres que n o tem outra escolha dispon vel para elas a repetir o ato novamente

8762987 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8762988 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8762989 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8763086 these workers are going to be very angry i think if we dont see this matter withdrawn then its likely therell be a meeting of these workers next week to give consideration to all sorts of things
8763087 this is something that wont be able to occur overnight
8763088 the union campaign is very well formed very well organised and i believe that we will have the support of the rest of the energy industry unions to oppose this campaign
8763089 the premiers had four inquiries hes done everything he can to meet the various requirements of a number of different stakeholders in the debate on each occasion his proposals have been given strong support and it seems we couldnt move forward
8763090 the premier and his decisive action has clearly demonstrated that hes putting the needs of the economy in terms of investment and jobs to the forefront in terms of energy supply to the forefront
8763091 we have state federal and we thought we had the rail operators commitment to a tripartite agreement on the expenditure of well in excess of 120 million
8763092 but weve always been led to believe as a business community that the state money is dependent on the federal and that both the federal money and the state money is dependant on the pacific nationals money or the rail operators money
8763093 now if the rail operator is now not bound under contractual arrangement then rail is back totally in the question mark for the state of tasmania
8763094 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming

8763247 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8763248 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8763249 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

8763260 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8763261 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8763262 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8763263 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8763264 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8763265 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8763266 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8763267 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8763268 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8763269 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8763270 an object in motion tends to stay in motion and an object at rest tends to stay at rest unless another force acts upon the object
8763271 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8763272 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8763273 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8763274 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8763275 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8763276 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8763277 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8763278 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8763279 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8763280 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter and there will likely be some non linearity in the improvements in our operating income margins as we rebalance our portfolio make cost improvements and drive growth

8763287 the skies are darkening and ominous new considerations are intruding on the politics of 2008
8763288 we havent faced a downturn like this since the depression
8763289 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8763290 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8763291 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8763293 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
8763294 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
8763295 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

8763300 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8763301 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8763302 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato

8763310 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
8763311 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

8763315 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
8763316 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
8763317 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti
8763318 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani
8763319 vi chiedo di farlo con gli occhi fissi al futuro nello spirito dellunit e con lo scopo della vittoria
8763320 obama dovr ricostruire il sogno americano e restituire allamerica il suo prestigio nel mondo
8763321 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8763322 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8763323 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8763324 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8763325 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica
8763326 hillary marted ha conquistato tutti e con bill avete visto cosa accade quando un presidente mette la gente al primo posto ci riprenderemo lamerica perch sono le persone normali a fare cose straordinarie

8763328 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8763329 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8763330 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8763331 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8763332 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8763333 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8763334 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8763335 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8763336 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8763337 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
8763338 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and
8763339 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8763340 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8763341 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8763342 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8763343 good question im getting the answer to that and i hope to have it by monday
8763344 i can tell you it has nothing to do with daniels view absolutely nothing out there
8763345 we want to be fully open and provide everything the answer is yes whatever we have were going to provide
8763346 at this point mr stilwell is not involved in these indictments what we are looking at is whether stilwell was factual to commissioner bigelow when asked about his land thats what we care about
8763347 if new facts come into play we need to investigate this board is prepared to do the right thing
8763348 lets develop a line of healthy products for kids on the go
8763349 with all the sophisticated knowledge of recent times no machinery has yet been developed that grinds grains into flour quite as well as our flint hard quartz millstones quarried in france and used by discriminating millers since early roman times
8763350 our well dressed sharpened sets of millstones turn the highest quality wheat into a finer better baking bread flour than all the hammer mills steel roller mills steel buhr mills or pulverizers ever built these slow turning millstones grind the bran endosperm and germ containing its nutritious wheat germ oil into flour in a cool natural way creating a more assimilable food
8763351 o pr sal propriedade de 190 milh es de brasileiros portanto vamos fazer com que essa riqueza oriunda da natureza possa favorecer n o apenas o conjunto da sociedade brasileira mas entre ela as pessoas mais pobres
8763352 a reserva imensa tem um potencial extraordin rio mas preciso deixar fazer todas as pesquisas que t m que ser feitas at que comecemos a explor la
8763353 eu acho que temos que trabalhar com muito carinho sobre o que vamos fazer com o resultado deste petr leo para que o brasil saia ganhando como um todo
8763354 lets develop a line of healthy products for kids on the go
8763355 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8763356 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8763357 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8763358 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8763359 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8763360 we are pleased to bring such a high caliber individual onto executive team
8763361 mark is a seasoned executive with experience at publicly held hardware and software companies and he brings a strong financial and accounting foundation which we are confident will benefit the company and our investors
8763362 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8763363 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8763364 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8763365 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8763366 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8763367 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8763368 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8763369 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8763370 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8763371 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8763372 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8763373 who are open to doing something on the production side
8763374 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8763375 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8763376 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8763377 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8763378 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8763379 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8763380 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8763381 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8763382 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8763383 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8763384 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8763385 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8763386 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8763387 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8763388 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8763389 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8763390 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8763391 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8763392 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8763393 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8763394 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8763395 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8763396 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8763397 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8763398 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8763399 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8763400 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8763401 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8763402 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8763403 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8763404 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8763405 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8763406 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8763407 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8763408 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8763409 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8763410 vote for me because im not a republican and all your woes are their fault
8763411 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8763412 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8763413 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8763414 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8763415 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8763416 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

8763448 the bottom line is i dont condone the lifestyle and what they were asking me to do in my official capacity as mayor was to issue a proclamation which in essence endorsed the gay lifestyle
8763449 if i had issued such a proclamation i would in essence be saying that gods position is wrong and i wouldnt dare take a position against god so as opposed to suing me they need to be suing god and the last time i checked he can defend himself end of story
8763450 we want him to be ordered to treat cap the same as anybody else
8763451 if not i am going to sue them for harassment
8763452 get up on the bed with your head on the pillows

8763459 you shall not be afraid of the terror by night nor of the arrow that flies by day nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness nor the destruction that lays waste at noonday
8763460 for god has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
8763461 be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god
8763462 okay how about you tell me what happened and ill give you a note to go back to class
8763463 without it i dont know what kind of person i might have become but im not sure i like the person i am now racing makes me selfish irritable defensive if i could get out of this sport with any ego left i would
8763464 i became hypersensitive to the danger and wasnt sure that i wasnt going to kill myself
8763465 the strain of inactivity was worse than the strain of driving
8763466 i never in my life experienced anything so profoundly mournful
8763467 i had a very exciting life and learned an awful lot about myself and others that i might never have learned racing sort of forced a confrontation with reality lots of people spend their lives in a state that is never really destined to go anywhere
8763468 ed was happy as a lark until it started to leak like a sive
8763469 theres a curious thing about pain or hardship in the beginning its an enemy its something that you dont want to face or deal with yet with time it becomes almost a friend
8763470 he wasnt no good always smiling in some woman face look at him feeding off the attention any woman give him
8763471 he just like all the rest i thought he was gone be different
8763472 dime de qu co o sirve si tu ya no est s
8763473 its great to be here tonight you know i think by far the most critical issue to the future of our traditions to the future of hunting and fishing is whether the next generation participates in hunting and fishing we all know there are those moments when we became sportspeople we became sportsmen and sportswomen when our parents connected us to that and there is that spark when that happens that takes things to the next generation i remember a couple of months ago i dont get out as often as id like to get out these days but i usually make it a priority to get out during hunting season and i try to make sure that my kids and my wife get out even when im stuck in the office i was sitting in the office one day and my son came back from his school field trip and he came in my office and he had the biggest smile on his face that id seen in days he came over and gave me a hug and took off his backpack and he unzipped it and pulled out a ziplock bag with a big trout inside the pride i could see on his face was something that i know hes going to grow up valuing these things and i think personally that we need to move away from failed policies like no child left behind and take more of a no child left inside approach to our kids and to make sure that all of our kids growing up in public schools have some access to the outdoors and get exposed to those things because without that i dont these traditions will survive if we dont pass them to the next generation i also think its incredibly important that we protect and conserve our habitat and our public lands and access to those public lands i dont know about you but ive had the experience of trying to go someplace that ive been before and running into a locked gate for the first time on what used to be a maintained county road we really need to make sure that our federal lands are open to the public finally i am going to say something that seems a little out of what youd expect for a forum like this but i think its important that we restore our economy and that we have a middle class tax cut because there are so many families today struggling who are trying to pick up an extra few hours on saturday an extra few hours on sunday at their job and they are not getting out with their families the way my parents took me during the summers to go camping during the fall to go hunting and we need to make sure that we preserve those traditions
8763474 first of all i know bob very well so im going to adhere to that three minutes because i know hes a pretty good shot and if he got really angry he might just take me out but he also knows that im usually armed myself so it could get a little ugly first of all let me thank all of the sponsors involved and bob as well for putting this on i too grew up in upstate new york my father was a registered nurse who worked midnights and when i would come home form school my father was just getting up and he would take me hunting he would take me fishing and he taught to me the fundamental rights of being a good hunter a good fisherman and of course protecting our land and ensuring it for future generations now unfortunately the way my schedule works i dont have much time for hunting wildlife anymore most of it is consumed hunting bad guys thats still a lot of fun and has a lot of the same characteristics to it but i wish i could do more of it my top three priorities for our youth are obviously protecting the land the air and the water and ensuring that we do provide for that access to hunting for future generations to come second of all and i think very important preserving our second amendment rights which is something i have done my entire life is fought for our second amendment rights i think its also important that we continue to educate our children and mentor them like my father did as a small boy again critically important that they understand at a young age i dont see the generations to come experiencing it the way that we did when you look at some of the statistics its somewhat frightening its very very unfortunate so what do you do in congress well first and foremost as i said you continue to stand up for our second amendment rights critically important and also provide for those opportunities for fishing and hunting so that the future of new mexicans is preserved for generations to come also when i talk about educating our children ensuring that they understand that hunting and fishing and being part of the outdoors is a critical component of who we are as a nation its a critical component of our way of life and that should be taught in every one of our schools as well thank you very much
8763475 thank you bob i believe that the right to keep and bear arms is an individual right i agree with the supreme court when they struck down the d c gun ban i think people have a right not just to own firearms but to be able to protect themselves and you know it sometimes surprises people because ive got that d behind my name im a democrat but im also a member of the nra and when the nra banquet was held a few weeks ago darren was there i was there too in fact i came away about 500 poorer dont tell my wife for bidding on a blackpowder 54 caliber rifle its really important to us in the west what firearms mean for our culture like probably a lot of you ive got more guns than i own but less than i need i think its something that is important for many people as apart of being a new mexican also part of being an american i think we have plenty of laws on the books today regarding gun ownership i think what we need more of is more aggressive enforcement more resources for enforcement so that when somebody uses a firearm in the commission of a crime that we throw the book at them and i think thats the approach that i would advocate taking when it comes to our second amendment and constitutional rights
8763476 as i said in my opening statement this is something i feel very strongly about
8763477 ive got a bill that im introducing which is concealed carry and there hasnt been one secretary of dps or anyone from the state police whose been willing to back me to come in and testify for this bill
8763478 well thats where it ends right now because i will be in there testifying as a law enforcement officer this was a tough decision because many of the law enforcement organizations and many of the law enforcement officers that i served with were opposed to concealed carry and i respected them for that decision but i also knew as a law enforcement officer that we cant be on every street corner we cant be there every time that something happens to someone so who am i to say that you dont have that right to protect yourself unfortunately it took more than that year to pass that bill but every year that i was up there for five years i supported the concealed carry and i was very happy to see it finally pass and become law now when i became sheriff and the law passed it was a problem they were having a difficult time with the background check the state special investigations division thats responsible for doing the background checks couldnt do it so i volunteered our agency to help with those background checks so that the applications could be expedited and people could get their concealed carry licenses as quickly as possible as i also said i am very very proud that in my two elections i have been supported and endorsed by the nra its something i was very proud of martin brought up the washington d c case and i too supported that decision i felt it was very important but you know what upset me about that decision there are four supreme court justices who felt that you do not and i do not have the right to bear arms thats scary folks we were one vote away from a critical landmark decision that could have impacted our right to bear arms we are one vote away and that scared me and i will do everything in my power as a congressman to ensure that all rights gun owners rights are preserved
8763479 i dont think its adequate though i commend all sportsmen for being willing to make sure that we all take an active role in ensuring those wildlife populations i think we need to have some initiatives at the federal level to help what happens at the state level with the department of game and fish all across the country one of the things i would do is there is funding called the land and water conservation fund in congress and what typically happens is that these are monies that are already collected they go into the land and water conservation fund and then congress raids them for other activities they are for the acquisition of habitat i think we ought to put a lock box on the land and water conservation fund but we also ought to allow those fund not just for the acquisition of habitat but also for the maintenance of that habitat for wildlife programs in conjunction with state game and fish departments to put more wildlife emphasis on our public lands across the country i also think that as we proceed in responsible common sense energy production from our public lands that there ought to be a responsibility to restore those lands when were done utilizing them for the production of energy that those lands ought to become quality habitat again and that means best practices restoration work finally i think we need to reform the 1872 mining act and use a portion of those public resources the benefits from them to make sure that we have adequate wildlife funding and restoration funding across the west
8763480 just as martin said the pittman robertson act has provided billions of dollars for protecting our wildlife and our wilderness areas and its been very very critical and very very important and i commit to you that i will do everything in m power to keep it strong i think that looking at some of the other programs the educational programs that it funds as well as shooting ranges is critically important as well but one of the things that i have learned in working with the federal government in a variety of different federal programs is that you always have to go back and evaluate for programmatic compliance is the money thats being taken from these excise taxes being used exactly for what it was intended obviously a few years ago congress learned because a few people like you all stood up and said much of this money is being used for frivolous administrative costs and action was taken to stop that and thats important just because a few years has passed doesnt mean that you dont go back and ensure that that program is being administered properly because i will assure you if you dont keep a close eye on it you will be surprised by what you find the dispersement to the states as well needs to be reviewed we currently derive this money from the number of hunting licenses sold the formula itself that are purchased in the state i think we also need to take a hard look at the number of hunting days that each state is involved in when we look at the dispersements to the states and i think we would find that there is a disparity that should be addressed i also think that we should look at individual programs as well congress is incredible at wasting a lot of money if you have millions of dollars to build a woodstock museum how come you dont have millions of dollars to protect our wildlife so its something that i will be a strong advocate for and ensure that those dollars are being spent responsibly i often say that congress spends like drunken sailors i think thats an insult to drunken sailors drunken sailors pay their own way and sometime during the night they get cutoff but congress never does they just keep spending and spending on some of the most ridiculous things i have ever laid my eyes upon but this is important its important to our families its important to our way of life and it should be funded
8763481 you know when i started my campaign for congress back in october there were a number of issues that were first and foremost on the minds of the voters
8763482 i would agree with darren that people are struggling and this is a critical issue you know we just had an economic forum a few weeks ago where i talked to a mother of four named kara compton who had just filled up her van and it cost her 100 to fill up her van and she was making some difficult decisions about how to spend what was left of her budget for the next two weeks because of that and so we need an energy plan that addresses short term supply we need to crack down on the kind of manipulation that has driven the commodities prices particularly oil and gas through the roof we need to release a portion of the strategic petroleum reserve some people say thats only for emergencies the last time i checked with people dealing with these gas prices a lot of them think its an emergency and in the long run we need to expand domestic production as well but i dont think that we need to take the raton basin for example its millions of acres we can develop the vast majority of those oil supplies without going in and sacrificing new mexicos yellowstone i think it was one of the best pieces of legislation i have seen in a long time to see the valle vidal protected in a bipartisan way that i know i worked very hard on and a lot of people in this room worked very hard on i dont think that we need to sacrifice the kind of traditions that go on at the valle vidal with those boy scouts with the when i used to run an educational foundation that did outdoor science education we used to send kids to the valle vidal and they would come back awestruck with that special place so we can develop our energy resources without going into our most precious places we dont need to destroy the best antelope habitat in new mexico to develop the vast majority of the oil in the permian basin and when we do develop oil and gas we can do it in a responsible way we can do it in ways that use best practices to particularly adjust seasonal use to make sure that wildlife is taken into account when these decisions are made when you dont do that winter habitat goes away habitat security goes away we need to make these decisions with our wildlife in mind
8763483 i absolutely believe that wilderness and roadless are important for sportsmen their important for certain species that need that kind of habitat security from big horn sheep to rio grande cutthroat trout to elk
8763484 start off just by saying since this is our last question its important that we recognize that for a lot of rural communities when we talk about funding that we recognize communities in the north and down south hunting and fishing is vital to their economic viability and as a state we provide a lot of incentives for such things as the movie industry and large corporations and while i support that and feel that theyre important to economic development why not provide some of these same types of incentives for our hunting and fishing communities as well so that they can derive some of that same benefit it also goes a long way to showing these communities just how important to the state they are and it would be a symbol to these communities that the state cares about them i support acquiring federal lands for providing hunting and fishing opportunities absolutely the criteria for selling and acquiring public lands it must be held on a case by case basis the criteria what is the public interest versus and balanced against environmental impact statements before any decision can be made about acquiring or selling public land you have to weigh the public interest you weigh those public interests of the tax payer with sportsmen with the political subdivisions of the state and also critically important you weigh them with the ability of the federal government entity that is going to be responsible for managing them you weigh it against their ability to manage it adequately thanks
8763485 first i want to say that i strongly disagree with the kind of deficit public land firesales that we have seen in recent years i think we have seen some very very irresponsible bills coming out of the congress that did not have any loyalty to the average sportsman ill tell you that i think the bar needs to be high anytime we dispose of public lands i think the way you look at it is that typically the lands that are disposed of need to be isolated lack access not have cultural or natural resource values that are important to the population they shouldnt be somebodys quail hunting spot and we have seen bills that would have sold off vast quantities of our public lands with the excuse that we were going to balance the budget and fix the deficit well if you want to fix the deficit my suggestion is you balance the budget weve done it before we can do it again if you want to sell off our public lands you could sell of the entire carson national forest not put a dent in the budget deficit and just make sure that i cant take my son fishing on the pecos or backpacking up to see that incredible herd of big horn sheep that hangs out around truchas peaks and chimayosos so i think we need to set a high bar and that resolve and i think when we do let those kinds of lands go that we should utilize those proceeds either through dollars or in trade to protect habitat winter habitat for elk and deer that live during the summer months on public land but have no access to secure winter habitat or to plug in holdings where development is threatening public resources where people hunt and fish and so we can balance those things and we can use the land and wildlife conservation fund as a way to make these things work for the average hunter the average fisherman so that when my son micah gets older when my son carter gets older those places will still be there for them that they will be able to go and enjoy the same javelina hunt down by hatch that i enjoy that theyll be able to go into the pecos wilderness and hunt for grouse these are things that are part of our traditions and i think we owe it to the next generation to make them secure
8763486 each concept theme or book of scripture is considered ultimately in terms of how it contributes to and advances the bibles meta narrative a salvation history that progresses toward and culminates in jesus christ
8763487 highlight the significance of covenant for biblical theology and explore the role of this concept within gods unfolding purpose
8763488 of the various divine human covenants in terms of gods eternal purpose
8763489 one cannot faithfully expound the bible without paying particular attention to this important theological trajectory
8763490 it is the basis for our present confidence in god as sustainer
8763491 allowing creation to be subsumed under covenant covenant must be understood in the context of creation
8763492 fasting is when you stop doing something and spend more time talking to jesus

8763508 but i do not think that when he spoke on 2 july 1959 he knew how bad the disaster had become and he believed the party was doing everything it could to manage the situation
8763509 although slaughter was not his purpose with the leap he was more than ready for myriad deaths to result and hinted to his top echelon that they should not be too shocked if they happened 438 439

8763518 mr rudd has the power now to withhold money from states that have not complied with this and and the challenge for him is will he do so
8763519 first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity
8763520 then i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all
8763521 i pulled out the wine and water to show that god absolves us of all
8763522 he bested me at every move and i could not continue
8763523 then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews and i told him that we were staying right here
8763524 be cruel anyone pepsico most videos woman just powerful celebrity can celeb worlds news roundup pictures winfrey
8763525 you think hes gonna set it off along the crowded street
8763526 unless theres something this old gun and i can do about it
8763527 hey i could put you on tv that shot was quite a story
8763528 you see that shotup length of wall the one without a door before the mortar hit it was a grocery store
8763529 but dont go thinking that to bomb a store is all that cruel
8763530 the little kids played soccer in the field out by the road
8763531 as bad as all this is though it could be a whole lot worse
8763532 today the fights on foreign land on streets that arent my own
8763533 so you can keep your trophies and your fleeting bit of fame
8763534 just tell the truth of what you see without the slant or spin and why not tell our folks back home about the good weve done you tell em what it means to folks here just to speak their mind without the fear that tyranny is just a step behind describe the desert miles they walk in their first chance to vote or ask a soldier if hes proud im sure youll get a quote
8763535 and maybe just remind the few if ill of us they speak
8763536 now this muddies the waters and keeps students from having a really good education
8763537 when they go to college they will be at a disadvantage because they will not have a good understanding of science
8763538 supporters of the new law clearly hope that teachers and administrators who wish to raise alternatives to evolution in science classes will feel protected if they do so the law expressly permits the use of supplemental classroom materials in addition to state approved textbooks
8763539 they may not be saying noahs flood or adam and eve anymore but it is the same creationist argument they are making
8763540 the lff has been lobbying the legislature for nine years laying this groundwork they have been waiting for a number of factors to come together now the legislature as a whole is conservative and we have a governor who favors creationism
8763541 it looks like louisiana is repeating history despite concerns from teachers scientists and legal scholars
8763542 they just arent even paying attention to what teachers are telling them we dont need this we dont want it
8763543 because some women have multiple identities we need to address their experience
8763544 all systems of power are linked and a multiple issue analysis is the only way to defeat oppression
8763545 people cant say n gger w tback or other racial oppressive words but they can still say r tard
8763546 when making tropic thunder dreamworks brought in african american consultants to make sure the movie wasnt offensive where were the disability consultants
8763547 how come racism was addressed but not the ableism why do people make a big deal out of the word n gg r but not r ta d
8763548 how much attention do the presidential candidates give people with disabilities compared to other minority groups
8763549 people get upset at the n word so why not fill in the blank
8763550 if you were saying this to a black man instead of a woman
8763551 womens black peoples iq is just the same as mens white peoples
8763552 single most powerful explanatory device adopted by academic historians to account for the distinctive features of american society culture and identity
8763553 the compelling idea that theres serious evil in the world and hardship and pain and we should be humble and modest in our belief we can eliminate those things
8763554 apparently the good inspector has solved the jack the ripper murders watson unfortunately you are the main suspect
8763555 we have witnesses that you were in whitechapel this evening threatening to gut a woman
8763556 but not to kill them only to scare them off i assure you if id meant to hit that man id have done so
8763557 there are four witnesses swearing out statements against doctor watson at this very second all in agreement that he fired the gun at them
8763558 matters of observation are my business inspector i would submit that you would do well to make them yours as well
8763559 for example if you possessed one single shred of observational skill you would notice the state of watsons clothing
8763560 his face is both bloodied and bruised yet i see only one small cut on the knuckles of his right hand
8763561 further the tops of his shoes have been scraped past the dye as only a man laying on his stomach could do how is any of this possible if the men you are taking a sworn statement from are telling you the truth
8763562 be that as it may holmes i am still taking him in
8763563 i can clearly see some on the hand of ms adler all in perfect keeping with what you have just been told by two upstanding citizens in my presence
8763564 i assure you inspector i will follow you to scotland yard and make my opinions heard very loudly
8763565 the both of you are completely incompetent unqualified and insanely foolish to have attempted this
8763566 just because we cant sit here hiding in our cozy little apartment while women are being butchered at random doesnt mean you have the right to chastise us holmes
8763567 a bumbling doctor and an opera singer trying to catch a killer
8763568 it would be amusing if it werent so completely ludicrous
8763569 day after day people bring you little dilemmas like the one that involved me with you
8763570 and people fall back in awe as if you had done something impressive
8763571 who knows holmes maybe if you actually felt blood moving through your heart beating in the thrill of the moment you wouldnt need a syringe full of cocaine in your arm
8763572 it would seem the madness of the ripper is beginning to possess us all
8763573 we have seen a small improvement in consumer confidence in august but this should not be seen as a turnaround in core sentiment
8763574 this improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence such as cheaper petrol offers summer holidays happening or just a general feeling of things cant get any worse can they
8763575 when we looked at the index score before and after the olympic weekend the score rose three points between the first and second weekend
8763576 this combined with summer holiday euphoria may have helped lift consumers perceptions of their personal situation and the general economy
8763577 theres been positive feedback but theres also been some adjustments that need to be made and we really need to sit down and talk about that and put our best foot forward
8763578 what are the adjustments that have to happen not to assume we got it all 100 per cent completely right
8763579 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8763580 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8763581 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8763582 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8763583 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation
8763584 how did we overcome such obsticals and set backs they told me i was average but i just couldnt accept that let that be the words carved in my headstone p s you hatin motherf kers were dead wrong
8763585 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8763586 protection of fundamental characteristics of the republic cannot be considered an intervention in domestic politics
8763587 imaginary scenarios aim to bring down the reputation of the turkish armed forces
8763588 all attacks on our ability to perform our duties are bound to disappear in the face of our resolve
8763589 laws that are amended as if there is no terrorism threat against our country prevent the security forces from fighting terrorism in a rapid and effective manner
8763590 if terrorists are threatening human rights we need to reconsider the balance between rights and freedoms and take counter measures
8763591 but theres also speculation about what akp will do will it become more moderate or try again to impose islamism
8763592 the military are giving them the message that they are still here and prepared to defend secularism
8763593 there is real frustration within the military at what they see as an assault by the akp on ataturks secular legacy and also what they consider to be the political motivations of the ergenekon investigation they think the aim isnt to unearth the deep state but to undermine the military as an institution
8763594 i was always noticeable and i always knew i was different
8763595 i did get some bullying at school because i was different because i was brown but a lot of other kids were bullied as well if you were a bit too tall a bit too small
8763596 one of the key political moments was thatchers right to buy council house policy i remember the excitement that went round that neighbourhood seeing people contemplating ownership after a lifetime of renting
8763597 my children werent babies any longer and the practice had become established
8763598 i almost felt at last im ready for public service
8763599 it was almost looking in the biscuit barrel not liking the look of the biscuits and slamming the lid shut
8763600 i heard one of his speeches when he said he recognised there was a whole generation of people who worked hard who wanted nice things themselves but who also believed in social justice i thought thats me yes we are business people we do want to make money we do want to do well but we really care about looking after each other
8763601 i dont think im fearful of anything apart from possibly rats
8763602 im a careful person and there will be no complacency in my campaign im treating maidstone and the weald as if its a marginal and i will work as hard as i possibly can
8763603 im not bored or frustrated with it because i havent done it people have asked me to but i havent because in this first period i really wanted to focus on the constituency if im asked to comment in the future i will but i wont be the person always putting my hand up there are a lot of people who are diverse and of colour in the conservative party who may well have a different view from me
8763604 i do not believe for one minute that boris is racist
8763605 i believed hed do it and obviously my selection as the ppc for maidstone and the weald is evidence in many respects that that has happened
8763606 if were removing party politics completely just the man and what he has to offer and what hes doing at the moment for america i think he would make a very very good president
8763607 at the moment ive just got to be a hard working prospective parliamentary candidate getting elected and looking after the people of maidstone and the weald thats the job and thats what im determined to do
8763608 this is a monumental moment in our nations history and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8763609 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8763610 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8763611 lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8763612 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8763613 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8763614 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8763615 my case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8763616 long honourable and occasionally blood stained record on the championing of diversity
8763617 in short i think it is long past time we shut up stop making public statements about a private dispute and get on with the job we are paid to do
8763618 i do not think it was appropriate for this matter to be conducted in such a public way
8763619 those movements carefully position the flys centre of mass relative to the jumping legs so that leg extension propels them away from the looming threat
8763620 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8763621 the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small changes in its posture to reach the correct pre flight stance
8763622 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8763623 well i say to them tonight theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
8763624 the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats
8763625 but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states we coach little league school baseball in the blue states and yes weve got some gay friends in the red states
8763626 do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope
8763627 the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs
8763628 the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too
8763629 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8763630 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8763631 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation
8763632 manifest our suffering in the face of the ratification of the criminal abortion law in our city
8763633 makes legal what can never be moral as is the murder of innocent and defenseless babies in the womb of their mother and for which the government offers its health facilities for these abominable crimes institutions that in other times sought to defend the principle of life
8763634 we contemplate with sadness the egotism and pettiness that defends death before life and for that reason we lift our requests through prayer and the ringing of the bells so that in a sign of suffering mourning and penance for the indiscriminate slaughter of infants we may ask the forgiveness of god for those who have promoted voted for and ratified this murderous law
8763635 its not opinion and its not religion taking a life is not your decision
8763636 i got out of bed and walked by myself today
8763637 it was hard but im making great progress and taking things one day at a time

8763639 i feel blessed truly blessed because ill be able to walk again and lead a normal life
8763640 the guys call me a lot that shows what footballs all about relationships that youll have for the rest of your life were a family and were going to stick by each other no matter what
8763641 im going to be okay i want them to focus on football this is an important season coach gary kubiak has them believing in each other theyve got a big game coming up against pittsburgh
8763642 i cant wait to get back to houston to see my guys i miss them so much ill be back sometime next week i cant wait
8763643 i came here to see a good leader i do not
8763644 i cant believe that the future president of the united states and i smoked a cigarette together in a gay bar
8763645 upholds natural family planning not just as a method but as a way of self awareness in promoting the culture of life while discouraging the use of artificial methods of contraception
8763646 deprive s many women of their main source of affordable family planning supplies
8763647 ensure right of citizens to a full range of family planning services and information
8763648 would establish constitutional protections for reproductive rights throughout the country it could also be used to defend similar rights in neighboring countries as well as in catholic countries throughout the world
8763649 i think there is a balance but at every political convention there are celebrities that come
8763650 an opportunity for 80 000 people who might otherwise not have been able to participate to get involved

8763655 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8763656 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8763657 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8763658 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8763659 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8763660 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8763661 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8763662 one of the really lovely things to do of an evening is put some gentle music on the cd player and put a thing like this under the microscope changing your focus exploring finding an ant or maybe another one close to it and what the relationships were maybe a petal or something from a cone if you really want solace if you really want deep pleasure and joy you find it in the natural world
8763663 the claims that we have allowed to be fostered have contributed to this couples huge distress
8763664 i was terrified i cant help feeling desperately sorry for alec although i dont approve i wouldnt have the guts to say look theres no point this isnt going to work he has to believe this will give him some extraordinary effect maybe it will maybe it wont
8763665 i hope i never see anything like that ever again

8763669 mothers are the primary carers for small children in afghanistan
8763670 they are critical in securing better healthcare for children and particular attention should be paid to maternal autonomy at the household level for promotion of the health status of children in afghanistan
8763671 regarding child marriages not only the married child but also the children of child mothers are subject to a number of disadvantages the poor economic and educational status of these women and their overall immaturity caused by a lack of learning opportunities may have resulted in difficulties in preventing illness in their children
8763672 culturally appropriate programs that provide families and communities with education and reproductive health services can help stop child marriage
8763673 governments should play a role in this endeavour as well as strengthen efforts to meets the basic material needs of citizens
8763674 im gonna do this the rest of the day in fact
8763675 yonge and dundas is one of the busiest intersections in the city of toronto

8763713 la cosa peggiore e che ho visto tutta la nostra vita assieme
8763714 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8763715 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8763716 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8763721 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8763722 i have never met a japanese man who did not want me to be his mommy
8763723 this suggests that the decrease in fertility is due almost entirely to an increase in women of reproductive age not getting married and not having children
8763724 we need to organize our society so that women and families will be able to raise children while working
8763725 i think we still lack adequate efforts on that front
8763726 the burden falls almost exclusively on women and those single women who see that happening choose not to marry for now anyway
8763727 for women this has caused enormous change socially and mentally
8763728 guys will allow a woman to express herself but they do not want their position threatened
8763729 i am willing to take care of and give comfort to a man whom i care about but that does not mean i want to be his mother
8763730 i dont know why one would want a child so much
8763731 in japanese culture the point is not to have children but to have ones own children
8763732 there is still a foundation in us japanese women that thinks hunting for a guy is not ladylike
8763733 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8763734 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8763735 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8763736 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8763737 we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8763738 we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president when the average american family saw its income go up 7 500 instead of down 2 000 like it has under george bush
8763739 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8763740 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8763741 the fact that we can bring 60 000 means that we have a real organizing opportunity
8763742 am i concerned no i feel great about this opportunity
8763743 i would only be concerned about the mccain campaign sitting in an empty stadium
8763744 senator obama has a job to do out there tonight
8763745 which is to go out there and let the american people know where he comes from where he wants to take this country and lend some specificity to what exactly his plans are when it comes to tax cuts and health care and responsibly ending the war in iraq hes going to talk about all of those things in pretty clear terms
8763746 barack obama is the best speechmaker in politics today so if theres anyone who can deliver with this much expectation its him
8763747 it looks like they are getting ready for the emperor to arrive dont you think
8763748 and it feeds into the notion of its a big production a lot of entertainment a lot of hoopla and i think with the roman columns and the facade it is perfect because the facade is for production purposes but there is not much behind it and thats a perfect metaphor for barack obamas readiness to be president of the united states
8763749 saya juga berterima kasih kepada setiap orang yang selama ini mendukung

8763751 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8763752 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8763753 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8763754 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8763755 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8763756 the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
8763757 this is the same system we have in place today
8763758 the only difference is that we will now provide a limit by which a customer may be contacted
8763759 an extremely large amount of data much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis
8763760 as part of our pre existing policy we will continue to contact the top users of our high speed internet service and ask them to curb their usage
8763761 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8763762 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8763763 once he does that forms a new government then he has put a final nail on this dialogue so what in fact you are doing is you are making people suffer and therefore declaring a war on the people
8763764 thats what we are expecting and we are planning to give passage a safe area for them to come out of that
8763765 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8763766 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8763767 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8763768 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8763769 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8763770 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8763771 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8763772 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8763773 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8763774 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8763775 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8763776 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8763777 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8763778 i cant believe were finally able to leave for medical treatment
8763779 the israeli threats of intercepting the boats dont scare me
8763780 we will smash the blockade so my son can get a prosthesis
8763781 why is it that the only people in the mediterranean without access to their own waters are the palestinians
8763782 your coming to gaza rewards the endurance of the palestinian population in the face of the occupation
8763783 by coming to gaza we realised the extent of the suffering of its population
8763784 treatment for alienated children what works what doesnt and why
8763785 some of them were decapitated some did not have a hand each body was photographed
8763786 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8763787 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8763788 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8763789 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8763790 no one works for someone we all just work together
8763791 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8763792 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8763793 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8763794 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8763795 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8763796 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8763797 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8763798 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8763799 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8763800 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8763801 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8763802 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8763803 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8763804 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8763805 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8763806 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8763807 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8763808 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8763809 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8763810 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8763811 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8763812 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8763813 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8763814 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8763815 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8763816 we are absolutely focused on growing our leadership position in gateways and at the same time it was important to genband to find the right application centric company who would ensure the continued success of our m6 customers
8763817 our relationship with broadsoft provides partnering opportunities for us and a solid transition for our application customer base so this is a win win
8763818 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8763819 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8763820 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8763821 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8763822 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8763823 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8763824 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8763825 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8763826 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8763827 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8763828 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8763829 john mccain already looks presidential because every president in our history has looked like john mccain hes the default setting for american presidents
8763830 this is a full scale major operation to take care wash and feed the animals
8763831 if the owner doesnt turn up shelter officials are planning to contact people who applied to adopt prince chunk

8763834 el aborto era letra muerta y lo que se propiciaba era la clandestinidad
8763835 que las mujeres de escasos recursos han accedido a la ley que quede claro que no queremos abortos sino embarazos no deseados
8763836 la cara de felicidad no nos la quita ni la constituci n
8763837 yo me quedo con la frase de g ngora pimentel que esta ma ana dijo las ni as tiene derecho a no ser madres

8763841 la lengua es el parto del pensamiento y el cultivo de ese parto es lo que hace un escritor
8763842 if we come to the irrevocable conclusion that we should have an election its not because we have polls that are any different than anybody else
8763843 its because that while weve had 2 1 2 years of government all the signs indicate that this parliament is at the end of its usefulness
8763844 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8763845 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8763846 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8763847 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8763848 pens alice dietro quella barriera di legno che avevo posto tra me e il mondo esterno
8763849 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche quando il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scarti e bonacce prolungate ma passa perfino per me bella

8763856 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8763857 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8763858 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8763859 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8763860 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8763861 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8763862 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8763863 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8763864 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8763865 examinations will test their knowledge on a variety of subjects and not necessarily related to the discipline they teach
8763866 which implies that the government is not serious about increasing their salaries
8763867 some of the teachers who will be tested have been in the profession for over 30 years they taught the minister of education himself why after 30 years of teaching are they being tested now
8763868 this is an insult to teachers why dont they do this for all professions why just teachers
8763869 basic education will be elevated by applying national educational standards and school focussed comprehensive reform
8763870 the minister insists on the exam and there will be no other alternative this is for the welfare of students and teachers
8763871 this is not just about minimum wage it is about a policy which will eventually end up humiliating teachers and ending their career forever
8763872 so that correct answers can be altered and the numbers passing the exam controlled on what basis are we going to be tested
8763873 egypt is in trouble because its education is in trouble we call for the resignation of the syndicates leaders and the creation of a popular syndicate which will defend teachers rights rather than adopting government causes
8763874 the cadre is to establish the principle of reward and punishment to raise salaries of teachers benefiting about one million teachers against financial costs of about le4 billion
8763875 it isnt just teachers who prop up the education system there are huge numbers of administrative staff who play a vital role
8763876 we were told that our wages would be increased under the civil service law issued in 2007
8763877 they initially promised us a 50 per cent increase over three years
8763878 this promise was subsequently retracted because the finance minister claimed we receive more than our due in the form of examinations bonuses
8763879 it is incorrect to call this payment a bonus administrative employees who are absent from work due to sickness do not receive it it is therefore more accurate to describe it as a payment given in return for duties performed
8763880 nobody will give us anything unless we voice our legitimate demands for our rights after 36 years in this profession i earn le600 per month some administrative employees earn only le150 per month and take bribes just to survive
8763881 the new system has been created to increase the availability and to promote the quality of basic education and school teachers quality
8763882 that is not the same thing as having health insurance
8763883 people without insurance are less likely to seek care and when they do the cost to the health system is greater she said
8763884 so the uninsured pay more and hence the government when reimbursing hospitals cannot meet the costs that were incurred
8763885 if they had universal health care they wouldnt have to use the ambulance because they could just drive themselves to the doctor
8763886 illness and medical bills caused half of the 1 458 000 personal bankruptcies in 2001 according to a study published by the journal health affairs in many cases illness forced breadwinners to take time off from work losing income and job based health insurance precisely when families needed it most families in bankruptcy suffered many privations 30 percent had a utility cut off and 61 percent went without needed medical care
8763887 illness and medical bills caused half of the 1 458 000 personal bankruptcies in 2001
8763888 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8763889 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8763890 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8763891 john goodman president of the national center for policy analysis a right leaning dallas based think tank who helped craft sen john mccains health care policy
8763892 in medicine above all the mind must be left free
8763893 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8763894 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8763895 a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouths of labor the bread it has earned
8763896 w e conclude that section 13 202 2 e evinces a clear legislative intent that the 2003 amendment apply to all cases filed on or after its effective date including those in which the allegations of abuse relate to events that preceded the amendment
8763897 the development environment for the n810 is essentially the same as that described for the n800 see my other articles on the 770 and n800
8763898 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8763899 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8763900 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8763901 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8763902 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8763903 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8763904 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8763905 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8763906 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8763907 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8763908 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8763909 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8763910 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8763911 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8763912 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8763913 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8763914 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8763915 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8763916 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8763917 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8763918 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8763919 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8763920 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8763921 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8763922 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8763923 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8763924 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

8763944 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8763945 weapons of mass destruction have you found them in iraq yet or are you still looking for them
8763946 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association that we heard from ambassador churkin
8763947 in breach of fundamental norms and principles of international law and sovereignty
8763948 russia is moving forward altering the post soviet 1991 borders with unpredictable results
8763949 there is no place in todays world for attempts to redraw boundaries of our international order unless confronted by the international community russian policies will eventually force another conflict elsewhere
8763950 a unilateral attempt to redraw the borders of a neighbouring country through the use of force
8763951 if we can manage our national security issues the way this case was handled were going to diminish the terrorism threat to north america substantially
8763952 no doubt mr reumayr was a very very evil man and the plans he had were very evil and sinister
8763953 it saved both countries an unknown amount of stress and economic chaos there was a lot of hard work by everyone involved to bring this to a successful conclusion
8763954 ive told jeff that everyone should take advantage of their natural strength
8763955 with the start of school its a great time to do a commercial showing gordon smith finally coming around on global warming or the iraq war
8763956 then you show jeff on the screen looking really geeky and say something like but jeff merkley is a guy thats done his homework
8763957 it has occurred to me that if i am going to spend the rest of my life fighting bill sizemore i might as well do it from a position of power
8763958 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8763959 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8763960 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8763961 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8763962 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8763963 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8763964 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8763965 it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8763966 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8763967 trying to draw up a strong text signifying our unwillingness to accept
8763968 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well

8763975 anakin could you bring my slippers and todays paper please
8763976 at times you get so over stimulated and agitated by these voice that you often flip out
8763977 if you are asked about this matter your message should be it is now under investigation
8763978 you have to remember that the sources are often other inmates and theyre not the most reliable sources in the world
8763979 you need to have fairly cogent evidence before you lock down an institution otherwise youd be locking it down consistently the issue here though is what was the information how cogent was it and what steps did the staff take
8763980 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
8763981 most of them would not intentionally help him or cover up his whereabouts
8763982 at the same time theyre not going out of their way to find him and turn him in or see that justice is done
8763983 a little rough around the edges but hes basically a pretty good guy
8763984 two things if youre programs are good and you are reasonably price thats pretty hard to beat
8763985 i noticed it was a little cheaper this morning when i was driving to work but a lot of people have been coming in where i work saying go get gas
8763986 thank you very much for showing up for your duty i appreciate that you take your responsibilities seriously
8763987 okay so ive never been thanked for showing up for duty
8763988 they have a real problem with teachers here doing duty a lot of people never show up all year its a problem
8763989 i exist therefore i experience the joy of my existence
8763990 we want our members to be happy with their purchases for home improvement purchases that ultimately comes down to how good things look once they are installed in your home thats why were extremely selective about the contractors we work with and refer to our members
8763991 so even though youre getting a discounted rate on their services youre still working with highly skilled professionals many of whom are also directbuy members and because theyre members they have a vested interest in providing excellent service not just to obtain referrals for more work in the future but also to remain in good standing as a member
8763992 we are working with the swimming clubs to source alternate venues for them to get access to lanes
8763993 ive been particularly pleased with the response from some of the other private pool operators who have been willing to work with the sport and recreation area and the swimming clubs to get access to greater lanes
8763994 they are heated and we certainly hope that would be able to address some of the concerns most particularly in november
8763995 i recognise that in september it would still be a little bit cold outside but to address the concerns around november and towards really the second half of october
8763996 and he was like i am im like yup minneapolis underground film festival hes like ive never heard of that and im like well its been around for a while hes like for how long and im like
8763997 i think in the first month that the web site was up and that was back in march i got 5 000 hits
8763998 it is a film that you would not see through regular channels
8763999 and i wanted to have a heroine that is no victim at all never has been but she is violent and there is no explanation
8764000 i was just imagining what you would look like when you are dead
8764001 for a film maker like me who does things that are well gosh they are hard to take sometimes this is a really great venue to see films like that and see the artistry that goes with the dark side
8764002 argentina flaunts the dubious merit of being the first country in history to judge its victorious soldiers
8764003 they call the operations of the armed forces illegal repression
8764004 ive never seen or done anything to mr vargas aignasse in my entire life
8764005 i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8764006 she has been responsible with her work shes been doing a great job however drinking and using isnt the only form of addiction and the relationship that lindsay has with samantha is toxic
8764007 i think sooner or later youre going to see lindsay right back up on top where she belongs and shes going to turn around and say dad you were right all along
8764008 she dated guys her whole life she has a relationship with sam and its a friendship because shes been hurt by so many guys in the past maybe she kind of walked away and found solace and companionship in a girl
8764009 i dont believe its anything more than a friendship they have
8764010 but thats between lindsay and god and samantha and god
8764011 if dina was on the right page and doing the right thing as a mother and didnt play two sides of the coin like she does then things would be much better for lindsay
8764012 she tells me one thing about sams relationship with lindsay and how opposed she is to it and even told me yesterday that sams writing a book and she tells me lindsay shouldnt be around samantha but in the meantime shes sitting having dinner with the ronsons
8764013 the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8764014 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is
8764015 i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else when does your book come out mr lohan
8764016 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8764017 l a is a really young city and its great for now but eventually im going to want to settle down a little bit
8764018 at this point the future is so cloudy in terms of the development of the market when its going to pick up again
8764019 then i see a very good opportunity that basically i would hope that everything could be break even to profitable
8764020 we would hope to have the corporation profitable again by then
8764021 we are selling every hhr and cobalt we can make with either minimal or zero incentives whereas three years ago even the hhr you had to put 3 000 bucks on it to move it so i think in practice the price of small cars has gone up three or four thousand dollars
8764022 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8764023 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8764024 because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8764025 we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8764026 we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president when the average american family saw its income go up 7 500 instead of down 2 000 like it has under george bush
8764027 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8764028 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8764029 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8764030 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8764031 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8764032 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8764033 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8764034 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8764035 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8764036 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8764037 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8764038 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8764039 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8764040 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8764041 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8764042 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8764043 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8764044 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8764045 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8764046 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8764047 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8764048 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8764049 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8764050 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8764051 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8764052 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8764053 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8764054 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8764055 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8764056 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8764057 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us

8764060 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
8764061 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com
8764062 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8764063 all bassinets produced and sold by sfca are produced in this manner with fabric permanently attached over the lower bar and meet or exceed astm standards and cpsc guidelines
8764064 its rather obvious when you look at this bassinet that its defective and dangerous
8764065 the problem is that people dont think in those terms when you go to wal mart and find something covered with walt disneys winnie the pooh you dont think like that
8764066 has given everything he could to his country except his life
8764067 the significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them

8764071 so hes more interested in montana issues and has some personal experience here
8764072 therere a couple things worth remembering historically montana has not been a very red state to use the modern terminology
8764073 weve elected only two republicans to the u s senate
8764074 democrats have been most of the last century republicans have only been very competitive for the past 25 years
8764075 barack writes his speeches himself this ones had 4 000 drafts and he was toiling on it last night
8764076 hes been there six times and weve got a good chance in montana
8764077 barack told us from the first we were going to compete in every state we believe weve got 168 safe electoral votes and 32 leaning our way oregon washington minnesota and new hampshire its a lot harder for john mccain to make the numbers work if we win colorado it gets very hard for him
8764078 i got a call from barack asking if he could talk to me
8764079 around the campaign we have this saying no drama in obama we have no time for intrigue
8764080 obama wants a flat campaign meaning everyone gets a voice we have unleashed independent initiative on a vast scale this is a campaign of smart young people one invented the idea of notifying anyone who signed up to find out who the vice presidential nominee would be via cell phone we got two million new contacts
8764081 if people worry about what obama stands for this 77 page book will have it all
8764082 hillary clinton has been amazing she called us she was right about how to play things this week it was there idea that hillary come to the floor to move the nomination by acclamation and shes going to be on the road all the time we could not ask for more
8764083 joe biden came to chicago and said treat me like staff
8764084 our people went crazy contacting our supporters it was the single best fund raising day weve ever had
8764085 tear the hide off us and i think theyll be good at it this will be a very close election ten percent have not made up their minds
8764086 we will have diverted all that money to address the least likely threat while the real threats come into this country in the hold of a ship or the belly of a plane or are smuggled into a city in the middle of the night in a vial in a backpack
8764087 they did not and because of that i had to go through this
8764088 tom higgins was a rapist he is a serial rapist what he did to us was garner our trust to exploit that trust to re enact that rape without consent
8764089 we are committed to reaching a resolution to settle this case and are prepared to continue discussions with all parties to make sure that occurs
8764090 when an accusation of employee misconduct comes to our attention we take it very seriously we conduct an immediate and thorough investigation
8764091 and theyre trying to take another i think i have suffered long enough
8764092 i believe they uofm realized they were in way over their heads
8764093 the world bank has warned that world poverty is much greater than previously thought
8764094 going to church doesnt make you a christian any gt more than going to a garage makes you a mechanic
8764095 can russia guarantee that such actions wouldnt be made in other countries
8764096 at this time i was im beijing as you know and i had a chance
8764097 so what we should allow to kill us but in exchange of it to save place in g8 but who will be presented at g8 if all of us will be killed we talked with you about possible threat from russia you and me we sit now and peacefully talking in the city of sochi at several hundred kilometers from here american army ships have arrived with missles on board the distance of firing is exactly several hundred kilometers its not our ships came to your shores but your ships came to our shores so what choice do we have we dont need any complications we dont want to argue with anybody to fight with anybody we want partnership and respecting us and our interests
8764098 the keyword system referred to is one of a number of security checks that are used by lloyds tsb primarily for certain small business customers
8764099 but in response to customer demand for a wider range of services over the phone we introduced a new security number system for small business customers
8764100 in this case it was a business banking customer using a system where more than one person from a business can check their balance
8764101 in these cases an advisor can read the full password
8764102 it is disgraceful that border patrol agents are put in harms way and our government doesnt do everything reasonably within its power to protect us from marauding mexican soldiers and others
8764103 without a forceful response to these illegal incursions an agent will eventually be seriously wounded or killed it is only a matter of time
8764104 the incursions will not stop until the mexican military units and their commanders are held accountable for their actions
8764105 it is a documented fact that the mexican military is corrupt and is involved in protecting drug cartels smugglers and other criminals

8764107 we take very seriously our role in working with our international neighbors to address and resolve these situations
8764108 the fact that the mexican military is operating in such close proximity to the border without any identifiable purpose calls into question its activities and raises concerns about the vulnerability of our southern land border
8764109 when considering the frequency of incursions and the threat these encounters pose to our border patrol agents it is critical that we take the necessary steps to ensure that mexican military and law enforcement personnel do not cross into the u s without our knowledge or consent
8764110 will result in a clearer delineation of the international border
8764111 a reasonable person would conclude that the soldiers knew exactly at whom they were pointing their rifles
8764112 had the agent panicked and fired a shot or attempted to flee in his vehicle there is little doubt the mexican soldiers would have opened fire
8764113 during past incursions the mexican government has denied it had soldiers in the area they have blamed impostors even when military humvees were involved

8764130 we were informed by local officials and evacuees from barangay balanakin that the milf faction that took emben and his companion allowed the milf ceasefire monitors to leave first before taking them captives
8764131 if the fighting continues for every civilian killed we will execute 10 milf rebels
8764132 we are for arming civilians in areas targeted by milf and for them to defend their families and property
8764133 every effort is being made to clarify all issues on the proposed memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain through oral arguments before the supreme court and in continuing dialogs between the government and local communities in mindanao
8764134 the milf has no choice but to adhere to the teaching of prophet muhammad that is when one is fasting he must refrain from uttering false statements avoid loud voices which will disturb others and if any one fights you tell him that you are fasting instead of fighting back
8764135 theres no let up i hope it would be over before ramadan starts
8764136 he kato has to answer for the crimes he committed
8764137 the 2004 democratic nominee for president who was bluntly informed by grassroots activists that they did not want him to run again in 2008 might not have gained a prime time speaking spot at the convention except for the fact of the massachusetts senators early and enthusiastic support of obama
8764138 it expenditure will be comparatively resilient if there is a downturn this time around
8764139 there was a significant backlash against it from the dotcom bubble and y2k
8764140 there are potentially millions of files containing sensitive or confidential data that may be accessible to a large number of airport employees and contractors
8764141 i felt it was in everyone best interest to halt the flow of loans for now we should have a better idea in the next 2 weeks
8764142 we cant go on as we are we have either got to get behind him or get rid of him we cant do both
8764143 our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8764144 this case highlights a worrying trend where uk citizens are at the mercy of the ever increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country
8764145 surely this is not a work of art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people
8764146 wounds the religious sentiments of so many people who see in the cross the symbol of gods love
8764147 art must always be free and the artist should not have any restrictions on freedom of expression
8764148 sure a man is nothing when confronted by the power of the almighty
8764149 with net debt now in excess of 1 8bn nervousness over gearing is unlikely to go away any time soon
8764150 our expectations for the year as a whole remain unchanged with progress weighted towards the second half as the benefit of all these fundamental actions begin to flow through
8764151 sure a man is nothing when confronted by the power of the almighty
8764152 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8764153 lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8764154 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8764155 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8764156 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8764157 it is calm and safe i had no fear about bringing my wife and children
8764158 well i say to them tonight theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
8764159 the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats
8764160 but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states we coach little league school baseball in the blue states and yes weve got some gay friends in the red states
8764161 do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope
8764162 the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs
8764163 the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too
8764164 i want to see year on year improvements like teachers across the country i have high expectations for all children there are no quick fixes but more can be done especially for children who are really struggling with basic literacy and numeracy and for those children who with a bit of help could reach the next level up
8764165 it is vital that children get the basics early in primary school but the results for seven year olds are flatlining
8764166 there must be a much greater focus on early identification of these problems and more one to one support for children with basic literacy and numeracy problems
8764167 the rise in performance across the key stages once again highlights that wales is making positive progress under our revised assessment arrangements
8764168 our focus is very much on consolidating progress made to date and building on it for the future the new skills based curriculum implementation of the foundation phase and developments at 14 to 19 will all help to ensure that our achievements are sustained and developed
8764169 get your calculators out i know this is going to beep your horn
8764170 we are aiming to break into the mainstream of british society
8764171 we will be establishing city churches in manchester leeds and edinburgh
8764172 i have changed the landscape of the christian church in the uk
8764173 this has become a social force in the new europe but one that is usually marginalised and misunderstood
8764174 the growth of churches like kicc is because of the continuing influx of west africans it becomes a place where they can feel at home and every facet of human life is catered for and we should look at it as a very positive force for society
8764175 this is a place where people can feel a sense of connectedness and they use the pastors as mentors who they can look to for direction
8764176 we have career counselling legal guidance and marriage help we are making ourselves relevant to the community
8764177 pastor matthew ashimilowo is my motivator and an inspiration because of what god has done in his life
8764178 i have changed from knowing gang lifestyles now that i know god is preparing me to be a role model in the future
8764179 we havent closed the gap in fact the gap has widened but the health of those who are most disadvantaged in life expectancy and infant mortality is at the same level as the rest of the population was eight years ago
8764180 the first thing is it is measuring and monitoring the problem we have really got as good a measure as any other country of the magnitude of the problem the fact that the government has had the courage to publish the bad news is important secondly we are taking it seriously the fact that we havent narrowed the gap means we have more work to do
8764181 toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8764182 in rich countries low socioeconomic position means poor education lack of amenities unemployment and job insecurity poor working conditions and unsafe neighbourhoods with their consequent impact on family life these all apply to the socially disadvantaged in low income countries in addition to the considerable burden of material deprivation and vulnerability to natural disasters
8764183 this is a monumental moment in our nations history and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8764184 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8764185 we have been investing this year particularly behind the big four category leaders weve got smirnoff baileys bells and gordons
8764186 weve been working with the retailers to produce a shelf layout and a combination of products that works
8764187 our concern is that perceived defensiveness could be tested during the year to june 2009 given a 55 operating profit exposure to the problem housing market economies of the us uk spain and ireland together with increasing signs of slowing growth in certain emerging markets
8764188 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items
8764189 retail conditions have been extremely tough this summer and the wet august has been a further blow sadly no let up is expected as we head into early autumn the business outlook is particularly weak and retailers are having to scale back their employment and investment plans in an attempt to ride out the storm
8764190 augusts cbi distributive trades survey makes for pretty grim reading not least because the reported sales balance fell to yet a new record low and the surveys been going since the early 1980s suggesting that conditions on the high street are even worse than in the previous recession even a near term cut in interest rates wont bail out the economy over the next few months indeed we now expect both consumer spending and overall gdp to fall next year
8764191 this improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence such as cheaper petrol offers summer holidays happening or just a general feeling of things cant get any worse can they in particular winning gold medals in the olympics seems to have had a lifting effect when we looked at the index score before and after the olympics weekend the score rose 3 points between the first and second weekend this combined with summer holiday euphoria may have helped lift consumers perceptions of their personal situation and the general economy
8764192 protection of fundamental characteristics of the republic cannot be considered an intervention in domestic politics
8764193 imaginary scenarios aim to bring down the reputation of the turkish armed forces
8764194 all attacks on our ability to perform our duties are bound to disappear in the face of our resolve
8764195 laws that are amended as if there is no terrorism threat against our country prevent the security forces from fighting terrorism in a rapid and effective manner
8764196 if terrorists are threatening human rights we need to reconsider the balance between rights and freedoms and take counter measures
8764197 but theres also speculation about what akp will do will it become more moderate or try again to impose islamism
8764198 the military are giving them the message that they are still here and prepared to defend secularism
8764199 there is real frustration within the military at what they see as an assault by the akp on ataturks secular legacy and also what they consider to be the political motivations of the ergenekon investigation they think the aim isnt to unearth the deep state but to undermine the military as an institution
8764200 those movements carefully position the flys centre of mass relative to the jumping legs so that leg extension propels them away from the looming threat
8764201 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8764202 the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small changes in its posture to reach the correct pre flight stance
8764203 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8764204 he liked to live life big with holidays and cars
8764205 fire crews have been damping down hotspots to bring the temperature low enough for structural work to begin it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined this is not something which can be done quickly once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8764206 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers she is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well
8764207 this looks like further evidence of the chaos at the heart of government
8764208 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters
8764209 the truth is that the tories change in language has touched a nerve reflecting a big gap in our own political narrative yet beneath camerons rhetoric lies the basic philosophy that failed britain in the past the tories demand responsibility without offering support they appeal for fraternity without any real belief in equality they have finally noticed society but remain implacably hostile to the state
8764210 the political language deployed by the opposition should also prompt us in the labour party to refresh our core story after 11 years in government
8764211 the danger is that we spend too much time emphasising what works and not enough making the case for what matters this is a trap all governing parties face even ken livingstone the archetypal insurgent became weighed down by incumbency in seeking a third term in office
8764212 the next agenda must be forged through starting with the pressures and the struggles that people face in their own lives at its most basic this means a clearer story about two things the limits of the market and the new frontiers of the welfare state old labour was hostile to the market new labour has arguably been too deferential to it
8764213 the scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country the rollcall of deaths and injuries is horrific some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and regrettably but doubtlessly the rollcall of death and serious injury will continue to rise
8764214 grant was expelled from beaconsfield secondary school in the fourth year probably age about 15 for persistent disruptive behaviour
8764215 he never went back to school after that he worked on building sites as a labourer but became involved in drug dealing which was what his first prison term was for as well as more thieving
8764216 met the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity the firearms have since been used in all of our big cities especially london
8764217 russia does not feel isolated and is not afraid to be isolated
8764218 thats a demonstration of complete confusion the product of a sick mind
8764219 will be to the detriment of the eu as much if not more than to russia i certainly hope reason and common sense will prevail
8764220 the essential aim of the summit following the latest russian declarations is to show europes unity and capacity to act balancing the need for dialogue and the need for firmness towards russia
8764221 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict to make the situation more tense and create a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8764222 my case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8764223 long honourable and occasionally blood stained record on the championing of diversity
8764224 in short i think it is long past time we shut up stop making public statements about a private dispute and get on with the job we are paid to do
8764225 i do not think it was appropriate for this matter to be conducted in such a public way
8764226 were both teachers and we have three young children so moneys always tight
8764227 i dont buy as much organic food as i used to simple as that
8764228 i tend to look at the lower cost cheaper brands rather than the brands i went for before
8764229 and also where i used to buy free range and organic foods i tend to steer away from them now
8764230 we saw the chicken programme some weeks ago on the television and we saw how cruel it is with these battery chickens and we buy free range eggs as well but organic is just not worth it for us
8764231 id be very phobic about having anything other than organic products and so i feel its necessary and something im prepared to pay for
8764232 i tend to cut out other things food is very fundamental to me
8764233 the offences for which our clients extradition is sought were committed on british soil and we maintain that any prosecution of our client ought therefore to be carried out by the appropriate british authorities
8764234 our client faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8764235 our clients case highlights a worrying trend where uk citizens are at the mercy of the ever increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country
8764236 it is a shame that the court of human rights will allow his extradition even as they consider whether us extradition measures were fair
8764237 like most people he didnt believe indian food could be eaten at lunchtime
8764238 which is phenomenal in the restaurant industry a good restaurant will do 150 covers
8764239 were not a restaurant where you go for an intimate dinner
8764240 were not a tandoori restaurant in tandoori restaurants you wont find a single indian customer
8764241 they make one large sauce boil the meat and if you want a korma and i want a madras the same chicken and the same sauce is used but you would have a bit of cream in yours and id have a bit of chilli in mine its served within 10 15 minutes and thats where the indian food market was developed
8764242 a lot of the recipes are inspired by my mum like the samosas
8764243 were not a fusion restaurant you wont find scallops or quails
8764244 one of the reasons for us buying bombay bicycle club was that more people are staying in and having a takeaway
8764245 a ladys bra is made out of 26 different components its all about learning how to make a product and ensuring its the best product of the highest quality i built my business around a lot of the ethos of marks amp spencer which is about never compromising on quality high customer service and running a business very tightly
8764246 my ambition is to get to 200 000 a day then ill be a happy man and hopefully a rich man at the same time
8764247 if the government soldiers or ethiopians suspect that you support al shabaab fighters from the islamist wing they will kill you in the street and vice versa
8764248 even if we have nothing else here we have security there is a dark future for somalia
8764249 ethiopia and the us have to think quickly about how they want to respond
8764250 is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing conditions is low
8764251 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8764252 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small quarter point cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8764253 with the economy set to contract over the next year the outlook for the housing market remains bleak
8764254 what began as a fall in prices is fast becoming a housing crash the governments public dithering over whether to offer a stamp duty holiday is making a bad problem worse
8764255 compared with other forecasters nationwide is usually conservative in its predictions of house price falls so when it tells us there is a big fall we know something very serious is happening all the signs are that we are at the beginning and not the end of a very painful process rather than dithering over crackpot schemes to prop up the housing market the government must act to help the many thousands in danger of losing their homes
8764256 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together
8764257 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8764258 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8764259 i dont think they are going to put on a case in the future with a lack of evidence
8764260 in a half changed world women often feel they need to choose mother or working your childrens will being or your own who does she think she is is a documentary by academy award winning filmmaker pamela tanner boll features five fierce women who refuse to choose through their lives we explore some of the most problematic intersections of our time othering and creativity partnering and independence economics and art the film invites us to consider both ancient legacies of women worshipped as cultural muses and more modern times where most people cant even name a handful of female artists

8764277 the human consequences for individuals of the things we do are there and very real that generates a pressure to do the job as well as we can which one feels particularly acutely when the decisions are controversial like this one
8764278 he showed a very very determined approach to this project
8764279 we went in there to say we have very real concerns he was courteous and polite and listened carefully and didnt move a millimetre on anything it was really firm resolve i think in his position i would have played it the same way he has got a tough job what we saw from nice throughout our dispute is a strengthening of their resolve to take very difficult decisions and stick with them
8764280 when i heard hed got the job i gave him a hug and a bouquet of flowers

8764283 people at that level are not affected by the public if they are good
8764284 i dont get told by anybody in government what to say
8764285 hes a quiet reasonable intelligent man in a very powerful position and i think he should be very much more critical of the government and opposition in terms of what needs to be done
8764286 in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that possession is for a purpose connected with the commission preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism

8764290 we dont want to just have a debate about whether the price should be five euro cents or 4 euro cents
8764291 we have got to ask about the future that may be uncomfortable for some people but i am not going to apologise for that
8764292 while the vast majority of us are happy with our mobiles and enjoy the experience there is a small but significant number who are dissatisfied
8764293 these figures show just how reliant the labour party is on the unions to stave off bankruptcy with the labour party divided and gordon brown vying for the title of britains weakest ever prime minister it is clear that ordinary donors are deserting brown and labours union paymasters are calling the shots
8764294 while we welcome the unions support it would be wrong to suggest that they are the sole source of the partys funding or that their financial support in any way gains them any undue influence in policy making trade union funding of political parties is the most open transparent and regulated of all party funding and is in stark contrast to the shadowy funding arrangements of the tories
8764295 its sad that his was the first head to roll and if his is the only one to roll that would be completely wrong
8764296 hes not the only person whos at risk in this whole scenario and its the fringe board itself that has something to answer for
8764297 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

8764304 the latest figures are excellent news for most passengers however the regular closure of parts of the network for engineering work causes substantial disruption and inconvenience to many passengers and freight customers as well as deterring others from using the network altogether
8764305 for rail to make its full contribution to our economy it is important that this disruption is reduced significantly we have been taking steps to ensure this happens
8764306 over the next five years nr must continue to carry out a full schedule of maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure together with a massive programme of enhancements to increase network capacity
8764307 we have been telling the industry for some time that passengers need accurate timely and coordinated information when engineering works take place
8764308 passengers recognise that engineering works are necessary and will tolerate some short term inconvenience for real long term gain but the rail industry should do more to inform passengers not only of the engineering works but also the benefits the work will bring
8764309 reducing disruption caused by improvement work is a central pillar of our plans in the years ahead delivering a railway at weekends to the standard we see during the week must be our goal and weve asked the orr for significant funds to make this seven day railway a reality
8764310 we are seeing the best levels of punctuality for 10 years with nine out of 10 trains running on time on many lines however we want to see further improvements and expect a major reduction in the delays which inconvenience rail users the most

8764332 entiendo la actitud del profe seg n el rbitro galv n le ment la madre pero yo escuch que los jugadores de del aurich le mentaron la madre en su cara y se hacia el loco en cambio dice que a 20 metros escuch a galv n f jense nos cobran todo en contra una mano m a en el rea es penal pero la mano de atl tico minero la fecha pasada no la cobraron los jugadores de aurich le mentan la madre al rbitro y no les dicen nada y a galv n lo expulsan

8764351 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8764352 why spend years holding difficult negotiations and looking for complicated compromises in ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the parties and push it to kill the other party and the job is done
8764353 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8764354 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8764355 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8764356 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8764363 the four times boston marathon winner knew that she was ahead of the pack but suffered a rude shock when she saw romanian constantina tomescu headed for the national olympic stadium to steal the olympic marathon gold medal with ndereba having to contend with the silver kenyas first medal at these games
8764364 i didnt see her breaking away and after all i normally run my own race and i dont look at other athletes even tomescu knows that i thought i was in the lead and only when we got to the stadium i saw her and was a bit surprised but it was too late to do anything if id seen her earlier definitely i would have pushed
8764365 my strategy was to start strong and finish strong because god says he is the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end

8764376 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
8764377 for this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make special request for you asking that you may be filled with the full deep and clear knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things that you may walk live and conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him and desiring to please him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of god with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition we pray that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory to exercise every kind of endurance and patience perseverance and forbearance with joy giving thanks to the father

8764386 when its time for gossip here are some handy names fulano mengano y sutano
8764387 no these are not the names of the three stooges they are monikers that are used to refer to people without using their given names many costa ricans use one of these for example when they cant think of a persons real name its sort of like in english or as the germans say dinksbumps a story in which these three characters appear might go something like this you know that fulano son of old don mengano the guy who owns the general store anyhow this fulano bought a used piece of junk motorcycle off some sutano who lives in the first house after you cross the old bridge the interesting thing is that these three characters also have the same apellido or last name which is de tal meaning so and so when you refer to a person as fulano de tal it means he is someone you dont really care much about one way or the other a mengano de tal or menganito is someone you might feel sorry for and sutano de tal is someone you dont know at all a perfect stranger fulano mengano and sutano also have wives they are fulanita menganita and sutanita so when you are annoyed with the woman who does your shirts you can tell your friend about that little fulanita down at the laundry who parades around like some kind of movie queen but all shes really after is poor menganitas husband another way to use these pseudonyms is to make reference to somebody who is just too amazingly stupid for example you might say to a friend whom you wish to dissuade from making a tremendous blunder no seas tan fulano meaning dont be such an idiot or you could comment on a person who is acting foolishly by saying ese fulano si es menso or that imbecile is really stupid but the general principle is always the same to camouflage albeit at times rather thinly someones real name
8764388 we have a pretty good idea of what causes ice to melt

8764394 i did but i believe the plan is flawed they are not as stupid as you may think
8764395 its now or never the fact that you are a bit too freaking nosey for your own good lynn is probably what made this so believable but i am sure they are convinced that this is in fact the lab
8764396 ok and another slight plan adjustment you need to go out the other way though he tunnel and hope it doesnt collapse when i set the charges i am sure they are watching the building right now it is a good thing the door faces this side instead of the other but i have to report in after i set the bombs so get going

8764411 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8764412 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8764413 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8764414 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8764415 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8764416 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach

8764435 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8764436 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8764437 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8764438 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8764439 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8764440 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8764441 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8764450 i dont buy as much organic food as i used to simple as that
8764451 i tend to look at the lower cost cheaper brands rather than the brands i went for before
8764452 and also where i used to buy free range and organic foods i tend to steer away from them now
8764453 we saw the chicken programme some weeks ago on the television and we saw how cruel it is with these battery chickens and we buy free range eggs as well but organic is just not worth it for us
8764454 id be very phobic about having anything other than organic products and so i feel its necessary and something im prepared to pay for

8764478 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8764479 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8764480 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8764481 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8764482 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
8764483 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

8764487 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
8764488 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
8764489 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
8764490 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
8764491 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8764492 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8764493 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8764494 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
8764495 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
8764496 you dont wait around in a hot rental market like this
8764497 as ghoulish as it sounds people will rent that place in a heartbeat
8764498 people are always on my case about my leggings or not wearing a bra with this uniform whos going to bust my shit its wholesome it reminds everybody how awesome their high school experience was and if youre bored at work you can cut out my photo and turn me into your fantasy football teams mascot

8764502 he drew a circle that excluded me so i drew a circle that included him
8764503 i think there is a balance but at every political convention there are celebrities that come
8764504 an opportunity for 80 000 people who might otherwise not have been able to participate to get involved
8764505 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8764506 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8764507 that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8764508 he spun those bolts so fast that i had to go back and check them
8764509 he picks corn out of his teeth just like everyone else
8764510 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it

8764517 the beads are held on with beeswax there are probably 800 beads maybe more
8764518 we have art made from horsehair from potato dough from corn husks from gourds from wood from shells from stone
8764519 even when theres gold and silver its not a lot our jewelers make 50 pieces a year and dont take more metal than they need
8764520 even gallery owners are almost totally ignorant about native american art that isnt from north america
8764521 if i go to africa i want something from africa
8764522 sometimes people are worried that the art is so cheap
8764523 its 69 if somebody made it today it would be a couple hundred
8764524 now theyre 850 because i know ill never get more pieces like these
8764525 when you have visitors who want to go to galleries you take them to the west side
8764526 i would love to have a mexican food and a nursery together with the gallery
8764527 sadly we frequently see patients admitted to a hospital with a devastating stroke who are known to have atrial fibrillation yet were either not taking warfarin or were taking a dose that is not therapeutic we consider these to be potentially preventable strokes
8764528 on one hand we have an extremely effective and cheap medication for stroke prevention warfarin yet on the other hand it remains under used in people who would benefit most from it
8764529 on average caregivers only slept about six and a half hours a night and took almost 23 minutes to fall asleep
8764530 using the sleep diary data that subjects kept at the same time however depression was the primary determinant of poor sleep with depressed subjects reporting less time asleep and more wake time over the week
8764531 based on the available information and reports it appears that this outbreak is over
8764532 by early august the number of cases was down to the number of cases we would expect to see anyway in the absence of a major outbreak there are some cases of this infection that occur every year

8764534 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment

8764537 one is that they dont know how to walk not walking they become deconditioned and lose cardiovascular fitness with the treadmill type of training you improve walking and also increase fitness
8764538 the most important clinical aspect of the study is that it is saying recovery can occur long after a stroke and can occur even after all the routine therapies have been tried
8764539 scientifically the most important point appears to be that rewiring of the brain may be involved in this process not just body conditioning
8764540 i think i just had a lot more power than she did
8764541 i think it still could be better especially i was 4 1 up in the first set and then i let it go to 4 4

8764545 the support we have received from southern electric has been wonderful we are currently running a three year appeal to build equip and run jacksplace and this donation will make a significant difference to achieving our goal
8764546 we are delighted that the teams singled out the hospice and would like to thank everyone involved

8764548 we are proud that our teams safe working practices have resulted in this gift being made possible for important new facilities such as jacksplace

8764550 theres no question that i could not take a drug its been a life saver if drugs companies are not going to bother because they do not get a return its going to affect the development costs and it will affect the whole process of bringing drugs to the market

8764570 we want to be happily married 50 years from now
8764571 just to get to this point to receive the nomination is a great triumph because no one in my generation ever believed i would say that this could be possible
8764572 i believe its a great opportunity for all americans to see that no matter what the stereotypes have been in the past that african americans can be contributors to the overall society
8764573 now i have a real example that i can use to show these children that yes you can do anything you can do anything
8764574 i would like to go to bed really early and she would stay up late it would like bother each other
8764575 i like more space more quiet time to study and stuff that was kinda hard for me to study with someone else in the room
8764576 their actual assignment is made with live individuals sitting around a table saying it sounds like these two connect together
8764577 ninety percent of the class very very much cares what their homebase is going to be like
8764578 i felt horrible when they roommates would break up its like oh my gosh did i do that you know and there is a lot of pride that goes into that from our staff
8764579 we leave probably a half a dozen rooms available every year so were prepared for a little bit of roommate shuffle thats going to happen
8764580 its a person to person relationship that they truly have to work for but knowing roommates can often become life long friends the hope here is that fewer students decide to get more space away from their fellow classmates by choosing less space to live in
8764581 weve got 26 percent of our oil production capacity right in that gulf of mexico region as well as 42 percent of the stockpiles so thats the worst areas that could possibly be hit and unfortunately gustav is tracking right that way
8764582 the oil companies have to evacuate all those platforms they have to ride out the storm and then before they can begin production again obviously theyve got to get their crews back out there they have to do their safety inspections so basically were looking at an entire week without any production out of that region and thats in a best case scenario
8764583 so immeadiately that had an impact on todays crude prices we were up around 119 a barrel this morning that dropped down to 115 at the end of trading

8764586 my favorite quote is on floor 2 which is ralph waldo emerson health is your greatest wealth
8764587 it helps you get through your day gives you kind of a little boost to deal with things that come up during the day
8764588 i always think about that what a great opportunity for people to easily fit in a little bit of a workout in their day
8764589 over the years id spent a great deal of time studying with my son and daughter after school making flash cards cutting and pasting in word and verbally quizzing at the kitchen table but our interaction wasnt always as uplifting and positive as it could be
8764590 i realized i was actually doing my children a disservice because they were not organizing their own study materials i was

8764592 my grandmother was quite the entrepreneur in her younger years and loved that my idea involved education she had graduated from high school in the 1920s and had continued on to secretarial school providing her with solid training for the then male dominated business world
8764593 when people receive our gift cards they are amazed our gift cards are works of art in their own right we took our cues from retailers like tiffany and nordstrom and have brought gift cards to a new level
8764594 when we first launched our baby shower gift cards last year people questioned the business sense of a gift card thats so beautiful yet costly but our strategy has absolutely paid off we see each gift card as much more than a transactional tool its an introduction to our brand and to our company and we want it to be special and memorable by including actual sample product with each gift certificate we tend to wow each and every person at the gift giving event we love what our unique gift cards have done for the business

8764605 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

8764607 la perla es un sitio de costa y all los muchachos si no tienen grandes estudios pueden tener un trabajo con la pesca porque para la pesca lo que hay que tener es deseo de trabajar
8764608 yo les ense o porque esto hace falta y si no se aprende la pesca se muere en este pa s
8764609 aqu he tenido una gran experiencia antes me hablaban de que la perla era el sitio m s malo de san juan pero he visto la otra cara de la moneda muchachos con mucho entusiasmo para aprender y progresar
8764610 como yo aprend con otros tengo que ense ar a los muchachos les expliqu que lo primero que se monta son las costillas que las hacemos con cortes exactos despu s se pica la madera para cada lado del bote

8764624 we could have the most powerful anti hacking force in the world but wed still have no computers so we couldnt do anything
8764625 the government thinks about guns tanks and raiding houses hackers just arent a priority
8764626 now the government is starting to use computers everywhere but these computers arent protected
8764627 if that information had fallen into the hands of terrorists it would have been a catastrophe
8764628 how we think about licenses is getting a bit more nuanced
8764629 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative license they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licenses that are readily combinable with epl code
8764630 we have decided that after nearly 2 years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers
8764631 in the market in wajid i picked up an egg and i asked how much it was do you know that egg cost 20 us cents
8764632 that is more than five times what it cost six months ago thats just too much
8764633 im telling the somalis enough enough 18 years theyve been at war and i think its the right time now that they sit together
8764634 they must figure out some way to find peace because building more camps like dadaab is not the solution
8764635 barack obama will transform our economy by making alternative energy a genuine national priority creating 5 million new jobs and finally freeing us from the grip of foreign oil thats the change we need
8764636 janganlah kamu mengasihi dunia dan apa yang ada di dalamnya jikalau orang mengasihi dunia maka kasih akan bapa tidak ada di dalam orang itu
8764637 pergilah menghadap firaun dan berbicaralah kepadanya beginilah firman tuhan allah orang ibrani biarkanlah umat ku pergi supaya mereka beribadah kepada ku
8764638 sebab kamu tahu bahwa kamu telah ditebus dari cara hidupmu yang sia sia yang kamu warisi dari nenek moyangmu itu bukan dengan barang yang fana bukan pula dengan perak atau emas melainkan dengan darah yang mahal yaitu darah kristus yang sama seperti darah anak domba yang tak bernoda dan tak bercacat

8764645 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
8764646 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
8764647 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control
8764648 ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now
8764649 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8764650 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8764651 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8764652 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8764653 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8764654 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8764655 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8764656 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8764657 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8764658 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8764659 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8764660 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet
8764661 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8764662 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8764663 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8764664 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8764665 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8764666 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8764667 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8764668 gonblick kommer och f rsvinner s det g ller att vara beredd
8764669 you have got people encouraged to buy a block of land way out of the city and they are having to travel for three hours a day to commute thats not sustainable
8764670 people there live in town houses or terrace houses the houses are never one storey and you have got the population that lives closer to the city
8764671 we have to curtail land subdivisions at the extremities of the city the other option is to put in some very fast trains to regional centres somewhere like geelong could be an attractive destination for working and living
8764672 the population is still growing and theres a demand for these properties
8764673 its near impossible to dictate to the market what should happen
8764674 basically he asked that everybody work out their differences and at least talk to each other
8764675 honest discussions between the city and the businesses that have to be relocated are critical
8764676 is a big proponent of economic development across the state
8764677 we still hope to remain an acute care facility but we presented a restructuring plan to the state in conjunction with the closing plan
8764678 some of our space and resources to other types of health care
8764679 they are just reviewing our proposal for restructuring to determine whether or not it meets their specifications
8764680 rumors are just that and when they are not substantiated and they are still reported as if they were news then they create very serious problems

8764682 friday saturday night and the afternoon thats going to be a jammed up situation
8764683 before they would ever be able to get that on theyre going to have to figure out how to get cars in and out
8764684 a lot of tourists cant even find the front entrance trying to get into a cab or limo
8764685 that is basically a gimmick trying to keep the monorail alive

8764687 but a lot of kids emulate that look now so its hard

8764731 pat mccrory says he wants to change the political culture but hes bringing george bushs special interests and failed policies to north carolina and hes doing it with open arms

8764746 thanks for all your work so far now why dont you just sit back and enjoy the ride
8764747 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone

8764750 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8764751 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8764752 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8764753 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8764754 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8764755 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational

8764767 fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battlefield of that war we are met to dedicate a portion of it as the final resting place of those who here gave their lives that the nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly carried on it is rather fo us to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that the nation shall under god have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth

8764792 we prefer the policy of immediate sterilizarion of making sure that parenthood is absolutely prohibited to the feeble minded
8764793 the danger to the community of the unsegregated feeble minded woman is more evident most dangerous are the middle and high grades living at large who despite the fact that their defect is not easily recognizable should nevertheless be prevented from procreation in my view we should act without delay
8764794 i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question
8764795 we also recognize the importance of good medical care for women that were also recognizing the importance of age appropriate education to reduce risks i do believe that contraception has to be part of that education process
8764796 i think that most americans recognize that this is a profoundly difficult issue partial birth abortion for the women and families who make these decisions they dont make them casually and i trust women to make these decisions in conjunction with their doctors and their families and their clergy and i think thats where most americans are
8764797 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
8764798 as an ardent practicing catholic uh this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and uh senator uh im senator uh st augustin sic said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child uh eh er first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester the the theres very clear distinctions
8764799 and this is like 50 years or something like that so again over the history uh of the church this is an issue of uh controversy

8764865 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8764866 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8764867 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way

8764902 in beijing i had to really focus on one event at a time and once that event was done i had to put it behind me thats just sort of where my mind frame was during the meet and once it was over i dont think everything has really set in but i think over the next few months and years i think it really will set in and im proud of everything that ive done and im happy i had this opportunity
8764903 all had sort of like a group huddle and we were talking a little bit about you know sort of the real definition of teamwork and what it means to each and every one of us were all just thankful to have he team we had and that we were able to be successful
8764904 the medals are a little crooked but its a cool shot when i first was taking it i had never had them all on at once and i never realized how heavy it was but it was a fun picture and im glad i was able to take it like that it looks pretty cool i think
8764905 some people will always want to be inprivate but there is a trade off
8764906 if the hype around privacy gains more credibility more people will hit the private button there is a potential threat here to click through advertising

8764908 were continually working to strengthen our squad and once we identify the individuals we would like to bring in we will utilize our strong relationship with mls to secure those players services
8764909 i have no idea who the source is for this story but its absolute nonsense
8764910 its difficult to respond to blog entries where unknown sources are referenced and of course blogs are driven by hits not necessarily by the same standards as print media
8764911 start opening her eyes and realise who the people using her are
8764912 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone to all the media in the world
8764913 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again and wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same
8764914 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8764915 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful
8764916 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction
8764917 i was angry when i first read his attack on me but i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him
8764918 an incomplete story referencing apple was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today
8764919 the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8764920 werent life threatening and he doesnt have a recurrence of cancer
8764921 revealed 8 million victims in the worlds biggest cyber heist
8764922 theres some fabulous tailoring and menswear this year is quite exceptional
8764923 when you are investing heavily in the community it is a real kick in the guts
8764924 this memorandum of understanding with a like minded organisation like north coast tafe is a prime example of this sort of fresh approach
8764925 we are also focusing together on the employment of aboriginal trainees and providing cultural awareness programmes for a range of staff
8764926 the officers of the church by whom all its powers are administered are according to the scriptures teaching and ruling elders and deacons
8764927 since the pca book of church order does not allow women to be ordained as deacons is it appropriate 1 for particular pca congregations to nominate elect and commission men and women as deacons and then 2 not to ordain either these men or women does the pca allow for this practice
8764928 to the office of deacon which is spiritual in nature shall be chosen men of spiritual character honest repute exemplary lives brotherly spirit warm sympathies and sound judgment
8764929 every church shall elect person to the office of ruling elder and deacon keeping in mind that each prospective officer should be an active male member who meets the qualifications set forth in 1 timothy 3 and titus 1
8764930 the question as to whether or not it is appropriate to ordain women as deacons has been one that has arisen in recent decades in the associate reformed presbyterian church and has been discussed in the courts of other presbyterian denominations as well
8764931 the modern debate regarding the ordination of women to the diaconate began in the 1880s about twenty years after the rise of what has been called christian feminism during the late 1880s a move to ordain women to the diaconate failed in the presbyterian church in the united states of america pcusa but passed in the reformed presbyterian church of north america rpcna the debate over women deacons re emerged in the 1980s about twenty years after the rise of secular and pagan feminism
8764932 the revivalists permitted women to pray and speak publicly and even to become exhorters teaching assistants they began to speak of women as being more naturally religious than men and urged wives to be the means of converting their more worldly husbands
8764933 the protestant reformation for all its opposition to romanism never questioned the practice of ordaining men only now if this practice has continued from the time of abraham down to 1960 or thereabouts those who are innovators surely must bear the burden of proof the westminster confession indeed says all synods may err and many have erred therefore it is theoretically possible that the reformed presbyterian church is in error but when the agreement is worldwide over 4 000 years it is i repeat extremely improbable therefore a mountainous burden of proof rests on those who advocate the ordination of women
8764934 there was of course a time when such a practice would never have been entertained for a moment in the a r p church which has always professed to maintain the infallibility and the final authority of holy scripture however some have more recently voiced a desire that the a r p church needs to get more in step with the world and with sundry denominations which seem to revere the holy writ even less
8764935 does the ordination of women to the diaconate represent a vestige of liberalism within the ranks of the a r p and other presbyterian and reformed denominations which profess to hold to biblical inerrancy this question must be answered
8764936 what this provision asserts is that words have meaning and specific definitions there are expressed provisions without the pca constitution that direct the definition use and meaning of titles phrases processes and doctrines the pca has chosen to express within its polity certain words and concepts which define and distinguish the nature of the office gifts and those who are qualified to serve in these regular and perpetual offices
8764937 do you sincerely receive and adopt the confession of faith catechisms
8764938 we need the support of the local community now more than ever said amy caffarello executive director st
8764939 while donations are needed to meet the increased demand for st joseph the workers services employment leads for our clients are equally necessary competition in the job market is as high as its ever been
8764940 we are seeing more and more individuals that have lost their jobs and their homes due to downsizing lay offs or reductions in the workforce
8764941 st joseph the worker encounters skilled and professional workers from all industries we ask local companies to send us their job openings and leads so we can send motivated qualified workers to them
8764942 we are grateful for the community support that allows st joseph the worker to help others help themselves
8764943 each of these successful clients is now a dedicated employee that is able to contribute back to the community
8764944 is the elected official in charge of billions of dollars in new mexicos investment portfolio
8764945 having the critical habitat provides a stronger set of protection for the species and to ensure that its not just about the survival of individuals but recovery for the species as a whole
8764946 we did our best in 2001 but weve come along ways in terms of mapping and how we refined our criteria for what is considered essential habitat
8764947 there are huge development pressures but also why people move there is for the beauty of the natural landscape
8764948 if we cant keep areas that allow the bighorn sheep alive what are we going to have but barren hillsides
8764949 you have a combination of two things some milder than normal summer weather and also were anticipating an 8 percent increase in natural gas production over last year
8764950 its not secure to put your content on the web
8764951 speak boldly to the american people they want to get out of iraq
8764952 im going to withdraw from iraq as fast as ships and planes can carry them
8764953 i will withdraw in 16 months and will send some troops to afghanistan and keep some troops in iraq for security purposes
8764954 just let me live till voting time in november in my lifetime we just might get to see the first african american president
8764955 its unfathomable to the public how this board could take in excess of 50 000 tickets every july
8764956 how not one of you could question the morals and ethics of that decision if it were my decision the board would get no tickets in the future because of the abuse of the past
8764957 i believe that the freebies should be zero premium tickets to your buddies im opposed to that thats not a symbol of good government to the public
8764958 its very insulting for me and my fellow board members to be called all these names
8764959 ive been on the board for three years and never had a situation where anyone had wanted to comment on a public vote
8764960 what happened was an anomaly and we werent prepared to handle it
8764961 obrigam os membros do cas a desenvolver uma an lise comum
8764962 existe o consenso de que esta situa o definir as oportunidades e desafios para os pa ses membros do cas alguns grandes produtores e outros com um forte potencial na produ o de alimentos

8764965 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8764966 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick at the time and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented to him
8764967 our organization is trying to make bicycling more easily used for work
8764968 i dont even know if it really matters whether she wins or not
8764969 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8764970 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8764971 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8764972 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8764973 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8764974 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8764975 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8764976 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8764977 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8764978 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8764979 its a big step to actually put it out there
8764980 i remember what roberto de vicenzo once said to me
8764981 if you shoot under 70 everybody will understand you if you dont they wont want to talk to you anyway
8764982 the best way to achieve academic results is to invest in teachers and in school leadership
8764983 they finland only accept into teacher training one out of 10 candidates who want to study to become a teacher it is a very reputable career
8764984 absolutely every teacher must have at least master level graduate
8764985 they have to have a university based study and it takes five years
8764986 telstra will roll out another hired gun to talk about competition and regulation in the australian telecommunications sector this week but scratch beneath the surface of the factual analysis telstras expert presents and you will find little more than false assumptions and bias
8764987 the report unsurprisingly concurs with telstras own views that structural separation is unnecessary in australia it follows the telstra party line because the analysis is drawn exclusively from information provided by telstra with no input from its wholesale customers or competitors
8764988 the uk form of separation was designed to address severe problems of non price discrimination which on the basis of evidence i have seen do not exist in australia and i would not recommend that the uk form of separation be used as a starting point in the australian context i am also of the view that more radical measures such as structural separation would involve substantially escalated risk and costs the demand risks and uncertainties associated with building an ngn especially where it is intended to replace the pstn seem to me to raise doubts about whether a non vertically integrated approach would be able to achieve the necessary level of investment co ordination
8764989 written on the basis of a review of the relevant documentation including accc reports on telstras non price performance and a week long trip to australia during which i met telstra executives i did not interview executives or stakeholders outside telstra
8764990 it would appear mr meek has fallen into the same trap as another telstra commissioned mouth piece professor martin cave
8764991 if mr meek were interested in presenting a true picture of competition and regulation in the australian market he would have talked to any number of telstras wholesale customers local industry bodies or stakeholders
8764992 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8764993 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8764994 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8764995 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8764996 kinda like the kurds being told to revolt in iraq and well support them in the early 90s
8764997 he got that idea from the america haters on the drudge retort
8764998 but ive made it clear to the science team that the warrantys over
8764999 the vehicle is not going to tip over and die
8765000 but were getting to the point where were going to start seeing the creaks and groans
8765001 were in that mode now where were collecting a lot of data
8765002 everybody is so busy trying to make hay as the sun shines literally and figuratively that we havent had a chance to take a breath to see what the biggest science find has been
8765003 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8765004 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8765005 i cant wait to meet him ive seen him on tv
8765006 i started playing the saxophone in year 2 and when i changed schools i took up playing in the band again
8765007 we have been building up our garden in the seven years we have lived here and it has been a place of much comfort and delight to us
8765008 the damage caused here last thursday when some statues were broken and ripped out of the ground was shocking enough
8765009 but the discovery of the latest damage really upset us
8765010 one statue had been pulled out of the ground and taken over to the other side of our front yard
8765011 another one worth about 90 must have been stolen because we cant find it anywhere
8765012 both those figures were concreted into the ground so they must have used strong implements to dig them up
8765013 we made our front garden such a happy place and these statues have cost me a fortune over the time we have been here
8765014 its reached the stage where we may not be able to keep nice things in our front garden
8765015 and of course we are anxious about what might happen in the future
8765016 who knows if our car or even our house might be hit next
8765017 i am really angry about what has happened but we are not just sitting around and waiting
8765018 we are installing some surveillance lighting and putting in other security measures that i dont want to talk about
8765019 it started off with only one or two people in 1999 but we had to expand to accommodate the demand
8765020 weve got 12 staff and a broad range of contract trainers and consultants now
8765021 perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the development of the institute has been the degree to which it has attracted statewide participation national profile and now international interest in its programs
8765022 it would be particularly beneficial to tenants when they vacate a property instead of leaving their unwanted items behind
8765023 by allowing all residents in maitland one free tip entry a year we will see less illegal dumping
8765024 from the charity i work for the dumping of rubbish in and around our bins is costing more than 25 000 per year
8765025 i dont want to have to move because i cant afford the taxes
8765026 the donaldson sponsorship will be used for the salary of the graphic designer and the naming of the new childrens space to be known as the art factory
8765027 our donation will assist with the training and employment of a graphic designer the money has been taken out of the donaldson coal employment trust to specifically train and employ somebody at the art gallery
8765028 we have a great affiliation with the art gallery because the business has been situated in maitland since 1996 and we still have strong ties to maitland such as working at the original donaldson site
8765029 basically we are interested in developing a number of aspects in maitland and the art gallery is a key cultural resource
8765030 its a total revitalisation of that site particularly with the organic supermarket moving into the former hardware building
8765031 theyve just put in traffic lights at that intersection of lawes and william streets and an upgrade of the landscaping of lawes street itself
8765032 it wasnt all that difficult to agree to the single storey
8765033 i could have stuck to my guns but probably having two additional single storey units is more beneficial to accommodate more retirees
8765034 i went and spent quite a bit of time with the neighbours so thats been a good outcome
8765035 i still feel its a massive overdevelopment in a heritage area
8765036 in any other part of the city it would be good
8765037 weve forwarded them a lot of information and theyre just going through that at the moment
8765038 weve been trying to gather some evidence and were telling them the kind of stuff weve been saying for months that its not a mystery and theres a long history
8765039 seeing that were not getting anywhere its been going on for so long and people are so ill we decided to consider a class action
8765040 its just early days its just a shame that it has to come to this
8765041 as time goes on were getting more and more information
8765042 people have been complaining for years and nothing is happening
8765043 its just a shame that organisations that are set up to make sure this doesnt happen are totally ineffective and communities have to resort to this
8765044 simplemente fue quien revoluciono la era de los videojuegos fue quien se atr segunda versi n de prueba para internet explorer 8
8765045 va a mostrar sus razones para el cambio va a establecer sus apuestas sobre esta elecci n los riesgos de continuar por el camino por el que vamos que es sencillamente lo que el senador mccain est ofreciendo
8765046 were definitely being treated as press by the people that matter
8765047 im a party person turned new media not the other way around thats why it was shocking to me
8765048 they allow the opportunity to take a story and really report on it without being in fear of a crazy editor
8765049 as tight as ive seen security anywhere in 20 years
8765050 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the u s specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8765051 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8765052 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8765053 they were acting in implementing orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8765054 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8765055 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before aug 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8765056 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8765057 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8765058 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it just sounds not rational
8765059 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8765060 doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8765061 we are in the process of reevaluating our relationship with russia
8765062 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8765063 the humanitarian needs of conflict victims and those displaced by recent violence in georgia
8765064 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8765065 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before august 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area

8765083 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8765084 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8765085 im hoping to use this moment to put denver on the map
8765086 so we got all the civilians out around then hosted and hosted private party for the vips
8765087 we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8765088 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8765089 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8765090 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8765091 heller is aggressively pursuing other merger options of which the most promising is a combination with chicago based
8765092 has actively sought a merger in recent months to shore up the firm which lost as many as 25 partners and missed budget projections by 15 percent in 2007

8765096 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8765097 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8765098 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8765099 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8765100 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8765101 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8765102 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8765103 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8765112 were the real couple not you and jack not you and nick you and me
8765113 hard to know with brad but i think he will continue to try to break up jack amp sharon i wonder if jack will confront him about seeing him amp sharon together today i hope he asks her about it amp then tells brad off
8765114 im with you i cant dont like brad either and i agree that sharon and brad deserve each other i disagree about jack hes his own worst enemy and its now time for him to pay for some of the things that hes done with the exception of sharon and luan jack has cheated on all of his wives so i think they will probably need to bring in someone new for him
8765115 no one asked us where we lived or how much money we had when we enlisted and no one should ask us that after weve bled for our country
8765116 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8765117 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8765118 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8765119 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8765120 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8765121 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control
8765122 i go and help people in rehab thats control how can she say im out of control if theyre going to say im lying im out of control im going to show that theyre lying and theyre out of control
8765123 samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life
8765124 thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy
8765125 she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent
8765126 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8765127 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8765128 are not satisfied that this courts intervention by way of extraordinary writ is warranted at this time
8765129 i feel a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced
8765130 im very satisfied with the teams performance and their success has sparked a lot of excitement and passion for football across the country
8765131 football in india has also made a giant leap forward at club level with the first professional indian league beginning this year
8765132 during this period the team has played a total of 23 games and weve only lost three in the process we won the nehru cup in 2007 as well as this challenge cup victory
8765133 at the very beginning i made many changes to the team but now we have a relatively stable first eleven
8765134 quite a few young talents have broken into the senior side while the experienced players also have key roles
8765135 when i coached china in 1998 they had no overseas based players they simply didnt believe in themselves but after the teams encouraging results like the win over japan in the eaff championship some top players like fan zhiyi and sun jihai made high profile transfers to european clubs
8765136 we have a host of talented players like sunil chetri who has the potential to earn a move to europe
8765137 we must make the indian people believe their players can make it
8765138 qualifying for the asian cup is only our first goal and next well see about booking a place at the 2018 world cup
8765139 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8765140 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8765141 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8765142 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8765143 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8765144 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8765145 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8765146 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8765147 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8765148 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8765149 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8765150 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8765151 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8765152 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8765153 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8765154 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8765155 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8765156 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8765157 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8765158 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8765159 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8765160 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8765161 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8765162 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8765163 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8765164 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8765165 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8765166 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8765167 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8765168 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8765169 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8765170 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8765171 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8765172 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8765173 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8765174 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8765175 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8765176 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8765177 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8765178 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8765179 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8765180 shut up shut up for goodness sake rachel shut up
8765181 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8765182 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8765183 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8765184 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8765185 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8765186 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8765187 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8765188 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8765189 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8765190 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8765191 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8765192 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

8765194 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8765195 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8765196 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8765197 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8765198 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8765199 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8765200 well whats interesting about this is in the version that you saw on tv they didnt have microphones in the audience and when you actually hear what was going on in the audience you understand why congressman kucinich a democrat from ohio was getting so excited at the end of his speech heres what the speech sounded like when you actually hear the audience response
8765201 e verything was there except for ein volk ein reich ein f hrer
8765202 i mean this is pretty pretty amazing he kucinich has the same stature as a former orator
8765203 dont set up any more meetings with governors it makes absolutely no sense to do this if we dont have stability in the incentive programs
8765204 sure well need wind and solar energy but its just not cost effective yet
8765205 is to accelerate the introduction of new technologies for energy supply and use and deploy them on a very large scale

8765208 we have seen a small improvement in consumer confidence in august but this should not be seen as a turnaround in core sentiment
8765209 the improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence
8765210 we could not accurately forecast river flows and water levels without the data and support we receive from the usgs
8765211 when river and tide data are not available our job of forecasting is much more difficult and typically results in diminished accuracy of those forecasts

8765216 he is a young center who was very productive as a rebounder shotblocker and scorer at the rocky mountain revue summer league in salt lake city utah the 2008 olympics and the fiba diamond ball tournament in nanjing china prior to the olympics our coaching staff is eager to begin working with hamed
8765217 there was a huge noooo that went through the room when she said that
8765218 she said the election was about more than just personalities
8765219 its the same with the story of michelle obama and the story of barack obama
8765220 when theyve worked for head start and they experience the commitment to these families its so rewarding
8765221 we ask them what barriers are in their lives and how we can help them overcome them
8765222 we want to help them become a vital part of the community
8765223 thats the way its been predominantly a lot of the time
8765224 i think they kind of skip over me i like that because its less pressure for me we just do the best we can stay under the radar i guess and see what we can do
8765225 we still just havent got the chemistry between he and the crew chief and the team that we rebuilt to be where its at its absolute best but theyre very close to being able to do the deal
8765226 if we could just win a race and get that behind us i think everybody would be a little bit more relaxed
8765227 the reason he hasnt won is just because we havent had our cars fast enough but hes been close
8765228 he should have won two or three times this year maybe he can be a contender for a championship and have the best part of his year after the chase starts
8765229 it was a long green run day and i ran third the rest of the day
8765230 but a lap down third and every time the caution would come out the leaders were passing lapped cars again and i never got the lucky dog
8765231 i finished 20th and we ended up losing the championship by 35 points all we needed was a top 10 there and i had the championship won
8765232 thats kind of sore i guess but hopefully it wont happen this year if we get in
8765233 youve got to put yourself in that position to be able to win a race
8765234 youre not going to win from running 20th youre going to be in position running in the top five
8765235 tavitas a lot better in year two in the system than he was in year one
8765236 i expect him to be even better a month from now four months from now and a year from now tavita has an excellent grasp of the offense
8765237 the number one thing you would have to say is the difference in lyle from this year to last year is confidence
8765238 that then relates right into speed of play and decision making understanding and the ability to take something that has happened and transform it into a positive
8765239 ever since we found out he was granted his redshirt year weve been doing great things
8765240 hes been able to help me help him out and the rest of the offense hes doing a great job of being one of the leaders out there and having him back in the offense is something special
8765241 with stanford they have a new defensive coordinator wed like to see them play before we play them we cant do that in some ways its a little bit of a mystery going in and its a conference opponent you put all that stuff together and it makes for a very interesting start
8765242 but i have already paid for it and i have a line of people behind me to establish that fact
8765243 you want to see what the kids are like under fire
8765244 you never know until its live im glad were playing an early game i think we got a big jump on things from the summer workouts
8765245 are we going to be sharp i doubt it will we make mistakes yes but will we be ready to play i think so the kids are looking forward to a game
8765246 other than their quarterback and receivers i dont know much about them
8765247 their quarterback is their best athlete and they seem pretty physical and have a lot of experience i think theyll throw the kitchen sink at us and do a lot of things
8765248 we have to be prepared to adjust for what they show us
8765249 hes a tough kid and loves football he gives us another running threat
8765250 we know were a huge underdog and the chances are even worse than david and goliath
8765251 we dont have enough stones up here but were looking forward to it
8765252 anybody that plays sports should go in expecting to win
8765253 all you guys like to refer to the michigan game and ill refer to it too
8765254 we had very few penalties seven against michigan our kicking game two field goals was pretty solid against michigan those two things alone kept us in the game it gave us a chance and the way it turned out a mistake in the kicking game probably cost michigan an opportunity to win the game
8765255 in our passing game its going to be quick throws getting the ball out as quick as we can
8765256 well try to run away from them and make them chase us hopefully theyll get tired by the second half
8765257 obviously theyre a quality program but playing a team like michigan with tradition like that it was definitely surprising
8765258 i guess were just preparing we respect all of our opponents and well be ready to go like any other week
8765259 were looking forward to it i think both schools are looking forward to it
8765260 theyre the defending national champions so are we even though theres a huge gap in there and lsu knows that just as well as we do its a great challenge for us
8765261 from day one ive made it our business to put the needs of the individual investor first and for 30 years weve kept our clients interest as our main focus creating a true wall street alternative for all investors

8765264 when it comes to the golden goal it is all about capitalising on every opportunity and my boys did exactly that

8765371 would you stop using alex salmond in your speeches youre giving him a platform he doesnt deserve
8765372 the thing people like about alex salmond is not his policies but that his leadership is confident

8765384 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8765385 success is not final failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts
8765386 ive never seen a more disorganized way of doing things in my life lets leave it there
8765387 preaching is one great and noble part of the pastoral duty preaching is an ordinance of heaven and therefore is not to be declaimed against as lowly or superfluous
8765388 how vile are they who despise prophesying and forsake the assembling of themselves together as the manner of some is and who load faithful preachers with the most contemptuous indignities
8765389 let none think it a disparagement to his greatness to be employed in preaching the gospel and grow too big for this work as if it were fit only for men of low degree and those least esteemed in the church to excel here is true dignity and glory
8765390 christ is the center of revelation and the adequate subject of preaching and he must be the substance and bottom of every sermon whatever the subject ministers are upon it must somehow point to christ so all duty must be persuaded to and preached up with due regard unto christ to his authority commanding and to his spirit of grace assisting as well as to the merit of his blood commending thus in imitation of the apostolic way of preaching there must be a a beautiful texture of references to christ a golden thread twisted into every discourse to leaven and perfume it so as to make it express a savor of the knowledge of christ
8765391 ministers then must study to feed their flocks with a continual feast on the glorious fullness there is in christ the must gather fruits from the branch of righteousness from the tree of life for those who hunger not feeding them with the meat which perishes but with that which endures to everlasting life they must open this fountain of living waters the great mystery of godliness into which all the doctrines of the gospel that are branched forth into so great a variety do as so many rivulets or streams making glad the city of god flow and concenter
8765392 on the one side as to counsel and advice ministers must be willing and industrious to instruct the servile as the honorable the poor among the brethren as well as the rich in the world they must beware not to compliment quality and distinction nor court popular influence and plentiful fortunes
8765393 they must be orthoprax as well as orthodox unto purity of doctrine they must add unspotted piety of life and transcribe their public sermons in their private visible actions and behavior if ever they would preserve the dignity of their character or promote the efficacy of gospel truths
8765394 the truths of the gospel must be presented to the understanding in the most intelligible language with perspicuity and ease of expression when ministers study to be florid rather than solid and labor continually for lofty phrases and great swelling words of vanity they are only spinning a spiders web the prater perhaps may win applause but the minister in the mean time may not win a soul the divine end of preaching
8765395 observe the design and intent of the apostle in all his administrations that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus col 1 28 what he aimed at was to lead men into a saving acquaintance and living union with christ to life them into his service to mold them into his image to take them off from the old stock of corrupt nature and to insert them into the true vine unto this end was the bent and ambition of his soul that was the vital motive of all his study and diffusive labors
8765396 hence it behooves ministers to be very much in the exercise of prayer they who would become fit for and faithful in the ministry of the word must give themselves to prayer continually the more fervent and frequent one is at the throne of grace the better prospect he has of excelling in strength of growing mighty in the scriptures and being skillful in the word of righteousness
8765397 hence ministers must be content with their lords dispensations and allotments to them let not then the men of low degree and of small account in their fathers house who are forced to creep in the dust and lift up plowshares and pruning hooks instead of swords and spears look upon themselves with discouragement and discontent neither with envy and emulation upon others who move in a higher sphere distinguished with brighter visions and more abudant honor
8765398 but here let me pass to the other part of that phrase which worketh in me mightily col 1 29 hence we note that the lord jesus christ is the author of all success in the work of the ministry the efficacy of the word preached is not owing to the influence of mens wisdom and eloquence it does not depend upon dint of argument the charms of moral persuasion nor upon the natural energy of virtue of the word itself or any external means but it is to be attributed entirely to the special operations of christ
8765399 hence let ministers be entirely resigned to christ the lord of the harvest as to the fruit of their labors though they spend their strength for naught and in vain all the day long stretch out their hand to a gainsaying and rebellious people yet surely their judgment is with the lord and their work with god if they so much though they reap little or nothing though the vineyard does not yield fruit meet for them by whom it is dressed not receiving the blessing from god but degenerates into a howling wilderness or barren desert bearing thorns and briars nigh unto cursing or at most affords only the gleaning of the vintage yet let this administer comfort to the faithful servants of christ that they have discharged their duty and acted their part the lack of success shall be no bar to their acceptance for they are unto god a sweet savor of christ in them who are saved and a stench in them who parish the battle is the lords not theirs he umpires the success of every campaign
8765400 hence then faithful ministers may expect from the lord jesus christ all those supplies of both skill and strength that they need in order to fulfill their ministry
8765401 the most divine preacher is but an instrument the excellency of the power is of christ and therefore the excellency of dignity and the praise of all owes to him let ministers then ascribe unto him the glory that is due unto him sing forth the honor of his praise and make his name glorious
8765402 heb 13 17 1 thess 5 12 13 let them who labor among you experience your candor pity and kind assistance at all times and in all things do all you can to alleviate their burdens and by all possible means endeavor to hearten and comfort them lend a hand to strengthen and further them in their work cast the mantle of christian charity over the multitude of their weaknesses and defects do not be too severe in animadverting on them at any time but make all ingenuous allowances for their imperfections always put the fairest gloss upon their speech and behavior remember that they are earthen vessels and your own vessels at that and take heed that you dont throw them to the ground and dash them to pieces upon spying a little flaw and to all this do not fail to add your most importunate intercessions for them at the throne of grace

8765512 i remember the first image that came to me was of a little girl just scratching out in red earth in dry dead land with insects chirruping anxiously around her ive always been a greenie at heart and i live in the driest state of the driest continent and the drought just breathes down our neck all the time here and the murray is in critical trouble all those things weigh on your mind helly has to learn that you cant fight that sort of stuff parents do get sick dust storms do come
8765513 there are a lot of kids who do struggle and suffer
8765514 in my own life it was tough being a kid in a migrant family and tough never having enough money and a lot of kids face those difficulties
8765515 what matters is not that a knight in shining armour will come and save helly she comes to realise that she is the knight and she is the grail and thats the quest realised in the end she finds the stuff she thought was outside herself inside herself
8765516 my stomach ties up in knots wondering what the critics are going to say
8765517 they come from a series of works he created at the height of his
8765518 it keeps running through my mind august has come and almost gone schools
8765519 the democrats have just nominated someone for vice president whos basically saying hey vote for me because im a good commuter joe biden a good little commuter
8765520 read p n harrisons problem of the pastoral epistles he got it right
8765521 so and so has all sorts of numbers statistics math and tables that i dont fully understand so it must be right
8765522 i thought they would be a bunch of rednecks and they were
8765523 because there comes a point when you look in the mirror and it doesnt bear any resemblance to what youre feeling like
8765524 one is campaigning for what i really trust and believe in which is nonviolence and causes that ring true thats how ive judged it all my life
8765525 im not very comfortable breaking the pattern ive had for a lifetime but with him its more that i like the fact that he reminds me of what it was like 30 years ago with civil rights and that he can be and maybe is a statesman and that he is enormously bright and empathetic
8765526 yes i know i have been one and that to some people i still am
8765527 what i hope ive modelled is the need to find your place the need for people to do that when their hearts calling them
8765528 im getting to know my son and what he does and his wife and my grandchild
8765529 at the early age when i started i wasnt sure what i thought about music
8765530 i was rock solid clear in my politics of nonviolence i wasnt that clear about the music i knew where i liked to play but had no idea what the future would be i had no ambition things just came about so fast in such a lovely fashion that i just kind of rode along on it
8765531 for what we wanted and what we needed at the time
8765532 i did meet tom waits decades ago when he was much goofier than he is now
8765533 because its as close to the very beginning as ive come its like a bookend to 1959 for me
8765534 i dont have as much of an adventurous spirit as i used to
8765535 every time i leave home i go why the hell am i doing this then by the time i get to the end of a tour im wondering why we have to stop

8765539 the speech itself was like a piece of music and the words were words that you remember the rest of your life
8765540 what he was saying was so representative of what those of us who were working in the civil rights movement were experiencing every day
8765541 it would be a mistake i think for barack obama to avoid the claim that he stands in the shadows of a figure in washington who appealed to the conscience of a nation
8765542 oh no were not i put on the wife beater first
8765543 but its the only shirt that fits over my belly

8765553 she listens in a way i imagine a top notch therapist would not even perceptibly cringing when i say that eli parks his bike in the living room or that we need a place to store mustaches and wigs
8765554 when we get to the closet i make a confession something i have never told anyone
8765555 our shoes are in a wine rack i say it breathlessly confessing yes but also hoping shell ignore it
8765556 we keep most of our shoes in this wire wine rack thing that we got at a garage sale
8765557 oh she sounds amused and is that working for you
8765558 i think its because a shoe and a bottle of wine are not really the same shape
8765559 we make eye contact i see him spot our cruise to lose name tags and then he rushes up the stairs hes coming right for us thank god i pinned that thing on he bounds straight to jan wrapping his arms around her and plants a kiss on her cheek

8765572 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8765573 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8765574 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up
8765575 it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8765576 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8765577 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see
8765578 our jockeys put their lives on the line each time they race
8765579 they shouldnt also be expected to risk financial ruin each time they race
8765580 insurance is hard to get because theres a lot of falls and theres not enough jockeys to insure
8765581 its a small array of jockeys around australia and thats all they can get

8765584 the finding that metastatic disease can arise from untransformed mammary cells in the circulation refines our conception of cancer progression
8765585 learning more about the spread of cancer or metastasis is essential because its harder to treat the disease once it has spread
8765586 the over prescription of antipsychotics is a serious breach of human rights these drugs should only be a last resort
8765587 the forthcoming national dementia strategy is a crucial opportunity to stop this dangerous over prescribing and we look forward to its launch in the autumn
8765588 this study should remind us all that antipsychotics are powerful drugs which can both be essential for some people while carrying other risks
8765589 i dont think anybody wants to hear five minutes on energy policy said jennifer duffy who analyzes senate races for the cook political report a nonpartisan publication
8765590 the warfare began aug 7 when georgia launched a barrage targeting south ossetia
8765591 are going to be bored because im going to give some back story that you know better than i do
8765592 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together
8765593 they tried that in a number of countries they tried it in the baltic states but the fuses were defused nothing much happened they tried it in ukraine it has not happened yet but its getting hotter they tried it in moldova there it worked and now we have transnitria they tried it in armenia and azerbaijan and it went beyond their wildest dreams and we ended up with a massive massive war and they tried it in two territories in georgia which ill talk about in a minute they didnt try it in central asia because basically all the presidents of the newly independent countries were the former heads of the communist parties and they said were still following your line kremlin we havent changed very much
8765594 now the story starts really in 1992 when this fuse was lit in georgia
8765595 now theres two territories theres abkhazia which has clearly defined administrative borders and theres south ossetia that doesnt before the troubles started abkhazia was an extremely ethnically mixed area about 60 percent georgian 20 percent abkhaz and 20 percent assorted others greeks estonians armenians jews what have you in ossetia it was a completely integrated and completely mixed ossetian georgian population the ossetians and the georgians have never been apart in the sense that they were living in their own little villages and doing their own little things there has been inter marriage and a sense of common understanding going back to distant history the georgians will tell you about king tamar thats a woman but they called her a king and she was married to an ossetian so the fuse was lit and two wars start one in abkhazia and one in south ossetia
8765596 it was also lit in tbilisi there was a guy in charge here zviad gamsakhurdia a little bit like serbian nationalist war criminal in bosnia radovan karadzic he was a poet he was an intellectual but he was one of these guys who veered off into ethnic exclusivism he made stupid declarations like georgia is only for the georgians if youre running a multi ethnic country that is really not a clever thing to say the central control of the state was extremely weak the russians were trying to make things worse there was a civil war between georgians and tbilisi but the key thing is that here there were militias georgian militias and some of them pretty nasty
8765597 this guy zviad gamsakhurdia was driven from power from across the street they bombed this place
8765598 theres a horrible picture in my georgia book of this facade
8765599 of course he led the government in exile until he came back in 1993 then died obscurely in the mountains of suicide some people say others say cancer then he was buried in grozny
8765600 youve got two bits of abkhazia which are not ethnic abkhazia
8765601 the first thing that misha mikheil saakashvili did was try to poke his finger in russian president vladimir putins eyes as many times as possible
8765602 most notably by wanting to join nato the west in my view mishandled this situation america gave the wrong signals so did europe
8765603 but basically the encouragement was given despite stronger and stronger russian signals that a georgian accession to nato would not be tolerated
8765604 just a little bit of back story again in july of 2007 russia withdrew from the conventional forces treaty in europe
8765605 one provocation was to use the russian media to launch shrill accusations that the georgian army was in kodori preparing for an invasion of abkhazia now if you go up there i took a bunch of journalists up there a few times when you get to the actual checkpoint you have a wall of crumbling rock a wooden bridge another wall of crumbling rock a raging torrent and a steep mountainside filled with woods its not possible to invade out or invade in unless youve got air support which is why the abkhaz were never able to kick these georgians out they just kept that bit of territory
8765606 but this time im getting advice from an expert on how im doing
8765607 the next provocation on april 16 putin signs a presidential decree recognizing the documents of abkhazians and south ossetians in russia and vice versa
8765608 starting in mid july the russians launched the biggest military exercise in the north caucasus that theyve held since the chechnya war
8765609 on august 3 the head of the local administration says hes evacuating his civilians
8765610 on top of that for the last four years the russians have been dishing out passports to anyone who asks in those areas
8765611 so back to the 3rd of august kokoity announces women and children should leave as it later turned out he made all the civilians leave who were not fighting or did not have fighting capabilities on the same day irregulars ingush chechen ossetians and cossacks start coming in and spreading out into the countryside but dont do anything they just sit and wait on the 6th of august the shelling intensifies from ossetian positions and for the first time since the war finished in 1992 they are using 120mm guns
8765612 because of the peace agreement they had nobody was allowed to have guns bigger than 80mm okay so thats the formal start of the war it wasnt the attack on tskhinvali now stop me
8765613 all the reports ive read say saakashvili started the war
8765614 saakashvili is accused of starting this war on the 7th
8765615 but that sounds like complete bs to me if what you say is true
8765616 it must be stopped if not today then maybe tomorrow my troops were in our village avnevi on the 6th of august they blew up our troops four wheel drives our pickups they blew them up also in this village it was august 5th or 6th i cant remember they started bombing us with shells two soldiers died that day our peacekeepers the ossetians had a good position on the hill they could see all our positions and our villages and they started bombing they went to the top of the hill bombed us then went down we couldnt see who was shooting at us
8765617 but it started that day from that place when two georgians were killed
8765618 before they started bombing us they took all the civilians out of their villages
8765619 then they started damaging our villages houses a gas pipe roads yards they killed our animals they evacuated their villages then bombed our villages
8765620 but in another village i was fired upon on august 6th on the 5th of august they started shooting they blew up our peacekeeping trucks they put a bomb on the road and when they were driving they were blown up they also mined the roads used by civilians on the 6th of august they started bombing avnevi and at this time they took the civilians out of tskhinvali and sent them to north ossetia inside russia
8765621 they took the civilians kids women and put them on the bus and sent them to north ossetia
8765622 i was running away and the soldiers wounded me they robbed me and shot me in the leg with a kalashnikov i dont know if it was russians or ossetians they took my car took my gold chain and shot me
8765623 they didnt care if it was a house or a military camp
8765624 i saw it it was the russian military airplanes if they knew it was a georgian village they bombed all the houses many civilians were killed from this bombing
8765625 on the 6th while this is going on the integration minister who was until a few months ago an ngo guy and who believes in soft power things tried to go there and meet the separatist leadership
8765626 on the evening of the 7th the ossetians launch an all out barrage focused on georgian villages not on georgian positions
8765627 what they had in the area was peacekeeping stuff not stuff for fighting a war
8765628 the georgians will tell you that they estimate that these two actions together slowed the russian advance by 24 to 48 hours that is what the world considered to be mishas game and you know why the world considers it that because here in south ossetia was the head of the peacekeeping troops he hasnt been in iraq hes a peace keeper what have they been told for the last four years they lived in a failed state then there was the rose revolution it wasnt perfect but damn now theres electricity theres jobs roads have been fixed and what the georgians have had drummed into them is that georgia is now a constitutional state a state of law and order and everybody here knows that ossetia is a gangsters smugglers paradise the whole world knows it but here they know it particularly well the peacekeepers had a military objective and the first rule of warfare when youre talking to the media is not to reveal to your enemy what youre going to do so they werent going to blather into a microphone and say well actually im trying to go through tskhinvali in order to stop the russians so what did he say instead im here to restore constitutional order in south ossetia and thats it with that georgia lost the propaganda war and the world believes saakashvili started it and the rest of the story you know
8765629 this is your first time to the lands of the former soviet union
8765630 may sound just like a rhetorical flourish with no echo in the american mindset what it means in the post soviet mindset is what boris yeltsin was doing in chechnya this was the stupidest phrase this guy possibly could have used thats why people want to lynch him
8765631 your presentation was deliciously comprehensive perhaps it was well ask our new friend michael too much information out of the gate to absorb
8765632 there are some details that i would chip in who are the ossetians and where do they live this is the question that has been lost in all of the static from this story this autonomy south ossetia is an autonomous district as opposed to an autonomous republic with about 60 000 people max so where are the rest of the ossetians guess where they live tbilisi here there everywhere there are more ossetians take a look around this lobby you will find ossetians here of those ossetians who are theoretically citizens of the republic of georgia 60 000 live there and around 40 000 live here
8765633 are they on the side of those who live in south ossetia
8765634 one of them is georgias minister of defense correction georgias minister of defense is jewish not ossetian georgia is a multi ethnic republic and the whole point of the ossetian ethnic question is this south ossetia is part of georgia
8765635 everyone regardless of nationality even those who love georgia genuinely thought saakashvili started it
8765636 absolutely weve been trying to tell the world about this for months if you go back and look at the archives youll see plenty of calls from the georgian government saying theyre really worried even some russian commentators agree that this is exactly what happened dont forget they sent in a lot of irregulars chechens cossacks ossetians ingush basically thugs not normal chechens or ingush thugs thugs out for a holiday many western camera crews were robbed at gunpoint ten meters from russian tanks while russian commanders just stood there smoking their cigarettes while the irregulars that happened to a turkish tv crew theyre lucky to still be alive some of the georgians were picked up by the irregulars if they happened to be female they got raped if they happened to be male they got shot immediately sometimes tortured injured people we have in hospitals who managed to get out have had arms chopped off eyes gouged out and their tongues ripped out
8765637 you also have to remember the propaganda campaign that came out
8765638 human rights watch is accusing the russian authorities of being indirectly responsible for the massive ethnic cleansing of georgians that happened in south ossetia
8765639 that goes on a lot where i usually work in the middle east
8765640 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
8765641 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen

8765714 ah yes this kamei san was special to her huh
8765715 she was but you know i was glad that nee san was a little stronger this time not like when matsuura san
8765716 so am i strong for having stopped mourning like nee san and ishikawa san right now or am i just running away by doing so
8765717 youre still young and you werent as close to kamei san like the others id reckon
8765718 im going to have all of you organize the shed a bit
8765719 theres so much stuff in there though it took us a longass time to do it last year and god knows how much stuff youve collected since our last cleanup cant you just put your artifacts in there in the way weve organized it for you instead of just putting them in random places
8765720 well it gives you all something to do every spring
8765721 besides those two need to get over whats happened in the past you know
8765722 yuko seems to collect a lot of artifacts in her free time huh
8765723 if its that heavy you should have asked me to do it
8765724 you didnt have to act like a jerk about my helplessness alright
8765725 whos acting like the jerk i just told you to lay off the hard work and let me handle it that was me trying to be nice
8765726 you could at least do something about that childish attitude
8765727 i dont take kindly to insults that compare me to a brat
8765728 i think you may have hit miki with a black staff
8765729 i have no business to ill stay here and wait
8765730 i guess it was so hard on her to have such an unruly daughter
8765731 maybe it would have been better if miyabi was her only child
8765732 im nakazawa yuko would you like to stay with me for a while
8765733 why did you tell your aunt to shut up that was very disrespectful of you
8765734 dont disgrace the family any more than you are already driving your mother into suicide like that
8765735 its not my fault at all auntie should die for not telling the truth im not the one at fault here she is telling a lie i didnt kill mother she killed herself i had nothing to do with it
8765736 youre just a foolish child you didnt even cry when you were at her altar did you not cry because you were feeling guilty that you did feel partially responsible for forcing her into suicide
8765737 yusuke im going to watch miki for a while i trust that it will be to your benefit to have her not be in your sight
8765738 watch that demon all you want keep her if you really want to
8765739 theres no way in hell that im letting her be with that disgusting
8765740 but seriously i dont need a partner youre my partner in that snatching business you know i dont need a third
8765741 actually im thinking of retiring from putting myself into the crossfire
8765742 why youre great with projectiles i need a long range fighter as my partner
8765743 ill just pull the strings from now on i might participate in some missions but other than that ill be here from now but thats why you should look forward to your partner shes great with long range like i am
8765744 actually this girl is better than me so itll be beneficial for all of us
8765745 i am nakazawa yuko though formally fujimoto yuko since i am now adopted
8765746 nice to meet you i am matsuura aya please treat me well from now on
8765747 well you two can go free now i hired some people to cook dinner for us today since our dear chef cant with her hand like that
8765748 she must really enjoy cooking if she gets like that
8765749 well she really wont be happy once she finds out who i hired
8765750 when you talk about andrew symonds its like talking about bradman as a batsman or ponting as a batsman
8765751 hes in a place of his own hes that good an athlete in many ways like usain bolt
8765752 i think hes the best all around athlete for strength power and speed in cricket ive seen
8765753 ricky ponting is real good michael clarke is real good but none of those guys have the flat out brute athletic power and strength of symonds
8765754 in this incident the air traffic controllers on duty at the time have been stood down pending a full investigation
8765755 at the moment weve got most of the wreckage but there are a few bits that have been found in the vicinity where the aircraft collided
8765756 weve been working to do that we have a company which is training pilots now at mangalore and i know there are a number of other sites in the state which are under active investigation
8765757 moorabbins got a 20 year licence by the federal government and the next review comes up in 2009
8765758 as a matter of course we would make a submission to that wed want to look very closely at the coroners report and the casa report before we jump to any conclusions
8765759 that probably distills down to about 40 000 a month and thats a hell of a lot of aircraft flying circles around this community
8765760 ive been told about 70 per cent of movements at the airport involve international trainees theyre practising their skills over a heavily populated area and you might say a percentage of them are unskilled its a great concern
8765761 when youre talking about humans and mechanical contraptions theres got to be that potential for something to go wrong
8765762 moorabbin airport is the busiest airport in australia for aircraft movements
8765763 it deals mainly with old noisy light aircraft majority over 30 years old as opposed to general aviation traffic elsewhere
8765764 the majority of activity is light aircraft used by flying schools for daily repetitive circuit training
8765765 event after event of low flying planes crossing each others path within minutes and in some cases seconds of each other
8765766 i referred to the air traffic over our residential area as out of control months ago warning of an impending tragedy
8765767 the government has got to work out if its happy to have airports in suburban centres
8765768 as we reduce the size of our fleet and take other actions to enable united to compete in this environment of record fuel prices we must take the difficult but necessary steps to reduce the number of people we have to run our operation
8765769 as a destination which is now largely focussed on appealing to cultural seekers it is important that the people in the front line of delivering hospitality within abu dhabi have the relevant knowledge to enhance any visitor experience
8765770 this is the first in what we hope will be an ongoing program of imparting cultural understanding to the people who most interact with our valued visitors
8765771 it was very very interesting i have learned a great deal i can now pass on to our guests and also have a greater understanding of ramadan which will make me more tolerant the mosque tour was a highlight and something i would really recommend everyone to participate in
8765772 i think this emirate is seeped in culture and ramadan and its traditions is a period many visitors would like to explore more i will definitely be recommending they do so
8765773 the day was hugely informative the most interesting part was obviously the tour of the mosque which for me stands out as a prominent tourist attraction it is a must see for anyone coming to abu dhabi whether a professional within the hospitality and travel industry or a tourist
8765774 the mosque tour will appeal to everyone not just tourists and not only non muslims in fact i think it will have great appeal to muslims through its beauty and what it represents i will be recommending all our visitors in al ain to make the trip to abu dhabi if only to see this
8765775 there is something in this for everyone and i intend to now arrange trips down to abu dhabi for our own staff who will all be very interested in what there is to see and learn
8765776 i think we have demonstrated what can be achieved by pooling our combined expertise and resources
8765777 this could be just the start of a wide program which will ultimately benefit all within the destination residents hospitality staff and of course tourists
8765778 we do not anticipate any major reduction in the number of western tourists to russia due to the events in georgia similarly the troubles in chechnya did not seem to have much impact on travel to the country
8765779 the largest factors impacting on travel to russia are factors of the cost and ease of obtaining visas the cost of hotels and levels of service
8765780 it is too early to assume but i doubt it the conflict will stop ordinary tourists and businessmen coming to russia because russia has not created any restrictions for foreign nationals after the recent events
8765781 in fact most travellers to russia travelled in the days of the soviet union when relations with western europe were worse than they are today
8765782 producers for both shows arent taking any chances as far as conrads acting talents go as the 22 year old will be playing herself
8765783 think of it as an example a persons death counter is final
8765784 you could fly the speed of a jet how can you not be able to save her
8765785 you lead me on you lead me on into thinking we could have
8765786 they seem to act normal im too scared to ask if they got over it
8765787 ever since funeral two weeks ago i was worried that miki nee might be broken again
8765788 ah yes this kamei san was special to her huh

8765824 estoy devastada pero me consuela saber que pudimos disfrutar del m ximo rito de amor y compromiso antes de que ella falleciera
8765825 o filme n o descreve nem parodia nenhum desastre natural e sua data de estr ia n o de forma alguma uma refer ncia ou piada sobre o anivers rio do furac o katrina
8765826 trata se de uma coincid ncia infeliz no melhor dos casos e uma piada de mau gosto e imperdo vel no pior dos casos
8765827 seus filmes preferidos est o a ponto de serem destru dos
8765828 acabo de concordar em escrever um filme para a sony e a produtora scott rudin sobre como o facebook foi inventado
8765829 pensei que um bom primeiro passo em minha prepara o seria descobrir o que o facebook portanto criei esta p gina
8765830 vi que h muita gente por a utilizando meu nome em perfis do facebook o que me agrada mais do que me assusta mas quem escreve aqui sou eu
8765831 n o sei como posso provar mas sintam se livres para testar me
8765832 reci n ha sido admitido por malestar abdominal la investigaci n comenzar ma ana en la ma ana y no hay raz n para preocuparse
8765833 no podemos decirles en este momento por cuantos d as se mantendr en el hospital
8765834 el esta descansando y no ha recibido ninguna visita desde que lleg al hospital
8765835 su santidad esta con buena salud se acuesta temprano al anochecer y se levanta temprano en la ma ana
8765836 in any country today we have to look at the children
8765837 our daughter was a month old when we adopted her and it was just such a fun time and made us very close seeing what love and affection can do for little ones is really why i got so excited for hhi
8765838 some of the caregivers spoke swahili so the instructional posters really helped
8765839 so cute to watch and you could tell that she was enjoying the massage when i massaged her tummy and chest her arms would just fall out to her sides and she would relax
8765840 they were very excited and took some of the massage posters home to give to their own babies a massage
8765841 when i was in the slums i walked into the play area that had nothing but dirt that is where they eat congregate and do everything i looked for a place where i could lay a baby down for a massage and i couldnt find one at the minimum 2 babies shared one bed the conditions were so bad that i didnt think it would be healthy to do a massage there
8765842 the government doesnt run the orphanages in kenya although the are registered under the kenyan ministry of social services and some have department of social services representatives on their board they are run by nonprofit organizations meaning that hhi would need to find a way to connect with the organizations or the foundations but laura hhis executive director always finds a way i understand and believe that hhi is needed in kenya i think it would be an important part of the infant care especially for babies who have lost their parents to hiv aids
8765843 i love the program i think laura has gotten the most bang for her buck with what she has invested into hhi she is remarkable
8765844 try leaving cheese and a dead body out in the sun and youre in the same neighborhood as the smell of durian
8765845 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
8765846 va a mostrar sus razones para el cambio va a establecer sus apuestas sobre esta elecci n los riesgos de continuar por el camino por el que vamos que es sencillamente lo que el senador mccain est ofreciendo
8765847 now weve got something else starting up again a lot of people are nervous
8765848 im prepared you know ive learned some lessons and im prepared in regards to the wood im leaving as soon as we know it is coming
8765849 to allow implementation and more thorough testing of the replacement hardware that underpins the whole vehicles system
8765850 the agency will continue to rely on automated number plate recognition anpr technology to enforce compliance unless in the future the balance of cost and benefit changes as wider road and congestion charging are introduced
8765851 the challenges for us over the coming year are to refine and take full advantage of the new electronic services now becoming operational and to become more productive and cost effective
8765852 i think he has the desire to get there and i wouldnt back against him
8765853 he is as mentally tough as anyone he just knows his game knows himself knows what he needs to do with his preparation so well if he wants to achieve something he can almost get narrow minded about it not in an arrogant or disrespectful sense but he can focus in on it
8765854 thats what he does he tends to be able to realise if he focuses on his role thats going to be to the teams greatest benefit
8765855 obviously he is taking his time to get this injury right
8765856 i would say he is doing that because he sees he has a reasonable amount of time left in the game otherwise i dont think he would be investing all the time and effort into it to get it right
8765857 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8765858 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning
8765859 to move up the hearing date as evidence gathered from it could serve as a basis for a clemency application
8765860 constitutes a violation of hoods right to a fair trial and impartial judge and the allegations must be investigated
8765861 should preside over a fair process that would remove the cloud over hoods case instead of playing hot potato with this case
8765862 you waited two and one half months after receipt of the affidavit to file this petition
8765863 your petition cites no reason to shorten the 15 days notice requirement in reality you are exploring a civil lawsuit for the estate of m hood
8765864 to move up the hearing date as evidence gathered from it could serve as a basis for a clemency application
8765865 ive seen your videos and every single dance move you use you got off of me
8765866 a warm cuddly blanket that i love to snuggle up to and cover myself with
8765867 overnight longboards werent cool anymore dewey weber bing noll hobie all quit i had to adjust
8765868 in the 70s you couldnt even find a longboard blank
8765869 i am scheduled to be and planning to be at the state fair tomorrow morning
8765870 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
8765871 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
8765872 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
8765873 there are the hard core more conservative ones who will vote for him but hold their nose
8765874 candidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8765875 there are not many papers that go right to the core of some of the assumptions of democratic theory the way this one does
8765876 c andidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8765877 the difference between me and someone else is the difference between aristotle and demosthenes
8765878 it was not a step taken lightly or without full consideration of the consequences
8765879 russia had no option but to crush the attack to save lives this was not a war of our choice
8765880 we have no designs on georgian territory our troops entered georgia to destroy bases from which the attack was launched and then left we restored the peace but could not calm the fears and aspirations of the south ossetian and abkhazian peoples
8765881 in international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8765882 i sincerely hope that the georgian people to whom we feel historic friendship and sympathy will one day have leaders they deserve who care about their country and who develop mutually respectful relations with all the peoples in the caucasus russia is ready to support the achievement of such a goal
8765883 i am a fitness junkie who is looking for a new way to amp up my fitness workouts football manager 2007 best players
8765884 i am looking for new and fun ways to get and stay in shape
8765885 full of meaning and full of opportunity and if you as i believe and i know a lot of you do we did not lose the last election nor did al gore lose his last election we won it
8765886 ill screw around on my sick wife and make her lie in front of the cameras about it
8765887 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8765888 barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbit ran for president and he lost for this next election thats one arizona political tradition id like to see continue
8765889 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8765890 i will always call him governor bush because thats the last political office he was legitimately elected to
8765891 and it is now under investion they were fixed computors
8765892 there are too many republican robber barons in this nation and they exist and survive vy the use of the worst deceptive practices and tactics paying out to those whod sell their souls to put their republican puppet in the white house to enrich themselves and destroy america and its middle class and its working population these robber barons need to be crushed to a pulp to save america and its leadership in the world
8765893 fewer believe that those provided the margin of victory or that kerry was robbed of victory the way democrats think gore was robbed
8765894 no tiene la culpa el indio sino el que lo hace compadre
8765895 in a race almost as tight as hillary clinton and obamas run for the democratic nomination for president the poodle won by a dog hair with just a few hundred votes separating the top two contenders
8765896 poodles are currently the eighth most popular breed in the us according to 2007 akc registrations statistics and spent more than two decades in the top spot a true testament to their suitability as a family pet
8765897 it is crucial to see the womens rights movement in this context of creating more democratic equitable and just societies that benefit the population as a whole and i devoted my professional life to this cause
8765898 there are too many conclusions and views coming forth now
8765899 but we umno will conduct a detailed study to evaluate voter trends and the reasons behind their choice
8765900 islamic civilisations over time have also proved the wakafs capacity as a strong institution and an economic booster for a nation
8765901 their job was to zoom in on those accepting bribes from runners and syndicates
8765902 the majority of those caught were junior officers tempted to take large sums in bribes the senior officers would later take a cut for certifying the vehicles as roadworthy
8765903 officers who have an aversion to bribes succumbed to peer pressure this is because the corrupt ones need the assistance of everyone involved in inspecting the vehicles
8765904 this is why the officers had to work as a team to collect bribes
8765905 some of the certified vehicles were not even at puspakom centres for the checks
8765906 almost everyone will receive a cut this is why there are so many cars buses and lorries that are not roadworthy still on the road
8765907 he likes to feed squirrels but they had stopped coming since the developer cleared the hillside they cut down trees and even shot the monkeys living there
8765908 we will be renting a house a few doors away which is owned by our neighbour
8765909 its better this way be cause we need to move our things until everything is settled
8765910 when we protested city hall and developer told us that itll be safe now they want us to move out temporarily for our safety dna bill can only be referred to select committee after home minister has replied to points
8765911 they gave us reports from experts that it was safe for them to conduct work but i believe they didnt give us a complete report so this is their fault
8765912 it is a stage by stage procedure and we stopped the work after receiving reports from the department of irrigation and drainage and the minerals and geoscience department that the site was not suitable for development
8765913 we thought our entry would be set aside when the malaysian contingent delivered only a silver medal in beijing it was really a pleasant surprise to win the top prize as it is as good as the gold medal in this competition
8765914 we even chose the glittering gold letters to make our headline more attractive
8765915 hopefully we can deliver malaysias first gold when the time comes
8765916 their family members went to prepare the bail money and returned after lunch
8765917 when they reached the counter they were informed by a court staff that all court registrars and sessions court judges were not in as they were at the shah alam court complex for a meeting
8765918 if they have to wait till tomorrow friday they can only post bail on tuesday as an order to produce otp notice has to be signed first by the registrar before the sungai buloh prison authority brings them to court
8765919 in this case their families would only be able to get the otp signed by the registrar tomorrow friday and the accused will only be brought to court on tuesday
8765920 selva managed to get a court registrar to return to the klang court to handle the matter
8765921 we are now preparing a formal pledge which will be initialled by all sabah and sarawak barisan nasional mps
8765922 we hope to present it to the prime minister over the next few days
8765923 its a lie our stand is very firm very clear we are not commodities that can be easily bought or sold
8765924 the people had given their mandate to us to develop and make changes to the constituencies
8765925 however the money received by the district police officers was never spent for the programme although they claimed that they had organised the event
8765926 the live broadcast is strictly for question time and we cant change our policy for just one person
8765927 ive got a big season ahead with united and england and i want to be fit
8765928 ive felt the injury on and off for 16 months sometimes more sometimes less its something ive had to cope with
8765929 the staff and i have worked very hard so that im fit and when i play i dont miss out
8765930 theyve done a really good job i think weve got it under control
8765931 hopefully ill be back soon and fit for the remainder of the season im improving every day
8765932 i want to win i remember the last time we went there i only played half a team because we had a monday league game against newcastle
8765933 when i saw lazio celebrating at the end it was like they had won the world cup i was not too pleased i thought that will not happen again
8765934 well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it but we are expecting a very tough game
8765935 how are people surviving such a high cost of living in a supposedly low cost area and isnt the low cost of living the main reason people moved to the suburbs
8765936 mew choo represents the new generation in badminton after a long absence following the lack of women shuttlers of calibre
8765937 it was not an easy choice in picking the winner but she suited our selection criteria
8765938 this is the first time consumers are given an opportunity to provide their views before any tariffs are approved
8765939 this condition is probably a punishment for what he had done to her
8765940 the court does not have to punish him as god has already done so
8765941 next time dont fight with your neighbours and think carefully before behaving like that
8765942 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8765943 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8765944 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8765945 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8765946 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president when the average american family saw its income go up 7 500 instead of down 2 000 like it has under george bush
8765947 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8765948 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8765949 it is why i stand here tonight because for 232 at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8765950 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8765951 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8765952 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8765953 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8765954 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8765955 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8765956 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8765957 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8765958 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8765959 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8765960 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8765961 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8765962 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8765963 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8765964 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8765965 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8765966 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8765967 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8765968 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8765969 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8765970 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8765971 even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings
8765972 we arrived at 9am more than three hours before our flight and waited for 45 minutes then we were told that the flight had been delayed due to technical problems
8765973 we were told to check back and some people left the airport but we have been waiting here as we had nowhere to go and had limited currency weve just found out whats happened and my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand
8765974 the mistakes were made by syed mustaqim when retrieving the data it is not about the data
8765975 it cannot be inferred that the computer was not working properly or that the data was manipulated corrupted or overwritten as contended by the defence
8765976 even though the lac and the cell id were inversed the site location and the transaction remained the same and accurate
8765977 oranges were put in the apple column but they are still oranges
8765978 these witnesses did not even know azilah and the two other accused in this case so what possible reason would they have to fabricate evidence against them
8765979 the defence made this audacious submission to prove that azilah was on the road at the alleged time the defence submissions have more holes than swiss cheese
8765980 the developer has informed us that they will clean up the mess they have also asked permission to use the road one block away so they can speed up the cleaning
8765981 they will also build a u shaped drain from lorong setiapuspa 1 to setiapuspa 3 to help rainwater flow away
8765982 as we can see the damage is only outside the house and did not affect anything inside
8765983 but we want the residents to come back and stay here so well do our best the developer will bear all the costs of the repairs
8765984 i believe this whole issue is a misunderstanding and what i can say is the residents dont want development near their place
8765985 whichever inspection centre has a high traffic volume of vehicles staff from other centres will be deployed to that centre it is an open system which we have adopted for quite a while
8765986 some centres have more staff compared with others and the staff are rotated around based on the needs of the centres
8765987 this is very frustrating i was unable to make a trip scheduled in the afternoon
8765988 when operators put more buses on the road they have to incur additional operational costs such as wages
8765989 shuttle bus services by rapidkl will be provided from the puduraya bus terminal to the duta bus terminal and the bukit jalil sports complex with fares fixed at rm3
8765990 some corals around the island have been damaged due to careless snorkelling and by divers as well as litterbugs and the weather
8765991 the reef we hope can restore the damage and at the same time encourage new growth around the island not only for our tourism industry but also because it is part of our natural heritage
8765992 its also a great place for fish to aggregate which would be a plus point for divers
8765993 the 11 athletes have been training hard and i am sure they will do malaysia proud
8765994 the fiery spirit and drive to succeed in the countrys disabled athletes have never failed to amaze me i believe normal athletes should emulate this trait
8765995 we may go to coimbatore instead of hiring to capacity at mahindra city if the traffic situation does not improve
8765996 the cute little devils began sprouting bumps on their backs which later turned into wing like growths during a recent spell of hot weather in chinas sichuan province
8765997 there isnt a system of psychiatric facilities in this state
8765998 what concerns me is that with a new administration the tendency will be to study the problems
8765999 folks are going to be behind the eight ball and if thats the case well see a perpetuation of the situation
8766000 we walked out because the minister refused to respond so there was no point for us to stay and participate in the debate
8766001 we will engage civil society and professional bodies and be ready to face them again
8766002 they know bn is united and they will definitely lose if they call for a division of the house to vote
8766003 we have agreed to support the teams effort by providing them with the necessary equipment required for their adventure
8766004 the land here is low and frequently floods so a few land owners pitched in rm400 each to build the canal from the plantation to the nearby river but things became worse when the sand mining clogged up the canal
8766005 the db chaired by datuk g vijayanathan felt that the player went overboard when he slapped an umpire and then tried to hit him with a hockey stick that is why he was slapped with a lengthy ban
8766006 the agency has received an overwhelming response from the public
8766007 the state headquarters at wisma persekutuan have received information not only on the force but also other enforcement agencies involved in corruption
8766008 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8766009 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8766010 we were walking down one of the causeways when i heard the unmistakable sound of a gary glitter song
8766011 i heard the song at a display of easter island heads
8766012 id paid good money and i hated the fact that it would be going to pay that evil man royalties
8766013 we knew this would happen he had a problem and now he will have an operation and he will be out for 10 or 15 days its not a big problem but he had pain and it was difficult
8766014 the injury wasnt affected by the period of extra time
8766015 he was playing with pain before and he kept going because he knew he was going to see the surgeon its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8766016 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard
8766017 when you play these kind of games the other team is playing and training just thinking about this game but we have been bringing in players from things like the olympic games and now we can start working as a group
8766018 we are disappointed with the actions of the nsc who should have resolved the matter behind closed doors and not leak it to the media
8766019 we hope the nsc and the media will refrain from further comment on the issue or we will be obliged to take action against the parties concerned
8766020 our client has been placed under tremendous mental pressure and has had his reputation tarnished following repeated calls for comment by the media
8766021 the doctors said i have the early stages of pneumonia which a lot people probably have
8766022 i havent been well since beijing and its gotten a lot worse since coming home
8766023 wannabe boutiques opened and closed and seen our niche become more and more popular as it was embraced by pop culture but 18 events 16 magazine articles and 8 television features later and we are still here

8766025 tapi hilangnya dana ini tidak akan mengganggu proses kampanye sohe
8766026 theyve done it before so yeah weve got to go out and play well
8766027 were off a break were i guess under a bit of pressure and its up to these guys now
8766028 its up to us to put our hands up and perform well and basically if they play good cricket we have to match it
8766029 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8766030 in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8766031 i am learning the language but i have raised the white flag with english food i dont like it
8766032 i think i am the only teetotaller in the whole premier league my teammates were surprised when i refused a mouthful of beer they looked at me as if i was an extraterrestrial
8766033 the local girls are far uglier than the ones in belgrade our women are far prettier and they dont drink as much beer
8766034 working on the money to make liverpools finances more sound
8766035 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8766036 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8766037 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8766038 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8766039 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8766040 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8766041 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that here
8766042 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8766043 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8766044 on aug 11 i took stalins personal effects in a taxi to the state museum in tbilisi for safe keeping i called the taxi and paid for it myself these are things that you simply cannot replace
8766045 nothing was touched in the stalin museum even though it would have been quite possible to come in through the open windows
8766046 of course the russian soldiers were also here they wanted to visit the museum but we insisted that it was closed and we did not let them visit
8766047 of course we are proud of stalin he was a man of such talent and qualities we need leaders like stalin today he had authority
8766048 compare him with todays leaders like us president george w bush or georgian president mikheil saakashvili
8766049 why did the russians do this to gori it was here that stalin was born without him moscow could not have won the war
8766050 if a person works in a memorial museum and does not respect the person who is being remembered then they should not be working here
8766051 stalin was a great phenomenon he was born in that tiny hovel and then rose up he was a great strategist he won world war 2
8766052 i do not believe the lies about stalin leading the repression no one knows what the reality was
8766053 we just know one thing that without stalin the world would have been in the hands of hitler these are the facts
8766054 its a hit with teenagers and families the show appeals to all age groups
8766055 this time season 3 we introduced ada berani where we have guest celebrities daring the public to test their fear factor and endurance
8766056 azahari and amat complement each other very well although they were new to hosting they picked it up pretty fast they are full of mischief and jokes they are just being themselves in the show
8766057 we are this way even on an ordinary day out with friends
8766058 we are constantly poking fun at each other we didnt think it would pay off this well when the producer of bang bang boom called us to be the hosts
8766059 we made a great pair as contestants for explorace we took part for the fun of it because we really love doing crazy stuff and challenging ourselves
8766060 beside being a funny show that gets people laughing theres a moral value to bang bang boom as well
8766061 you just have to see who you are giving your keys to and if they are real car jockeys or not
8766062 when he finished his lunch and asked for his car his car was nowhere to be found so he learned a lesson not to be too trusting of anyone the show is really interesting as we get to see so many characters and how they handle a situation
8766063 but we are mindful that we dont go overboard in fooling people as there are some who cant take a prank and have gotten upset
8766064 i have known azahari since young as we were from the same neighbourhood we went to the same school and eventually applied to the same university
8766065 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8766066 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8766067 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8766068 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8766069 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8766070 i was busy with preparations for the wedding i remember waking up in the morning and thinking about my friends getting ready for the film festival i never expected to win and im grateful
8766071 it has been overwhelming for the whole family it was raining most of the time in lake como and i feared the weather would dampen the wedding alhamdulillah everything turned out well and im glad that my guests enjoyed their stay there
8766072 steven and i split the chores when i do the cooking steven does the laundry we are both adventurous in the kitchen we like to experiment with new recipes
8766073 steven is cool he wants me to be independent and allows me freedom when it comes to my career i guess hes accustomed to my working around the clock
8766074 with everything being so expensive these days we are not giving it serious thought yet i give my all where my career is concerned yes i am a workaholic and i guess that at the end of the day no one can fault me for not doing my work well
8766075 id love to invite everyone i know but my concern is that i wont be able to mingle with everybody at the party im also excited about the door gifts ive prepared for my guests it the gift is special
8766076 they were absolutely fantastic i was so proud of them
8766077 they did a few routines one saw them dress up as clowns and they also did a dance to a jive bunny medley the disney workers told us the average age of children taking part was 13 but ours was just six
8766078 we stayed for the whole weekend so the children could enjoy the park as well
8766079 this was the perfect end to a brilliant academic year for j 2k
8766080 we enjoyed auditioning for the britains got talent tv show and performed in 24 shows
8766081 they dont have anywhere to park other than in front of peoples houses so if this means that our front yard becomes a parking lot i would say i dont like that
8766082 local businesses we want to see them succeed but the residents in this area also dont want to sacrifice quality of life to see that happen
8766083 nato has not traditionally played a role in energy security matters it can however play a more active role defending energy infrastructure and the flow of oil and gas on the high seas nato might also provide security for infrastructure in energy producing states facing unrest
8766084 the difference between the american system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellants argument suggests
8766085 serious and lasting damage to the us uk intelligence sharing relationship
8766086 people have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8766087 picked up one of the city guide books put out by the san diego convention and visitors bureau there is a coupon in that book for the go san diego cards
8766088 we are going to have a team here next september
8766089 dont think the next player that has a pull or tear wont be reminded by his coaches that if shawne merriman is still
8766090 the mentality of letting go across the channel seems to be the same one that makes les anglais get drunk as soon as they leave their country
8766091 with barack obama bill and hillary clinton and even joe biden the democrats are streets ahead of the republicans in oratorical skill george bush dick cheney and john mccain are pathetic by comparison but it seems to be doubtful how much this matters
8766092 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8766093 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8766094 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8766095 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8766096 consumers need to know there is a way to get the jump at the pump
8766097 our team has been in the oil business for decades we know how the industry sets prices
8766098 for years we have provided a service to gasoline distributors and station operators that predicts wholesale gasoline price changes with amazing accuracy and we knew if we could predict wholesale prices we could extend our model to predict retail
8766099 shopping around to save 2 cents a gallon after the price has already moved up 10 cents is a real shame it doesnt have to be that way
8766100 we repeatedly told them that it was not safe to build houses on the hill but they ignored us
8766101 city hall said there was nothing to worry and they assured us our safety but what are they going to say now
8766102 they were right at 4am yesterday we received a call from a neighbour that there was another landslip thank god we werent home
8766103 early enough to minimise any under recovery of further cost inflation
8766104 with net debt now in excess of 1 8bn nervousness over gearing is unlikely to go away any time soon
8766105 our expectations for the year as a whole remain unchanged with progress weighted towards the second half as the benefit of all these fundamental actions begin to flow through
8766106 my father made strenuous efforts to raise the money but couldnt convince anyone
8766107 the result is that we found ourselves working with three sorts of stock eastman kodak ferrania and gevaert
8766108 when he was making the garden of the finzi continis he would often drive from ferrara to venice and spend all night at the roulette table then drive back to be on the set on time
8766109 they have been told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday
8766110 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8766111 they never say were going to cut off your oil because we dont like your foreign policy
8766112 there is a risk that they might do something like cutting oil to hurt the worlds democracies if they get angry enough
8766113 within a decade it will be very hard for russia to push us around
8766114 there is too much uncertainty about the long term structure of the tax regime and the fact that so many other companies are looking at a move is a more eloquent testament to that than anything i could ever say
8766115 all countries are effectively in a long term competition for corporate residence and tax is one of the key things that affects that
8766116 we want the flexibility to be able to structure ourselves for tax ireland has a taxation regime that will allow us to manage the taxation of overseas subsidiaries
8766117 im not counting down the seconds im counting down the seconds
8766118 mtv is proud to be teamed up with lifebeat again on this years vma weekend as we support their long standing commitment to hiv aids education and prevention
8766119 we have always seen the lifebeat benefit as one of the cornerstones of the weekend and this years event is no exception
8766120 by bringing rock band and lifebeat together we hope to unleash the power of one of the biggest video game launches this year to benefit a fantastic and worthy cause
8766121 hiv aids remains a major epidemic in america with over 56 000 new cases diagnosed each year and half of those infections occurring in americans under 25 making it more important than ever to reach young audiences
8766122 this annual event offers a great opportunity to further our goals and mission
8766123 to move up the hearing date as evidence gathered from it could serve as a basis for a clemency application
8766124 constitutes a violation of hoods right to a fair trial and impartial judge and the allegations must be investigated
8766125 should preside over a fair process that would remove the cloud over hoods case instead of playing hot potato with this case
8766126 you waited two and one half months after receipt of the affidavit to file this petition
8766127 your petition cites no reason to shorten the 15 days notice requirement in reality you are exploring a civil lawsuit for the estate of m hood
8766128 women will make a difference in this campaign we cannot and we will not take their votes for granted
8766129 we want to make sure every woman counts in this election year and every year thanks to the women here today who lifetime is proud to honor girls and women everywhere have roadmaps to follow and the confidence to blaze their own trail
8766130 there was always that there was notion that nobody was better than anyone else
8766131 everybody in pennsylvania knows that he is like one of the family i am really moved by the fact that he took his time with everyone he was incredibly gracious
8766132 the largest field operation in the history of american politics

8766140 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
8766141 hamlet 2 reuters fox news poll obama leads 42 to 39 going into convention buyer beware online degrees can come with pitfalls deannas tips for landing the new bachelor e online democrats try to flip the script on mccall
8766142 this is no ordinary time this is no ordinary election
8766143 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8766144 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8766145 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8766146 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8766147 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8766148 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8766149 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8766150 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8766151 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8766152 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8766153 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8766154 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8766155 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8766156 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8766157 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8766158 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8766159 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8766160 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8766161 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8766162 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8766163 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close

8766167 the opening marks yet another significant milestone in the overall effort to transform macao into an international leisure and business destination
8766168 the key to building a successful tourist destination is being able to assemble the critical mass of attractions needed to make the location more unique and compelling than its rival destinations that is why we continue to add more and more important components like luxury retail and world class entertainment to our cotai strip development

8766171 there are a number of significant events that will have an impact on our financial results for fiscal 2009
8766172 these include the financial effects of the bgs acquisition the timing of any sassa tender award and the development of certain international business prospects assuming that our current business activities will continue as usual and taking into account the significant contribution from our activities in ghana during fiscal 2008 we anticipate our fundamental earnings per share growth rate to exceed 15 for fiscal 2009 on a constant currency basis
8766173 we see the outcome as likely to be positive for bt and negative for vodafone
8766174 we fear there is a realistic chance that bovis will get perilously close over the next 12 months to breaching its interest cover covenant and or reaching its debt facility limit of 220m

8766177 calling the bottom of the market has been the most dangerous game around for nearly a year we can all see a huge amount of value in companies that have clearly been unfairly dragged down with the rest of the market but people are nervous it needs a good eye

8766182 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8766183 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8766184 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8766185 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8766186 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8766187 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8766188 these strategic investments pave the way for the future growth of the company especially in the rich games segment that was launched in 2008 on high end phones iphone n gage instinct etc and on downloading consoles wii xbox 360 and ps3 which is expected to fuel growth in the second half of 2008 and in following years

8766191 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8766192 even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings
8766193 we arrived at 9am more than three hours before our flight and waited for 45 minutes then we were told that the flight had been delayed due to technical problems
8766194 we were told to check back and some people left the airport but we have been waiting here as we had nowhere to go and had limited currency weve just found out whats happened and my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand

8766202 clinton is the first woman to run for this prestigious office
8766203 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it

8766205 for those of us who stood on the steps of the lincoln memorial or who in the years that followed may have lost hope this moment is a testament to the power and vision of martin luther king jr
8766206 it is a testament to the ability of a committed and determined people to make a difference in our society it is a testament to the promise of america
8766207 de un pobre hombre que no se mide para hablar
8766208 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8766209 why spend years holding difficult negotiations and looking for complicated compromises in ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the parties and push it to kill the other party and the job is done
8766210 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8766211 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8766212 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8766213 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8766214 what was that gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer
8766215 we have been looking for the holder of the passport but havent been able to find him we know that he is a resident in the state of texas
8766216 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity

8766237 i saw i think one or two guys up on the roof of the temple
8766238 i thought maybe they were taking wedding photos or something like that
8766239 at one point i saw him take his suit coat off so thats why i thought they were taking pictures because i thought maybe it was a tuxedo or something like that
8766240 its not an every day thing to see somebody on top of the temple
8766241 no not unless theres construction going on obviously thats normal but not in a time like this
8766242 certains hymens sont tr s lastiques et il est arriv que des femmes accouchent avec un hymen sain

8766247 venir a mi querida mar del plata con esta medalla es lo que sue o desde que ganamos la prueba con walter en pek n le debo todo al ciclismo que me ha hecho feliz
8766248 sometimes its not always safe to be on the road
8766249 theyre in a hurry to get to their own place
8766250 its usually better for the bicyclists to be in the lane of traffic
8766251 we consider it unwise to have a blanket rule to say never be on the sidewalk
8766252 pedestrians are kind of hard to tell where theyre gonna go doors opening it gets to hectic on sidewalks
8766253 the 5 oclock rush hour we get around here theyre pretty hectic especially around downtown broadway and the other main streets
8766254 so its easier for you at that time to be on the sidewalk
8766255 they would still need to yield to pedestrians on the sidewalk
8766256 it comes down to safety people who ride on sidewalks should be more cautious of the people around then but its the same as driving on the streets you have to be cautious about the cars
8766257 errores humanos afirm hoy el presidente de la divisi n mayor del f tbol colombiano dimayor ram n jesurum
8766258 con eduardo pimentel tratamos de fijar o renovar las bases y los criterios para hacer reclamaciones se le escuch y tuvo la oportunidad de expresar sus quejas y reclamos y aunque puede tener raz n en algunos de ellos no ha utilizado los canales apropiados ni ha tenido el mejor comportamiento para expresarlos
8766259 el record lo que ha venido diciendo a los medios de comunicaci n aunque no se niega que hubo errores arbitrales fueron errores humanos para los directivos del f tbol profesional el arbitraje en colombia es honesto y tiene una transparencia fundamental que ojal perdure
8766260 l ha anunciado que renuncia hoy lo ratific aunque esperemos a ver si se mantiene o cambia de decisi n
8766261 estamos por definir ambos encuentros que ser n un buen examen para nuestros jugadores
8766262 hemos sentido un gran respaldo de la federaci n venezolana de f tbol y creo que vamos por buen camino nuestra meta est cifrada en alcanzar la clasificaci n al mundial de nigeria en el sudamericano de chile

8766264 china va a ser un rival fuerte est en su casa y ya lo demostr en los ol mpicos no creo que los paral mpicos sean la excepci n
8766265 el grupo es bastante accesible nos toc estar con china holanda jap n y can da pero podemos alcanzar las semifinales y pelear por una presea el equipo tiene una mezcla bastante interesante de experiencia y juventud
8766266 el equipo tuvo una preparaci n de tres sesiones al d a las ltimas tres semanas fueron en horario nocturno para acoplarnos al tiempo de china adem s tuvimos dos eventos en can da y atlanta para llegar lo mejor preparadas a los juegos paral mpicos
8766267 vamos a ver qu pasa en el futuro porque vine a este pa s por mi larga amistad con el ingeniero bienvenido solano presidente de la federaci n dominicana de boxeo
8766268 rep blica dominicana tiene clase mundial lograr ubicarse entre los mejores con un boxeador con el coraje y la gallard a de f lix d az es realmente impresionante
8766269 the negative impacts of migration are not being considered because they are only economic benefits of the country
8766270 while the social impact of migrancy economic wise is good because it supports about 15 million families there are also other social impacts which maybe related to morality separation of the members of the family husbands separated from the wife and vice versa parents separated from their children and vice versa which have negative impacts on the families
8766271 i hope that our episcopal commission on migrants and itinerant people ecmi will be able to craft some suggestions for our government to legalize these migrants in the future thats the reason why they are talking now about the rights of the migrants for the families so they can migrate no longer as individuals but as families they will not be separated from each other
8766272 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especially at the ramadan time said quevedo who is the secretary general of the federation of asian bishops conferences
8766273 if there is a ceasefire the military would not attack if there is no declaration i just hope and pray that there is an informal ceasefire
8766274 your group were just assigned the task of designing a magazine that would be sent to overweight people about diabetes and how to avoid it you are the groups leader simple you
8766275 to empower others to become leaders by helping them lead themselves
8766276 the loose connector would have not been visible even if an inspector saw it the day before the fire
8766277 the loose connector would have not been visible even if an inspector saw it the day before the fire
8766278 he wanted to be in aspen and he thought the next generation should be here he think hes got a much better seat in front of the television but i am thrilled to be in the stadium
8766279 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged
8766280 you think you can hack my myspace page ive got too much money for that sh t
8766281 the events happened in new york and its a disadvantage to transfer everything here
8766282 i dont know how far ahead they planned that we obviously revealed our drum kit much earlier than they did
8766283 ive a feeling there was a oh s theres cymbals how can we put cymbals on our kit that would be the easiest way without having to rewire everything and re engineer the entire circuit board
8766284 ohh crap we need to copy that in our very next game
8766285 the owners of this site must be part of the crime family
8766286 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
8766287 acabo de concordar em escrever um filme para a sony e a produtora scott rudin sobre como o facebook foi inventado

8766289 vi que h muita gente por a utilizando meu nome em perfis do facebook o que me agrada mais do que me assusta mas quem escreve aqui sou eu
8766290 n o sei como posso provar mas sintam se livres para testar me
8766291 its to make things clear for the consumer so they dont get things mixed up like wheelchair curling vs olympic curling
8766292 es ist mir unbegreiflich wie man die pendlerpauschale berhaupt abschaffen konnte
8766293 i love guitar hero and i think its a part of pop culture i would love to do a guitar hero movie if activision would ever let me im trying to convince them but why would you have a movie screw up such a huge franchise not that i would make a bad movie so that would be cool to do a guitar hero movie
8766294 a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and the kid wins the guitar hero competition
8766295 there is a 50 percent increase in the price of salt
8766296 we are not real sure why there was such a big jump
8766297 since it is better to give than receive you do it voluntarily or we will take it from you
8766298 the loose connector would have not been visible even if an inspector saw it the day before the fire
8766299 eleanor roosevelt said do one thing every day that scares you
8766300 its my first time in denver and my first time at a convention
8766301 this might be the first black president in history this is history
8766302 it actually seemed like there was an actual chance to get something done
8766303 are not satisfied that this courts intervention by way of extraordinary writ is warranted at this time
8766304 at this stage we are continuing to monitor the situation and maintaining a watching vigil
8766305 i have cried and shed so many tears i dont know if i will have any left for today
8766306 we see ourselves in obama we see him as the carrier of all hopes and dreams not only our hopes but we seen in him the fulfillment of our dreams and desires of our ancestors when we see rise to this level then we see the value of blood spilled the value of lives lost the value of men and women slain slaughtered and lynched on trees throughout the entirety of our country
8766307 i am numb not in my wildest imagination did i ever dream that this would occur
8766308 we need to give obama the support he needs without waiting for him to help us
8766309 we supporters are full of emotion we never though wed get here so quickly i am quietly rejoiceful in a deep way
8766310 my dream is coming true i hope to remain upright throughout the speech in my seat the emotions i feel are exhilaration gratification and humility
8766311 we cant quit now we need to view todays event not as a culmination of a dream but as an important step along the way
8766312 around the world people are watching america to see how gracious she is with her democracy
8766313 there is talk about passing the baton from one generation to another the only baton were gonna pass is from george bush to
8766314 we came to denver saying yes we can now we leave denver saying now we must
8766315 the leadership we elect on nov 4 will determine whether there is chaos or community this has been a chilling experience we knew it would happen
8766316 for flexibility you are a savant for strength you are an idiot
8766317 after people were allowed to start moving back in the neighborhoods i used what i had learned organizing in politics to start organizing the people around me
8766318 you thought you were coming to hear me but im here to ask you questions
8766319 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8766320 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8766321 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8766322 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8766323 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8766324 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8766325 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8766326 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8766327 so the set reinforces that hes no ordinary politician but a celebrity instead and like most celebrities having delusions of being more than just an actor playing a part a singer entertaining a crowd
8766328 think of it this way the people having the most kids today are uneducated and poor so within a few years we will have a pretty dumb country
8766329 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8766330 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8766331 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8766332 i wish i had know this before we had three
8766333 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8766334 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8766335 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8766336 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8766337 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8766338 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8766339 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8766340 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8766341 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8766342 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8766343 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8766344 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8766345 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8766346 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8766347 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8766348 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8766349 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8766350 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8766351 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8766352 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8766353 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8766354 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training

8766359 following that election rockefeller got to know west virginia better and reached out even more to west virginians until being elected governor in 1976 and reelected in 1980 and entering the u s senate in 1984 once they get to know you
8766360 date code f 4 but made in 1956 57 made in the usa by gillette

8766364 this is not the vice presidential candidate i knew yesterday
8766365 i was born a poor black girl in the segregated south
8766366 uh mmm that what eh uh uh uh and what
8766367 for the first time in my adult life im proud of my country
8766368 forty five years ago dr martin luther king had a dream today i stand before you i am that dream
8766369 he wont be able to hide behind any fake greek columns or his wife
8766370 baracks candidacy would not have been conceivable 50 years ago
8766371 kings speech brought about a significant outpouring of support among whites for the idea of civil rights reform and even though obama wants to run as a transracial candidate his candidacy obviously has enormous symbolic significance
8766372 he has to present himself as the american candidate for president not the african american candidate
8766373 anybody who gives a speech on this kind of occasion speaks in kings shadow and is judged in comparison with him
8766374 thats part of the enormous challenge obama has created for himself for better or worse by happenstance or design he has set the rhetorical bar extraordinarily high
8766375 that speech was the first time many in our generation heard him speak in a coherent consistent way instead of the sound bites that wed been exposed to on the news
8766376 we were stunned nothing like that had ever been on television before
8766377 obama is probably the best political speaker weve had since ronald reagan
8766378 hes a highly rational speaker unlike king but at the same time touches people emotionally what gives him his emotional power is his use of the language of transformation obama is able to rise above the particulars of the moment and talk more in universals that can encompass people of many ideologies
8766379 in a sense he needs to do something similar to what king did
8766380 to do what only great orators can do offer a compelling vision of the future thats what great oratory is its not just putting words together its putting the right words to match the historical moment
8766381 dual core phenom based processors will finally see the light of day
8766382 ive seen your videos and every single dance move you use you got off of me

8766384 i understand why he has such a large security force he cant go any place by himself he just attracts far too much attention people love michael youre mobbed
8766385 he wrote a proclamation declaring saturday august 23 2008 michael king of pop jackson 50th birthday and thriller 25 celebration day it was a fantastic evening
8766386 michael jackson has inspired so many choreographers his music has been played and danced to in studios for decades michael jackson and dance go hand in hand
8766387 i am struck again and again by michael jacksons influence on dancers around the world so many of our applicants cite him as the reason they started dancing
8766388 the fact that his influence has lasted in this context as long as it has is truly extraordinary
8766389 nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise
8766390 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
8766391 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
8766392 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
8766393 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
8766394 when asked what americas greatest moral failing was theological obama said it was our collective failure to abide by that basic precept in the book of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me for obama the politician such scriptural quotations often serve as an all inclusive writ to impose his religious views on others when it comes to fighting poverty global warming racism etc but when the question turns to abortion political obama insists on a policy of moral agnosticism and political laissez faire
8766395 candidly talking about racial issues doesnt make you a racist any more than being aware of gender differences makes you a sexist
8766396 the overwhelming votes for obama in some virtually all white states show that many americans are ready to move beyond race but obama himself wants to have it both ways by attributing racist notions to the mccain camp that has never made race an issue the problem with clever people is that they dont know when to stop being clever and senator obama is a very clever man perhaps too clever by half as the british say
8766397 i could care less about the color of barack obamas skin but the thinness of it is starting to wear on me
8766398 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
8766399 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
8766400 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
8766401 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
8766402 michael jackson has inspired and transformed music over the last three decades his influence is evident in todays artists such as justin timberlake usher and chris brown from their music to their videos and choreography
8766403 ron alexenburg the president of epic cbs records knew when he signed the jackson 5 they were capable of a lot more than hit single after hit single
8766404 during the release of off the wall he was still supported primarily by african american audiences by the release of thriller he crossed over to a global audience and we got the covers of time and newsweek the same week he was the biggest star in the world
8766405 we threw a huge party at the museum of natural history celebrating his sales of 35 million which has never been eclipsed there is no one that could write sing and entertain the way michael did he is the greatest performer of our time
8766406 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8766407 michael has become so distant to so many people and he chose that path his family have been trying to get him to come back and get back in the game for years
8766408 hes a worrywart who just lives for his kids michael is worrying himself into the grave the family says that too i pray and hope that life begins at 50 for him because i want whats right for michael
8766409 spiritually hell be happy that hes turning 50 but age does bother michael because hes worried about his heart he doesnt want to do anything where hes gonna cause a heart attack
8766410 hes had a lot of stress that hes had to deal with of late if you look at michael you can see hes very drawn and this last trial zapped the life outta him thats why hes so fragile and frail looking hes just getting himself back in the swing of it but its gonna take a while
8766411 the family feels he should get out and have fun he needs to let his hair down he needs to celebrate and rejoice and live rather than constantly worry what people think about him hes got a bad habit with that
8766412 i dont even know if it really matters whether she wins or not
8766413 i write all the screenplays for my films the story outline was created by myself and a local collaborator named bob verigin bob has been part of my production team for three of my four feature length films
8766414 this film has taken 24 months but its not over yet the distribution phase which i am presently involved in will take up to an additional six months
8766415 i personally hand picked the entire cast of the film during pre production i spent approximately three months screen testing local actors it was a long and difficult process because sadly there is no active film industry here there in no infrastructure of talent you can call upon to find people to fit what i was looking for took a really long time because there really is no talent pool here but what locals lack in talent they make up with their enthusiasm and desire to work on movies
8766416 the costume weighed around 40 pounds total paul helped me with every aspect of the costume from designing an internal fan to keep me cool to bringing me water when i needed it and because of the bones on the costume to sitting down
8766417 i couldnt spend more than four hours in the costume unless it was really hot then it would drop to one hour or maybe two there was one weekend of shooting that i lost 12 pounds because of the heat it had been two days of shooting at 16 hours each day
8766418 neil knew exactly what he wanted from the character even to the point of spending time developing the walk of hadean sometimes a scene would have 30 different takes involving different angles to get exactly the interaction he wanted with the other cast members
8766419 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8766420 the next six months are going to tell the story
8766421 we are a beacon of hope for mental health similar to what the susan g
8766422 ayer la situaci n de la protesta fue muy ajustada pero el comit se decant por ellos as son las regatas hay que jugar fuerte a veces sales ganando a veces sales perdiendo hoy empezamos regular luego bamos solucionando sobre todo en el primer trav s incluso llegamos terceros con el matador pero no supimos izar la vela adecuada a tiempo se nos escaparon los l deres en la siguiente ce ida elegimos la derecha y la izquierda fue la favorecida y a partir de all no tuvimos muy buen d a no va a ser nuestro mejor trofeo pero quedan m s regatas y todos los puntos son buenos para recuperar no solamente en el trofeo regi n de murcia sino tambi n para el circuito el campeonato es un poco complicado pero tenemos que seguir dando el 100 concentrarnos a adido con un poco de suerte y saber solucionar todo
8766423 corrimos muy bien en las ce idas y popas thierry hizo una gran labor con la t ctica y la tripulaci n no dej de trabajar durante todo el d a millones de cambios de vela viradas y trasluchadas y sali todo bien
8766424 necesitas salir bien y un poco de suerte en las ce idas pero hoy la clave fueron los dos tramos al largo hab a que escoger la vela adecuada y que la tripulaci n trabajase al m ximo pues fueron dos tramos muy disputados y extremadamente dif ciles los errores de muchos barcos nos permitieron recuperar de esta manera
8766425 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8766426 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8766427 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8766428 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8766429 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8766430 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8766431 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8766432 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8766433 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8766434 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8766435 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8766436 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8766437 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8766438 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8766439 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8766440 bringing greater fairness predictability and efficiency to the civil justice system
8766441 places where judges systematically apply laws and court procedures in an unfair and unbalanced manner generally against defendants in civil lawsuits
8766442 particularly when you think you are a force for good in the state ever since we arrived there all weve tried to do is hire people pay people well donate money no good deed goes unpunished i suppose this is what we get back its a real negative feedback weve received and we take it seriously
8766443 that the plaintiff independently establish venue with respect to the out of state tortfeasor would effectively prevent joinder of the out of state tortfeasor this would be an absurd result contrary to all established procedure
8766444 i have a dream today a dream deeply rooted in the american dream
8766445 when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence
8766446 police in denver arrested an abc news producer today as he and a camera crew were attempting to take pictures on a public sidewalk of democratic senators and vip donors leaving a private meeting at the brown palace hotel
8766447 le prix des billets trop cher nest pas un argument valable la hausse du carburant est compens e par une diminution des prix sur dautres services
8766448 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8766449 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8766450 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8766451 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8766452 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8766453 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8766454 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8766455 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8766456 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8766457 it is a different kind of living you used to know everyone that has been lost
8766458 on sundays i used to love to go down to sturt reserve to hear the murray bridge band play with mr powell as the band master
8766459 my eldest great grand child is coming all the way from sydney to celebrate
8766460 it was such a surprise when i received a letter from them
8766461 i could not help but think how will i save my family
8766462 my wife heard a noise at the front door and i got up to check
8766463 as went to the back door i saw the offender who began hitting and kicking the window
8766464 he just kept on hitting the window with a broom and yelling that it was his house
8766465 i did not even see the knife in his hands
8766466 it was not until my daughter brianna yelled he has a knife that i knew this was going to be difficult
8766467 without jodies help i do not think i would still be alive
8766468 i thought we would be okay until the window shattered he just looked possessed
8766469 i can see a positive impact for the fact that they will receive a fairly large cash injection with the sale of their shares
8766470 to be successful the national foods proposal is subject to a number of conditions precedent including the support of more than 75 per cent of active members who vote
8766471 we dont even know 100 per cent that this deal will go through
8766472 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump
8766473 we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8766474 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8766475 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8766476 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8766477 i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8766478 its because of all of you that michelle and i have this great honor of helping to lead the party and win back this white house
8766479 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8766480 i never thought i would see a nomination speech live and then for it to be the first african american presidential nominee so yeah im just about to jump out of my skin
8766481 doing the speech at mile high is an important point for our campaign its symbolic of how sen obama won the nomination it will show how obama wants to involve people who are not usually involved in the political process
8766482 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8766483 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8766484 or will someone get up there and say fuck you i dont want to get down
8766485 i told them i didnt do festivals but the organization was going to pay me to do something i enjoyed doing
8766486 and its not coca cola or mobil oil there are far worse employers
8766487 you leave some things to chance as you go along and theres always got to be some possibility for failure and experimentation because otherwise youre just doing a job
8766488 the theme this year is about the american dream and this is about being american
8766489 its sort of like the ridiculousness of building a five story structure like knowing that driving a car kills the environment and still doing it its a ridiculous thing to climb up five stories tall and sit in a chair
8766490 parents do not have a constitutional right to home school their children
8766491 at times you get so over stimulated and agitated by these voice that you often flip out
8766492 if you are asked about this matter your message should be it is now under investigation
8766493 you have to remember that the sources are often other inmates and theyre not the most reliable sources in the world
8766494 you need to have fairly cogent evidence before you lock down an institution otherwise youd be locking it down consistently the issue here though is what was the information how cogent was it and what steps did the staff take
8766495 our government believes that the polar bear is an iconic symbol of canada
8766496 clearly we need to ensure that the polar bear does not become endangered or threatened in canada
8766497 we have a constitutional duty to work with a number of groups like the inuit on protecting the polar bear and we can also learn from traditional aboriginal and inuit knowledge
8766498 resulting low staff morale and high staff turnover make consistent and safe service provision even more difficult
8766499 we were delighted to run a successful show last year even without livestock and there is an even wider range of attractions at this years event however there is no doubt that the dairy competitions bring that extra edge to agriscot
8766500 unless shoppers are earning more than that extra theyre going to have to change their product selection
8766501 what some of our customers are telling us is that theyre interested in using collagen products instead of gut because of price the gut market is notoriously cyclical but once a manufacturer converts to collagen theyre likely to stay
8766502 its a momentous achievement we know it is the first premium drinks brand to reach this target it has been helped by growth in emerging markets like south africa and asia johnnie walkers formula one sponsorship has also helped
8766503 whether you agree with the social justice of this or not there is certainly a nucleus of consumers in the top 50 cities worldwide that have the means and desire to consume the best that is not going to change
8766504 there is always bedlam after a long advertisement period when the weather has interrupted work but we have already moved combines from areas where harvesting is up to date the benefit of the ring system is the flexibility it brings to a difficult season
8766505 livestock numbers are down and this is perhaps just a reflection of this trend in the short term before any significant volume of this years straw comes on the market but we are seeing a good demand for last years straw which has been stored under cover
8766506 fuel prices may have eased a little in recent weeks and i would like to see them fall still further
8766507 it took me an hour and 50 minutes to make it as far as the magnetometers but folks were surprisingly cheerful in the blazing sun
8766508 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8766509 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8766510 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8766511 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8766512 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8766513 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8766514 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8766515 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8766516 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8766517 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8766518 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8766519 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8766520 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8766521 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8766522 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8766523 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8766524 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8766525 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8766526 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8766527 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8766528 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8766529 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8766530 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8766531 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8766532 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8766533 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8766534 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8766535 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8766536 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8766537 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8766538 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8766539 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8766540 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8766541 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8766542 calypso you speak like a true mind numbed liberal i am going to address your point bullet by bullet
8766543 you talk of how the cia tortures prisoners and yet say nothing of how our people have been tortured and murdered i guess it is not ok to merely waterboard a terrorist who by the way is not subject to the protection of the geneva convention but it is ok to be beheaded by a rusty and dull sword
8766544 do our people get that and what about abu graib do you know what those photos look like saturday night and ted kennedys oh the poor terrorist had to wear panties on his head boo hoo
8766545 show me the proof of the thousands upon thousands of dead civilians that were murdered by saddam just because some code pink moonbat says it doesnt mean it is true please provide any credible report
8766546 an excess mortality of nearly 100 000 deaths was reported in iraq for the period march 2003 september 2004 attributed to the invasion of iraq
8766547 i take it then you were for the surpeme court decision to upholding the decision to negate the dc ban on handguns i mean hey they were protecting the second amendment
8766548 at this point in the war name me all the people affected by the patriot act that were unfairly targeted by the patriot act i bet if bill clinton had wanted the patriot act youd have loved it
8766549 and what is that other than the fact that you hate bush
8766550 force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention while material gain or maintaining economies is not
8766551 just war conduct should be governed by the principle of minimum force
8766552 were you for or against the war in kosovo and why
8766553 when did this happen i mean in the last ten years bush never did this
8766554 show us the proof why this was pure conjecture there is proof that the military votes were infringed according to the fec
8766555 was that bushs fault what did he do or not do what did the local people do or not do did you know that there was a plan to reinforce the levees and when it came time to do so the environmentalists filed a lawsuit against the army corp of engineers and won thus repventing any more work from happening did you know that instead of using the federal money they got to improve the bilge pumps new orleans officials built a casino the locals had ample changes to either help prevent problems or get people out and they did nothing and they are democrats one and all
8766556 ahhh the swift boat attacks oh boo hoo i have yet to see john kerry sue any of those men for slander or release his military records compared to some of the filth i have seen posted against bush i would say kerry had it easy he could dish it out but he couldnt take it please do find a single thing the swift boat veterans said that wasnt true and post back
8766557 who cares i do give a crap if he unites us or not i want him to follow and implements the republican platform i take it the messiah will unite us wioh that extremely liberal racord fat chance
8766558 what science global warming that isnt science they have proven nothing there is no proof just conjecture they used phony data and no scientific method to prove their claims just alot of bullying tactics alternative energy has been around for 30 years and is has gotten no where nuclear is alernative energy can we use that
8766559 so what he has kept us and you safe id rather have him than some phony who reads a teleprompter well but has no orgininal thought
8766560 i really believe in bsw and its ability to deal with significant common problems like food safety and their harmful bacteria identification capability i believe bsw s innovative products will aide in potentially protecting us from the affects of radiation poisoning from the affects of dirty bombs and from the affects of ultra violet a b amp c caused by the thinning of the ozone layer
8766561 bsw has an exciting future we want to be a part of it and we want to serve mankind

8766593 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8766594 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8766595 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8766596 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8766597 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8766598 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8766599 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8766600 the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided whenever possible
8766601 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8766602 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8766603 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8766604 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8766605 we have seen a small improvement in consumer confidence in august but this should not be seen as a turnaround in core sentiment
8766606 the improvement could be down to a number of recent factors which are mostly of short term influence
8766607 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8766608 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8766609 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8766610 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8766611 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8766612 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8766613 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8766614 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8766615 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8766616 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8766617 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8766618 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8766619 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8766620 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8766621 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8766622 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8766623 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8766624 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8766625 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8766626 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8766627 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8766628 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8766629 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8766630 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8766631 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8766632 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8766633 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8766634 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8766635 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8766636 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8766637 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8766638 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8766639 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8766640 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8766641 when tabcorp analysed the record dividends of 2007 08 on victorian racing we found it quite remarkable that that all three highest priced winners were from the bendigo region
8766642 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8766643 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8766644 bottom line im the general manager so if you want we can clear this out of the way this is not a joe girardi issue we have a terrific hitting coach i think in kevin long i think we have extremely talented players i put together a club that is where its at and im responsible for that
8766645 cut through all the red tape and stuff i think girardis done a tremendous job giving what has occurred
8766646 he continues to try to remain upbeat with this coaching staff to try to keep these players up and to try to perform up to their abilities
8766647 thats frustrating for all of us but the buck stops right here with me and id say it shouldnt go any farther than that my job is to put it together my job is to fix whats broken and my job is obviously frustrating the hell out of me right now to be honest because i just believe were better than this
8766648 throughout his campaign he has said that the thing that will determine his electability is his ability to make the case to the american people not whether or not theyre going to vote for an african american he believes thats true and it is true for him because he is a product of the dream of dr

8766650 she was taller than the other women currently seen in the pages of magazines infinitely more spirited and independent yet altogether feminine she appeared in a stiff shirtwaist her soft hair piled into a chignon topped by a big plumed hat her flowing skirt was hiked up in back with just a hint of a bustle she was poised and patrician though always well bred there often lurked a flash of mischief in her eyes
8766651 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming

8766654 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8766655 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8766656 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8766657 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8766658 eight years ago such a scenario would have been laughable obama was broke and without political friends of any consequence
8766659 raise taxes raise some more taxes and weaken the military
8766660 weve taken a unit of work and linked it all together
8766661 our aim is to make it make fun engaging and educational
8766662 my favourite experiment was the hovercraft where you use a balloon with a cd and they spin
8766663 our class has actually been doing science for some time
8766664 you have to sticky tape metal to metal and then the lights comes on like this
8766665 it really lets the kids construct their own understanding and age is no barrier to what they can do
8766666 its kids teaching kids and how to learn in kids language
8766667 mothers are the primary carers for small children in afghanistan
8766668 they are critical in securing better healthcare for children and particular attention should be paid to maternal autonomy at the household level for promotion of the health status of children in afghanistan
8766669 regarding child marriages not only the married child but also the children of child mothers are subject to a number of disadvantages the poor economic and educational status of these women and their overall immaturity caused by a lack of learning opportunities may have resulted in difficulties in preventing illness in their children
8766670 culturally appropriate programs that provide families and communities with education and reproductive health services can help stop child marriage
8766671 governments should play a role in this endeavour as well as strengthen efforts to meets the basic material needs of citizens
8766672 we have established that all types of antipsychotics carry an increased risk although the risk might be somewhat higher with the atypical drugs

8766676 this agreement will extend and enhance our already successful long standing collaboration with nikon and will allow us to provide even better products to our customers
8766677 this agreement is another great example of how industry leaders are coming together to collaborate through intellectual property licensing and by doing so enabling innovation that will ultimately benefit the consumer
8766678 we are proud of the quality of our broad global patent portfolio and we are pleased to be working with an industry leader such as nikon
8766679 we see this a lot with what some have called eye candy we get many requests to make the base user interface more fun with animations and graphics like those found on competing products while at the same time some say get rid of graphics and go back to windows 2000
8766680 the ability to have choice and control what goes on in your pc is of paramount importance to us and you will see us continue to focus on these attributes with windows 7
8766681 as a microsoft oem id love to segment functionality of vista because the machines i offer in the low end mainstream consumer segment may not have the cpu and gpu power to run vista correctly
8766682 i want to be sure that end user experience is the best and most appropriate for the performance of the machine
8766683 i think everyone wants a mac os experience or a vista premium experience the marketing works in the mac world because apple isnt selling us 399 499 mainstream machines with yesterdays cpu theyre selling us 1 000 state of art hardware
8766684 microsoft is caught trying to be all things to all people and as a result can never completely succeed at it
8766685 were kind of being attacked from a single competitor with a point of view that is more closed and offers much less choice that is much more narrow
8766686 and yet we have to tell our story and youll hear more about that versus where apple is coming from and amp well make sure that the windows pc doesnt just offer more choice but it offers every choice that you can get on a mac or other machine
8766687 byetta has been known to cause severe inflammation of the pancreas in addition to the deaths fda officials last week reported four other byetta patients were also hospitalized in october 2007 the fda also investigated 30 cases of pancreatitis in those using the drug
8766688 a spokeswoman with amylins public relations firm confirmed the four patients who died had taken byetta and had at least a mild case of pancreatitis but said other existing medical conditions may have played a role amylin and lilly officials maintain the drugs benefits outweigh the risks
8766689 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste

8766691 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8766692 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8766693 as far as girardi is concerned who i think is brilliant this is his first year and hes had to play the hand he was dealt
8766694 not only that he lost a lot of his parts through injuries baseball managers cant perform miracles its easier for a football coach to do that for a baseball manager its more leadership and having the parts having the players
8766695 the dodgers are in the easy division the national league west
8766696 if the dodgers were in the american league east they would be nowhere thats the bottom line but joe was a great manager and joe girardi is going to be a great manager we try to avoid picking bad managers torre was great and girardi is going to be great so no it wouldnt have made a difference
8766697 for now they are without josh beckett but they would have had to go longer without beckett or beckett and daisuke matsuzaka or beckett and jon lester to match what weve had with joba chamberlain and chien ming wang plus everybody else
8766698 the braves are so desperate for pitching that they signed elmer dessens off a mexican league team
8766699 there is a burglary in progress my husband is fighting with someone on the second floor 70 tonawanda street hurry
8766700 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8766701 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8766702 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8766703 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8766704 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8766705 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8766706 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8766707 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8766708 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8766709 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8766710 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8766711 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8766712 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8766713 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8766714 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8766715 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8766716 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8766717 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8766718 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
8766719 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8766720 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8766721 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8766722 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8766723 there was the ceremonial aspect of it that was very appealing i like the reverence you get from the priest being turned toward the altar instead of the people it adds a reverential feel you dont get with the regular mass

8766749 this is the first human study to show that the fat in obese people is sick meaning that it does not function as it should
8766750 the bad health effects associated with obesity are probably not caused by the extra fat itself
8766751 they probably result from the constant overloading of the system with excess calories
8766752 people have all kinds of theories about why bariatric surgery works the way it does but the most simple and straightforward explanation is that the dramatic and immediate reduction in caloric intake is responsible for this improvement
8766753 we know it exists but we dont have a good molecular explanation for it studies like this one provide important clues

8766818 this is the first human study to show that the fat in obese people is sick meaning that it does not function as it should
8766819 the bad health effects associated with obesity are probably not caused by the extra fat itself
8766820 they probably result from the constant overloading of the system with excess calories
8766821 people have all kinds of theories about why bariatric surgery works the way it does but the most simple and straightforward explanation is that the dramatic and immediate reduction in caloric intake is responsible for this improvement
8766822 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8766823 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8766824 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8766825 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline

8766844 the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patientswith dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and inthis patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoidedwhenever possible
8766845 we dont know why this extra risk associated withantipsychotics is even greater in people with dementia

8766867 per una settimana oltre alle centinaia dei delegati che giornalmente hanno preso parte direttamente ai lavori del convegno nazionale sulla liturgia grazie ai mezzi di comunicazione di massa siamo entrati nelle case di tanti non soltanto in italia ma anche allestero
8766868 sono davvero soddisfatto ha aggiunto perch attraverso questo convegno abbiamo dato sprazzi di luce che hanno illuminato i partecipanti sono inoltre davvero felice per come la citt ha accolto le diverse voci che si sono alternate in questi giorni a sviluppare i diversi temi
8766869 siamo pienamente soddisfatti afferma mons alfredo di stefano segretario del cal il bilancio di questa settimana liturgica stato senzaltro positivo il convegno a palermo ha assunto un significato molto importante anche per la sua identit che ha fatto emergere tutta la sua ricchezza e il senso dellappartenenza alla chiesa questa era la quinta volta che venivamo in sicilia e penso proprio che non sar lultima
8766870 la tentazione dei cristiani oggi forse quella di rifugiarsi in un rassicurante immaginario tradizionalistico ha detto col rischio fra laltro di consacrare lidentificazione fra esperienza cristiana e cultura tradizionale anche nella questione dellarte per la liturgia insomma si ritrova il problema della relazione fra cristianesimo e cultura

8766884 mothers are the primary carers for small children in afghanistan
8766885 they are critical in securing better healthcare for children and particular attention should be paid to maternal autonomy at the household level for promotion of the health status of children in afghanistan
8766886 regarding child marriages not only the married child but also the children of child mothers are subject to a number of disadvantages the poor economic and educational status of these women and their overall immaturity caused by a lack of learning opportunities may have resulted in difficulties in preventing illness in their children
8766887 culturally appropriate programs that provide families and communities with education and reproductive health services can help stop child marriage

8766904 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act
8766905 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army why spend years holding difficult negotiations and looking for complicated compromises in ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the parties and push it to kill the other party and the job is done
8766906 we dont want us ships to come here if it will start a war

8766945 just how much longer do you think environmentalists can strike deals that give up half of large wilderness ecosystems to industrial development for vague promises of protection simply more ecologically attuned folks know no more natural habitats can be lost and expect to survive climate hange
8766946 the only meaningful forest protection is to work to keep all ancient primary forests standing and to meet needs for forest products from secondary forests regenerating into old growth there is no chance of achieving global ecological sustainability until ecological destruction ends what remains is fully protected and restoration begins
8766947 you cant present yourselves as cutting edge selfless and knowledgeable forest protestors and be routinely cutting deals to turn over millions of acres of ancient forests to fatcat loggers and minders
8766948 giving up on half of canadas boreal forests for a pocket full is mumbles is not the role of the rainforest action network members or donors they have no authority or expertise to be pursuing such deals

8766963 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8766964 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8766965 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8766966 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8766967 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8766970 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8766971 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8766972 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8766973 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8766974 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8766975 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8766976 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8766977 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8766978 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8766979 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8766980 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8766981 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8766982 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8766983 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8766984 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8766985 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

8766990 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8766991 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8766992 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

8766995 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging

8767003 never in a million years would i propose a murder prosecution if i did not believe that there was more than enough evidence to convict george bush for murder and that i stand on firm legal ground
8767004 when we are talking about the crime of murder you have to realize that theres no difference between a former president and a regular citizen
8767005 to prosecute murder there has to be two elements the act and the accompanying criminal intent here the act is the invasion of iraq and that has to be accompanied by the requisite intent there is the express malice aforethought in that bush in invading iraq committed an act that he knew absolutely knew would result in the deaths of american soliders or it could be implied malice aforethought in that by invading iraq bush committed an inherently dangerous act with indifference to human life now with respect to malice aforethought that could be removed if bush could argue a legal justification for what he did and the legal justification that he would argue would be self defense the main legal issue at the trial would be whether bush took the nation to war in self defense the so called preemptive strike saying saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction and he was an imminent threat to our country and we had to strike first in self defense now if he could prove that he would not be guilty of murder but if the prosecutor could prove that bush did not take the nation to war in self defense but under false pretenses then all the killings of american soldiers in iraq would become unlawful killings and therefore murder
8767006 under section 1111 b of title 18 of the united states code the federal courts only have jurisdiction for crimes that happen within american territory so the defense argument would be that iraq is outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states and if the killings took place over there which they did on the battlefield the united states would not have jurisdiction but there is an exception to that known as the protective principle if an act takes place outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states but has an extremely deleterious effect on this country the federal courts do have jurisdiction and theres no question that 4 000 american soldiers dying over in iraq has a terrible effect on the united states
8767007 and just to show you how little effect there has to be look at the case of united states v benitez 741 f 2d 1312 1316 11th cir 1984 in benitez the defendant was prosecuted for conspiring in colombia to murder u s dea agents for assaulting them and also for robbing them now columbia is otherwise outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states and benitezs argument that the southern district court of florida had no jurisdiction was rejected by the court the court ruled that under the protective principle the crimes committed in colombia certainly had a potentially adverse affect on the security and governmental functions of the united states so if a case in colombia resulting in only an assault on federal dea agents and the robbery of their passports and dea credentials was held to have a potentially adverse effect on the united states as lawyers like to say a fortiori the protective principle applies all the more so in a case in which 4 000 soldiers have been killed in iraq in a war that has cost the nation more than 1 trillion this would certainly be deemed by any federal court to have had an extremely deleterious effect on this country additionally the jurisdictional basis for the prosecution of george w bush in federal court would be much more robust because no part of benitezs crimes were committed in the united states everything was committed in colombia with bush the conspiracy to commit the murders in iraq took place entirely in the united states
8767008 in old common law if two people agree to commit a crime that was a conspiracy
8767009 now federally we are only talking about one prosecutor the attorney general in washington d
8767010 with all those prosecutors out there and with all the evidence of guilt that i have gathered against bush i dont think it is unreasonable to believe that theres at least one prosecutor in the country maybe theres more who is sufficiently courageous to step forward and say hey this is the united states of america no man is above the law and im going to go after george bush
8767011 justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream

8767158 change is what occurs when you shift the components within a closed system nothing is fundamentally different the house still has all the same things it always had but the order the arrangment is different in a closed system the most exciting thing that can happen is change however the problem with change is that it is only a temporary diversion from the real problem which is that you are in a closed system transformation fundamentally alters your perception of the world and creates an entirely new set of possibilities for yourself and those around you
8767159 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older

8767163 this is the first human study to show that the fat in obese people is sick meaning that it does not function as it should
8767164 the bad health effects associated with obesity are probably not caused by the extra fat itself
8767165 they probably result from the constant overloading of the system with excess calories
8767166 people have all kinds of theories about why bariatric surgery works the way it does but the most simple and straightforward explanation is that the dramatic and immediate reduction in caloric intake is responsible for this improvement

8767220 preventing deforestation promoting afforestation reforestation and stopping peatland destruction are some of the cheapest and most effective ways of reducing global greenhouse gas ghg emissions
8767221 we propose the introduction of market mechanisms that can ensure investment is directed into these areas and a strategy to make this happen as quickly as possible
8767222 the prevention of deforestation and peatland destruction requires no technological development and little capital investment this method of reducing ghg emissions is dramatically cheaper than all other mitigation technologies currently available as low as us 0 1 per tonne of co2
8767223 the economics is startling if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on biofuel subsidies us 15 billion this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
8767224 one of the lowest hanging fruits of climate change mitigation
8767225 after these first couple of plants come online i believe we will be cash flow positive
8767226 in the case of geothermal the execution of that plan is all in our hands
8767227 the licensing side of our business requires convincing some other company to take the technology and deploy it into their marketplace and thats a lot harder to predict
8767228 geothermal usually takes much longer to be built weve tried to go with an off the shelf type of plant design
8767229 that allows us to exploit sites that frankly were passed over or thought to not be useful 25 or 30 years ago
8767230 we are going back through and tying up a lot of those opportunities
8767231 were seeing a lot of utilities recognize that geothermal is much more competitive than natural gas and has zero fuel risk exposure
8767232 the ultimate benefits of solid state will require software management and systems capabilities
8767233 ibm is integrating this technology with systems and applications so that companies can achieve real business value from solid state disk quicksilver is a significant step forward in this comprehensive systems strategy
8767234 this is not about replacing todays hard disk drive with a new form factor this is about having a complete end to end systems approach

8767283 she contacted the ird then tried to track us down which shows a lot of integrity it was a matter of luck really because it could have easily got into the wrong hands

8767339 the general population are starting to wake up to that fact that we as human beings have a responsibility not only to our own societies but also to the earth
8767340 the minneapolis institute of art put on the first and only exhibit of ghost dance shirts and dresses worn by men women and children
8767341 several native americans went to the exhibit elders as well as young people
8767342 i will never forget the night that an elderly ojibwa old man bill said to me there were only 14 of us when we went in to sit among the ghost dance shirts and dresses
8767343 another time a student of mine came to the exhibit she was crying by a ghost dance shirt i looked in the shirt to tell her its story because each one told a story the shirt wearers last name was there and it turned out to be the shirt of her grandfather there was no way she could have known that when she went in
8767344 because we are losing a lot of our relatives to cancer and alcohol and the earth is in dire need of healing
8767345 the pipe is a link between the earth and the sky
8767346 nothing is more sacred the pipe is our prayers in physical form smoke becomes our words it goes out touches everything and becomes a part of all there is the fire in the pipe is the same fire in the sun which is the source of life
8767347 all of our sioux ceremonies beseech to the four directions the earth and sky and ultimately the great spirit we see our creator through nature and we try to emulate what the creator has made this has worked out well as you can see from the track record of native american people the old time indians were honest ethical people and they had an unblemished environmental record when the pilgrims first landed they kept them alive and they took in black slaves they were extremely humanistic thats one of the main reasons that i believe in the natural way
8767348 oh great spirit i thank you for the six powers of the universe
8767349 most of us are not afraid of the great spirit we dont fear something that has given us our life
8767350 youve heard of the peace pipe there is no such thing in a sense because that came about when the government sent emissaries to the native americans at that time we were still the lords of the land we still held the power the u s government had to deal with that they understood that the pipe would allow peaceful transactions because no indian would ever lie once spoken on the pipe
8767351 when the europeans started to use tobacco they saw it as a market and thus corrupted its function now it is being misused and you see what happens when a gift that has been given is misused
8767352 when a stem and bowl are disconnected you have two sacred objects when a stem and bowl are connected you have a living being and the pipe is addressed as a living breathing being a catholic priest traveling down the mississippi observed men laying down their arms in conflict before the pipe they would not fight in its presence he said that by carrying the pipe you could pass from one end of this land to the other without being harmed a great holy man named lame deer said that as long as one indian holds the pipe and prays to the great mystery we will live thats how powerful it is
8767353 when you come out of a purification lodge you dont feel the same as when you come out of a sauna the ceremony is a rebirthing process theres something that happens in a spiritual sense that is powerful and uplifting
8767354 just think of this as a marriage ceremony that takes place within yourself the ceremonial leader is the medicine man he is a representative of the spirits who works within the invisible realm in order for you to become aware of the healing process within yourself
8767355 when you want to begin you find a medicine man and you offer a pouch of tobacco
8767356 at this point he will give you your responsibilities he will tell you how to set up the ceremony and what you need to do
8767357 then the medicine man will give you specific amounts and colors of what we call tobacco ties these are little pieces of cloth representing the six directions white being north yellow being south red being east black being west above being blue and the earth mother being green he may tell you that you need 75 yellow ties and 50 blue ones the colors represent who he is working with in the nonphysical world and the number of ties represent a specific amount of prayers that are requested by the spirits in order for them to come in and work with you you prepare a pouch with tobacco and you direct your prayers into each one before closing them with a tie your prayers carry the gift of your heart to the spirits so they know what youre looking for and they can see the sincerity of the heart thats where they look because they know the truth is there
8767358 the medicine man begins by setting up an alter usually the alter has some type of antler to hold his pipe then he sends up sacred herbs in the four directions there are four sacred herbs in the native culture one is sage which purifies a room of negative energies another is sweet grass a medicine man told me this is what brings in the heavy guys sweet grass brings in big powerful beings from the other side to heal you the third is cedar cedar is for purification it sets up an atmosphere for the spirits to work its a sweetness they like and its attractive to the energies of the invisible world the fourth is tobacco which has always been sacred to native culture it is used in ceremonies of smoking the pipe it is used to bless the earth whenever we harvest herbs or cut barks off of trees we always offer tobacco to the four directions and to the sky father and earth mother and we plant tobacco as an honoring of that plant tree or substance that is giving its life or part of its life to help our life
8767359 we honor our relations as we enter the womb and again as we leave
8767360 we crawl around until we form a circle around the center
8767361 when the water hits the rock it goes up in steam fills the air and unifies everyone within the womb
8767362 as we sit in the circle we each go around one at a time and we offer prayers of thanksgiving and praise for the almighty the great spirits the great mystery the sky father and the earth mother the medicine man sits by the entrance and is the first to offer his prayers each person then takes a turn eventually you come to the end and the medicine man blends all the prayers its kind of like weaving a tapestry its a mystical magical process an altered state that goes beyond the physical form it takes you into the reality of the nonphysical world where the real healing takes place
8767363 now we bring in the soup and foods and the gifts for the medicine man
8767364 it might be a blanket whatever your spirit leads you to bring the medicine man or to offer directly to the mystery
8767365 there are specific songs that are sung for bringing in spirits for talking to spirits for constantly giving praise and gratitude for constantly giving acknowledgment to the great mystery for all the gifts of life
8767366 we go around to each individual just like we did in the purification ceremony and we give prayers and thanks and ask for specific healing
8767367 amazing things happen i went for healing because i was struck by lightning while i was standing there all of a sudden this rattle came out of the air and started pounding me on the chest hitting me all over the chest and head then eagle feathers were all over my face there was stomping on the floor that sounded as if it came from beings 20 feet high and you could see lights and colors
8767368 the medicine man helps us remove the veils that prevent us from seeing life as it really is unified and sacred his approach is to help individuals resolve problems by the work they do themselves they prepare food make prayer ties sing chant and drum these remove blocks within the physical structure so that the person is receptive to impulses from the non physical world
8767369 look into a medicine mans background the way you would approach finding any new doctor find out the persons track record who are they what are their experiences and understand your responsibilities of going into the ceremonial process then the blessings received will be beyond your wildest imagination
8767370 when my wife found out that she had breast cancer and a doctor without any sensitivity told her that she needed to have her breasts cut off she immediately rejected this approach
8767371 my wife took chemotherapy at the end and it did prolong her life for a few months but she reacted horribly to the chemotherapy of course she would shes a native woman a natural woman putting something so unnatural into her body is going to cause her to react in that way
8767372 while taking chemotherapy my wife continued to attend our ceremonies where she would sit in the center surrounded by loved ones we would offer the pipe and use rattles and drums and sing for her trying to create peace and healing
8767373 she died just after mothers day i will never forget how she invited the children onto her bed and asked for the pipe the last act on this earth that she wanted to do was to smoke the pipe with her children even though the cancer destroyed her physical body the healing of her spirit allowed my wife to make a remarkable wondrous transition into the next world
8767374 its very important for people to realize that this is not fun and games going into the spiritual world is very serious if the intent isnt clear the spirits will not give the vision the most important thing is being clear in your heart as to what you are seeking for yourself and the people of the world
8767375 the first thing a person must do is to pray
8767376 there are certain items a person needs in order to present themselves to the medicine man properly
8767377 once you have your pipe you find a medicine man the person who is to be connected to you spiritually
8767378 after he accepts the pipe he will give you specific directions on what needs to be done
8767379 you also have to prepare tobacco ties on a continuous string using specific colors in a special order
8767380 you also need an eagle feather a peace of a conch shell that is cut in a specific fashion and a blanket
8767381 once you gather all these things that you will need you go back to the medicine man
8767382 when the stones are heated you go into the purification lodge
8767383 when you come out of the lodge you do not speak or look at people
8767384 once you are in the center he finishes the ties sets up your alter with the choke cherry branch and the red flannel the conch shell and the eagle feather
8767385 during this period of time you have no food or water you have nothing but your nakedness your blanket your pipe and your prayers youre down to the nitty gritty of who you are
8767386 at this time you will get direction in your life
8767387 you cannot go off the path at that point because you are now owned by the spirits
8767388 i sat there and i prayed all night and all day
8767389 once the helpers and the medicine man leave the hill they go back to where the sacred fire is burning and they pray for you continually
8767390 after you have been up there for a specific amount of time the medicine man and the helpers come for you
8767391 as they gather up the tobacco ties the prayer flags and the alter your head remains downcast and you continue to pray because you are still in ceremony
8767392 to conclude you participate in the wopela which is a way of saying thank you
8767393 for a period of time after that you begin to integrate all this wonderful knowledge that has been given to you this is a time to be prayerful to allow all the information to come in to integrate it in order to help you on your path this is also a time to readjust you are getting used to a whole different vibratory rate so to speak youve been in this spiritual way and all of a sudden youre coming back into the physical world the medicine man will talk with you and say as you come back into this world you will see hate and jealousy in peoples eyes and all sorts of things remember your commitment remember what you have done in your heart your mind can trick you into saying anything but your heart knows the truth you cannot lie when you go into your heart of hearts when youre in that center you will know what is truth you will look at these people and know that we are all pitiful creature just pray for them when somebody comes at you with anger hatred prejudice and all these things look at it and say that everything is in control of the spirits just as when you were in that center and nothing of a negative nature could hurt you you can enter that center again know that you are walking in a good way whatever the great spirit brings you is coming in a good way
8767394 one time i had a medicine person put me up on the hill
8767395 i went to the mountain and i parked my car down below
8767396 as each day goes by the phases of life go through their cycles
8767397 so this is a vision quest its performed by you and its for yourself you dont have to go through anybody you can communicate to the great spirit through observation of course its nice to have a medicine person there to help you interpret the experience when i came down from the mountain the medicine man asked me what did you see i said that i didnt see too much this eagle just came and hovered over me and lightning cracked close to me were you afraid he asked no i wasnt afraid in fact i laughed and i saw four horses before i went up the mountain but they were real live horses what color were they he wanted to know he was even interested in these pre vision quest scenes as well as my dreams
8767398 youre going to be alright but they sent me to take care of a man whos real bad off
8767399 son did you know that this whole world that we live in comes to a complete standstill for a short time just before morning thats the time when things like me can enter into this world
8767400 what do you mean where i was it was like springtime
8767401 something like that doesnt happen to you without your receiving a gift youve got a gift and you dont yet know what it is but some time soon youre going to find out whatever healed you is going to give you the power to heal other people
8767402 when water is thrown onto the rocks the heat does not merely cleanse us from the outside it also goes all the way into our hearts we know that we must suffer the ordeal of the heat in order to purify ourselves in that way we re emerge from the sweat lodge at the end of the ceremony as new men who have been shown the light of the wisdom of our spiritual heritage for the first time this allows us to participate in all of our daily tasks with the fresh remembrance of our position on earth and our continuous obligation to walk on this earth in accordance with the sacred ways
8767403 in 1990 the doctors told me that i had female cancer by the time it was diagnosed the doctors thought that it had spread and they scheduled me for surgery
8767404 i have a good friend named dorothy living at standing rock reservation she asked me if she could sponsor a sweat lodge ceremony for me and i said that she could so she had a sweat lodge ceremony and prayed for me
8767405 right after that there was to be a sun dance on the standing rock reservation
8767406 afterwards i went through the surgery and there were no problems at all absolutely none i really believe it was because i had gone to the sweat lodge and that i had gone to the sun dance where the sun dancers prayed with me
8767407 a year later i went back to the sun dance and did what we call a wopela a thanksgiving what i did was feed the people with traditional food
8767408 as soon as the cancer was diagnosed i contacted my family and they immediately went into ceremony all the time that she had cancer there were ceremonies for her at the same time there were prayers all around the world for my daughter i sincerely believe that my daughter was cured of that cancer because of prayer and medicine i sincerely believe in these ways i know they work
8767409 by the time i graduated from college i had already done my battles for the people
8767410 my godmother my uncle and some close friends attended the ceremony a pipe was filled with tobacco and offered to each direction as they called out my name they called it out to the east the south the west and the north they called it out to the sky and to the earth they called it out to the plants they called it out to the animals in other words i was introduced to the universe as white deer that was my rebirth in a sense i was a born again indian at that point
8767411 the name of course bestows certain powers and responsibilities the power of the deer is its awareness its keenness and its protective nature the white is purity purity of heart mind and words autumn i was told is a time when change is most visible its a time when change is at its most powerful and so i was named for that season
8767412 crazy horse passed on his name to his son who took the name worm as he got older so we can pass on names too the idea is that youre not stuck with the name you were given at birth in western society its almost as if you cant change you cant evolve you cant grow from a native perspective your name reflects who you are white deer of autumn reflects what ive done but as i go on in life i may want to let go of that and take another name i have that right so naming is the ability to evolve and change in your identity i think this is healing both physically and emotionally
8767413 sweet grass grows high in the rocky mountains and is known as the grass that never dies it is a gift from the creator and one of the great smells for reminding us of the mountains and the open air sage is the cleanest smell of the desert and is also given to us by the creator tobacco is yet another gift our thoughts and prayers are carried on its smoke it is a visual representation of our thoughts and prayers being carried more so because it carries the two great smells of the mountain and desert
8767414 western medicine primarily looks at physical causes and often does not consider the spiritual well being of the individual you have to understand that theres a big difference between healing and curing curing is a quick fix and will only be long term if the spiritual site is fixed
8767415 this is a ritual that we have for making a new relation
8767416 in this ceremony another family or group takes in a young person who has been left alone
8767417 in this ritual we use the pipe we use blankets and these days we use a chair they used to just sit people on sage and cover them with the blanket songs are sung an eagle feather is tied in the persons hair complete with a medicine wheel that could be made of rawhide and painted or made of porcupine quills thats done to symbolize their connection to the four directions and to the hoop of life hair represents the persons life because it grows it contains a persons wisdom and it contains their connection to the past
8767418 a person is taken in as a relative that relative system is as strong as blood it must be because the welfare of the group can sometimes hinge upon one individual and if that person is feeling disconnected he or she may fail you
8767419 in the old old days indians would always give things away
8767420 in modern times many indians live in houses and accumulate certain things they feel that they can give these things away when a person dies when you learn to live with less you dont have to worry about it you learn to be unburdened with all the excess trinkets that are totally irrelevant to living in this world
8767421 we talk about life giving rains coming out of the west we talk about clean waters and we ask how can we help make the water clean we talk about less wasting of water also we talk about fighting for the non pollution of water then we turned to the north and appreciate cleanliness and purity we know that we have an uphill battle as most environmentalists have but we beseech upon the north power to fortify us and give us great strength to endure in our venture into environmentalism we beseech the east power and talk about knowledge about educating children we see that more today kids are less apt to throw trash out of their cars windows i just had three occupants in my car one dumped his water out from his paper cut but he wouldnt think of throwing that paper cup out there on the grass had he thrown out the paper cup i would have stopped the car turned around admonished him and made him pick up the paper cup it doesnt sound like much but it all adds up so we talk about knowledge we go to the south power and we beseech for bounty to be taken away from these people that are wasting all business executives care about is making more and more money they dont care about taking their bounty and applying it to mother earths needs we beseech for the bounty to be distributed to people who will make use of it for the earth mother and for projects that will generate a myriad of environmental items that can cause less pollution
8767422 i think all people understand the power of things we understand that we as human beings are somewhat weak and so we need other things to help us
8767423 if i said to you does anyone ever make you angry you would say yes but in reality this is totally impossible you choose to be angry by the way you process the event this is something you were taught to do as a child if you could imagine not one person in all of new york city having the concept of anger thats what it was like during that time period of no wars before the white man came
8767424 whatever it was that healed him would become the power that he would use in healing other people for the remainder of his days
8767425 instead we will have a way of understanding each other just like the indians did for 150 to 200 years we will know how to take responsibility for whats happening to us instead of blaming it on outside circumstances
8767426 what would happen if you were to go into your mothers home walk across the living room floor and throw down a can of pop your mother would be all over you she would tell you to pick it up and take care of your home well its the same here
8767427 im also making a prayer for humankind and the land all around i make a prayer for all life i look at whats happening all over and i will notice that people are having a hard time in florida with floods and hurricanes i will make a prayer to help those people and animals and the land thats affected i will ask for pity from this place im not a rich man so i cant send a lot of money to help them but i can send a prayer
8767428 what makes the shamans role so fascinating in the late twentieth century is the cosmological setting in which a shaman functions namely shamans bring people into the presence of the spirit beings who are in the world and in the cosmos
8767429 we live in this world then where the cosmologies that are available to us provide no intimacy
8767430 we yearn for that in mainstream america we yearn for intimacies of exchanges with our world does that mean we become native americans thats a foolish thought it means we need to recover our own cosmology well what is our cosmology i think thats what we need to re explore we yearn to recover that shamanic presence that capacity to literally draw healing capacities from an exchange with the world around us to literally heal our communities environmental degradation is woven right into these questions were talking about one reason why native people are connected with this issue is that they have intimacies with their homeland they have regard for that mountain desert body of water when one reverences something quite often one doesnt trash it so these natural exchanges between a people and the life setting in which they find themselves those individuals called shamans i tend to see as a mode or way of being that all people are being called to recover we are being called to bring this sense of wonder back into our daily lives so the shamanic journey is not simply someone sitting with a drum or a group of people withdrawing and taking drugs in order to get into some altered state the shamanic personality is a challenge to the late twentieth century to recover right relationships with our bioregions to begin to understand the earth again as something that has always nourished us it will continue to provide for us but it also needs our care and concern that is the shamanic ritual now
8767431 the healing which incorporates native american and universal principles takes place in a sacred space
8767432 once that was removed his body naturally healed itself by reproducing cells that he needed to get rid of the disease and sure enough about two weeks later his cell count went from 4 to 300
8767433 so thats what i do i work as a guide and i work on a very deep level my aim is to release energy blockages so that a persons own energy can take over and restore balance
8767434 if a native american wants to be treated by ceremony i will set one up
8767435 i am a healer but the reality of healing is in gods hands im a conduit a hollow bone if you will for a patient to be healed he or she must be receptive to a higher power a person needs a relationship to god or a belief in a greater force
8767436 they have lost their spirituality and this is a good way to help them find it
8767437 everything said in the lodge remains there nothing is repeated outside of it this gives a person a real opportunity to cleanse the heart and to place things into the fire
8767438 there is stone medicine inyan medicine the sizzling and popping from the water on the stones actually gives a spirit direction theres wonderful healing in that
8767439 many vets tell me that they feel considerably better for some period of time after they leave the lodge
8767440 once they start to get their spirituality back their physical appearance changes they start to keep their hair they become neater in the way they dress their thought patterns become more cohesive without constant intrusions they can even think straight in many cases sometimes children tell me that their dads sleep for two days after a sweat lodge when they only slept two hours before so theres a wonderful release and a wonderful return of cohesiveness to their lives after the purification lodge
8767441 we have to embrace the total person the body the heart the mind and the spirit when any of these part are out of balance then there is a need for healing
8767442 and sometimes we need to heal our frustrations many times we need to heal the internal criticism that our brain is constantly carrying on which makes us feel less than but always we need to take a look at that which does not work in our lives and makes our behavior out of balance towards ourselves and others
8767443 in indigenous cultures when someone that we care about is dying there is a very intense need to mourn when you dont release the mourning it will make you sick certain anglo cultures have a different concept if you release the mourning you are looked at as if you lost control over your emotions the spirit of the person who has passed away that you cared about is not then free to move on into the spirit world because the mourning was not complete the people did not purge their bodies of this sense of grief
8767444 bitterness hatred and resentment are toxins from our heart while jealousy and greed poison our thoughts then we harm our bodies with unhealthy foods and artificial substances and hurt our spirits with a lack of gratitude
8767445 we have also done to the earth which is our sustenance
8767446 when we gather herbs to assist someone we thank each and every plant that the earth mother sends and we pass the first seven plants to always remember to leave enough for the next seven generations in doing that we are honoring the ninth clan mother who looks toward tomorrow for what our children and their children will need on the earth
8767447 humiliation is the one event in human life that becomes unforgettable
8767448 we can heal the need to experience this reflection if we protect ourselves the key is to notice that if we stop beating ourselves up internally the bullies of the world will quit picking on us externally in native american thought we understand that the external world and the things we experience in day to day life are mirror reflections that show us what we are doing to ourselves internally if we honor who we are without an arrogance or sense of pride but do it in a balanced way and we walk life in a manner that allows us to honor and respect every other living thing then we dont bring the experience into our lives that would necessitate us being shown how it feels to be bullied or humiliated by another human being
8767449 one of the things that human beings need to heal is the idea of hypocrisy we say walk your talk dont talk your walk human beings have learned over the years that spoken words are cheap and promises are often broken and that in many cases is a commitment that is not being honored so many times we ask people who have walked the crooked path to heal their personal integrity thats a facet of healing that most people do not look at in our grandparents and our great grandparents day a persons word was their bond but in this modern world most times if we give our word we arent sure that the person we give our word to and they give their word back is going to honor their personal integrity because the sense of self has been eroded to the place where we cannot embrace the idea that integrity is everything that if a person honors themselves that promise is made to themselves when you make a promise to another person you are making it to yourself thats another aspect of the great smoking mirror and when you do not honor your promises to another you have reflected back to yourself through that great smoking mirror what you actually think of yourself which must be very little because the integrity in your bond and your word was not honored by you so how can others honor that same thing
8767450 in traditional native american culture adolescent males and females are not allowed to be alone together a young man and young woman never see each other unless the young woman is chaperoned her aunts her sister her mother or someone else is always with her
8767451 parents come together at the right time of year when the moon is in correct part of the sky and plan a hoop dance
8767452 during this hoop dance the parents noticed one couple that did not change partners in fact they even heard some of the conversation the young lady was saying that she worked in her mothers fields during the day and the young man said that his uncle was teaching him to play the flute
8767453 the next day the young man went down to the field with his flute and played a song
8767454 listen to that sound blowing through the trees i wonder what it is but the young lady knew it was the young man playing the flute for her it made her so happy that her heart jumped
8767455 she wanted to send him a message so she went to a tree and asked the tree for a leaf
8767456 day after day the young man would go down to the stream and play his flute
8767457 then one day the young mans uncle came to him and said young man it is time that you stopped fooling around down by the stream and that you learned how to make a living
8767458 day after day the young lady would work in the fields of her mother and not hear the flute of the young man
8767459 after many months the young man came back very much a new person with new muscles and a joyful outlook on life
8767460 eventually he got around to asking the brother how is your sister
8767461 the young man took out his flute and played a song then something miraculous happened because you see love is strong and true love is ever lasting as that young flute player played his song all the leaves on all the trees began to fall
8767462 you know that i am telling you a true story and you can prove the truth of this story to yourself because around october and november if you were to go out you could look at the trees and you could see that when you look around all the leaves on all the trees start to fall this is because love is strong and powerful now you know why all the leaves fall off all the trees at that time of year
8767463 while the river moved over rounded stones and night hawk circles in the twilight the young mother whispered to the child who suckled at her breast you are the blessed that fell from the stars and took root in my heart little one you rested inside of my body and i carried you there for nine moons it gave me joy to carry the burden of such love i toiled for many hours to give you birth and finally the earth mothers magnitude threw you into your earth walk now that you are here i want you to know how my heart sings the love i bear your father is the stuff of dreams he has walked the path of strength and has been strong enough to share his dreams with me as well as his tears he has lent me his courage and i have respected him with all that i am together we have walked many trails and have faced each challenge heart to heart in you i see his courage his determination his laughing eyes and his curiosity in you i see my gentleness my compassion and my desire to live life with joy there is a love between your parents that fills each day with song i want you to remember always that you are and will forever be a product of that love
8767464 the little girl asked her wise grandfather why the great mystery gave eyes to two legged tribes of humans
8767465 your eyes can see the world around you and take in the beauty of creation
8767466 one day you will find a warrior to share your life with when that time comes you will be able to look into his eyes and see him with your heart through his eyes the opening of his orinda his spiritual essence you will know if his spirit can shelter you and if his heart is pure when you look into his eyes seek the truth of his nature if he looks away he is not strong enough to shelter your love for him if he looks directly into your eyes and allows your hearts to connect adding his strength to your own you will know that he is a courageous man worthy of sharing your earth walk
8767467 the woman scrubbed herself with sand at the rivers edge
8767468 in a heartbeat she was on her feet running through the water whisking the crying child from the stepmothers grasp
8767469 feather spat on the ground and used a hand signal to indicate that she was done with both of them forever and stormed off the woman stood in the water watching her retreat thinking of how much effort it must take to be that hurtful she turned back to the river and made the blessing sign with her hand showing her gratitude to the creator for her own medicine and her name offers kindness
8767470 michael jackson has inspired so many choreographers his music has been played and danced to in studios for decades michael jackson and dance go hand in hand
8767471 i am struck again and again by michael jacksons influence on dancers around the world so many of our applicants cite him as the reason they started dancing
8767472 michael jackson has inspired and transformed music over the last three decades his influence is evident in todays artists such as justin timberlake usher and chris brown from their music to their videos and choreography
8767473 ron alexenburg the president of epic cbs records knew when he signed the jackson 5 they were capable of a lot more than hit single after hit single
8767474 during the release of off the wall he was still supported primarily by african american audiences by the release of thriller he crossed over to a global audience and we got the covers of time and newsweek the same week he was the biggest star in the world
8767475 we need to boil that down we need to figure what changes have to be made to accommodate the concerns that are raised
8767476 theres been positive feedback but theres also been some adjustments that need to be made and we really need to sit down and talk about that and put our best foot forward
8767477 what are the adjustments that have to happen not to assume we got it all 100 per cent completely right
8767478 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8767479 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8767480 analysis of previous games and what similar sports and different things go for here
8767481 one was accessibility and the second was affordability and we want to grow the paralympic movement within canada
8767482 at times you get so over stimulated and agitated by these voice that you often flip out
8767483 when we adopted the surge we were losing the war in iraq and i stood up and said i would rather lose a campaign than lose a war
8767484 he and his news crew were standing on public sidewalks covering an event of public significance and performing a press function protected by the first amendment
8767485 arresting a reporter for simply doing his job is both unconstitutional and un american
8767486 that free speech is curtailed during the democratic national convention underscores the need for continued protection of civil liberties regardless of the party in power
8767487 the use of unnecessary force and the arrest of a journalist who was reporting an important political story
8767488 were committed to investigating any and all allegations of unnecessary force or complaints
8767489 weve tried to make presentations with a variety of money offers and term but we have been rejected at this point in time so theres nothing more
8767490 in the beginning it was a longer term deal that they were looking for i was led to believe
8767491 weve gone in that area but also weve given a lot of options in term with one two three and even five year offers thinking that one of the offers would be very very fair but to this point in time it hasnt really been discussed very much to this point theyve basically just said no
8767492 weve talked back and forth enough times with meszaros agents that we both know the importance for a young player to be in camp
8767493 meszaros is a good potentially good young defenceman i think he has had a bit of an off year weve put ourselves in a position where he can come here and with some help he can be a top top player but we need him to get to camp to help in that area and ive tried to get that message across but im disappointed to say we havent got there
8767494 fortunately we have a revolution its guaranteed that nobody will be forgotten
8767495 if lives are lost it wont be hundreds or thousands
8767496 the general secretary of the methodist church reverand tuikilakila waqairatu did not follow an important principle of democracy which is that the church members must have the opportunity to hear both sides of an issue before deciding to take positions
8767497 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8767498 unfortunately i will miss questions from fans because tomorrows mondays priority is the closing ceremonies and thats why i got the way early slot
8767499 anime pages are now up to access them just hover your mouse over news gt
8767500 michael has become so distant to so many people and he chose that path his family have been trying to get him to come back and get back in the game for years

8767503 hes had a lot of stress that hes had to deal with of late if you look at michael you can see hes very drawn and this last trial zapped the life outta him thats why hes so fragile and frail looking hes just getting himself back in the swing of it but its gonna take a while
8767504 introduction to digital media library players seminar at cedia expo 2008 frederic
8767505 im particularly pleased to see this artwork installed as ive lived in the gorbals all my life and its very close to my heart
8767506 is a man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8767507 when i first spoke out i clearly stated that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina
8767508 everything was arranged and agreed i have dozens of texts and recordings with dina to prove it but when the time came on sunday dina chose to go into nyc and have dinner with sam sams mother and lindsay rather than address real issues and make things better for lindsay
8767509 a day later dina told me that sam was writing a book that sam was a negative influence on lindsay and that sam needs to be out of lindsays life then she asked me how to do it
8767510 matters became worse when dina said lindsay was in real danger and she needed to save her and get lindsay into a place these are all dinas words tell me what father wouldnt be concerned and even pissed at sam after hearing this
8767511 to even imagine that dina would then go on vacation is even more sickening
8767512 dina cares please lindsay was once stalked by a guy name deleted who dina trusted and i said from the get go that i didnt only for dina to look the other way when i had to get a task force to track him down
8767513 dina took a percentage of lindsays money when i never took a red cent all the while i only speak out when something is wrong or needs to be made right
8767514 dina is a money loving fame seeking self serving deceiver who comes from roots of the same
8767515 while guilt may bring a response by some others like dina pass the buck and dont accept any responsibility at all
8767516 a mio parere la mclaren e chiaramente ancora il team piu forte
8767517 and thats the thing ya got the democrats goin with their first african american quarterback a strong ground game and a powerful headwind at their back against an old team led by a guy who remembers the t formation and boom it looks like the republicans are toast
8767518 michael de mare is to literature what jeffery dahmer is to fine dining
8767519 i think every american that i know was weeping over the next several weeks and devastated and shocked was that an act of pure terror it absolutely was and there are many other acts of terror carried out by our government even recently that that are comparable
8767520 these candidates are going to great lengths sometimes too great to differentiate themselves
8767521 theyre willing to gain an advantage by any means possible
8767522 were kind of back to our old normal dell where for 21 years in a row we outgrew the industry were feeling the love come back

8767533 we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8767534 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8767535 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8767536 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8767537 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet
8767538 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8767539 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8767540 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8767541 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country

8767551 it makes me more proud im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk but when its calvin klein and its steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
8767552 he said he didnt like her and wanted to kill her
8767553 he said he wanted to make it slow and painful
8767554 he said he was going to make it look like she moved out he looked at the ground and said he wanted to make her suffer
8767555 that woman rachael mullenix is the reason mr allen did this horrendous brutal act

8767569 en este momento estoy en medio de dos clubes el betis y el hamburgo ya estoy cansado de mal humor porque estoy hace muchos d as parado sin correr adem s ayer podr a haber estado en la cancha alentando sinti ndome parte del grupo
8767570 estoy m s caliente por no poder haber visto el partido de boca que por lo de mi pase
8767571 agreg el lateral refiri ndose a la consagraci n del xeneize en la recopa sudamericana ante arsenal
8767572 adem s en un mes voy a ser pap y estoy preocupado porque el pase no se define y yo quiero estar con mi familia
8767573 supuestamente se resuelve estoy pensando mucho en las cifras que se est n hablando me parece que mi pase decay mucho tanto para el club como por mi contrato lo del hamburgo estaba pr cticamente hecho hasta que rub n schwartz su representante me dijo que era mejor la opci n de espa a tanto por la cultura como por el idioma la diferencia entre un club y otro es grande pero no tanto
8767574 all three have done an excellent job they came forward with more information and recommendations
8767575 significant and perhaps major part in the uks energy mix over the next two decades
8767576 there will be environmental challenges but frankly its a political must to keep the lights on
8767577 to start from scratch to drive shafts would cost about 1bn and take eight or nine years even if you find the people who know how to drive shafts any more
8767578 this gave us a chance to get to know one another as people
8767579 i told him i dont think i can do this patrick said dont worry mom well take this one step at a time all of a sudden he was the daddy and i was the kid
8767580 it is still so beautiful i do concerts and have kids 10 or 12 years old coming up to me telling me that oklahoma is their favorite the music will be here long after were gone
8767581 the play began with a blackout and there was this blood curdling scream
8767582 the lights came up and there was this soldier covered in blood collapsing dead on the stage i just shot to the edge of my seat as an 11 year old
8767583 theres a little bit of the popular stuff like richard iii and hamlet
8767584 but theres a lot of speeches in there that people dont know so well on the whole but the narrative gives rise to them if i could put it that way and its very personal to me very idiosyncratic
8767585 set and lighting and the paraphernalia of a full production id often thought during that time that id like to have a much more portable easy show to travel and with shakespeare as my first love it seemed an obvious choice
8767586 it was a kind of quentin tarantino production extremely bloodthirsty and in your face
8767587 there are ghosts and murders and theres a great deal of bloodshed its everything that would appeal to a teenager
8767588 that particularly passionate language that caught me in the solar plexus
8767589 and ive changed my mind a lot as to how one makes these 400 year old masterpieces speak to a new audience and ive had a lot of adventures a great number of anecdotes arise and a few of them are in the show its not just to do with what shakespeare did in 1598 but its got travelers tales as well
8767590 in my working life theres been such a tremendous move toward realism and making sense of the lines rather than just indulging in the music of them
8767591 i sometimes wonder if thats a style well be laughing at 50 years from now just as we laugh at the style from 50 years ago we speak less poetically now shakespeares as carefully orchestrated as bach or mozart and you have to respect it but you want it to mean something and be clear and logical and argumentative and thats our preoccupation these days
8767592 its so hard you hear what he says and you want to believe it but how many times have we been disappointed before this
8767593 were here as veterans as soldiers as marines here to demand that the democratic party uphold to the front that they have as an antiwar party and actually make a stand and bring our soldiers home now
8767594 its so hard you hear what he says and you want to believe it but how many times have we been disappointed before this
8767595 were here as veterans as soldiers as marines here to demand that the democratic party uphold to the front that they have as an antiwar party and actually make a stand and bring our soldiers home now
8767596 its so hard you hear what he says and you want to believe it but how many times have we been disappointed before this
8767597 were here as veterans as soldiers as marines here to demand that the democratic party uphold to the front that they have as an antiwar party and actually make a stand and bring our soldiers home now
8767598 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8767599 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick at the time and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented to him
8767600 so do our troops hate the troops no of course not our troops love america and thats the point
8767601 gwen eaton is one of the most memorable characters oates has created to date
8767602 last time you see someone and you dont know it will be the last time and all that you know now if only youd known then but you didnt know and now its too late and you tell yourself
8767603 pawlenty said governor and legislators should look at state private partnership deals to raise revenue for highways as well as more use of state bonds and congestion pricing so that drivers would be charged for using roads at peak times
8767604 for the past eight years weve had two oilmen in the white house and where has it got us
8767605 some people tell us to drill here drill now and thats all
8767606 solar now wind here wind now and barack obama as a leader will invest in new ways
8767607 clinton called upon americas past humanity to lead us towards an interdependent global reality with reference to the follies of the current administration he places barack at the forefront of the movement to restore american global leadership
8767608 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8767609 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that sen mccain took office
8767610 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8767611 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8767612 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8767613 the over prescription of antipsychotics is a serious breach of human rights these drugs should only be a last resort
8767614 the forthcoming national dementia strategy is a crucial opportunity to stop this dangerous over prescribing and we look forward to its launch in the autumn
8767615 this study should remind us all that antipsychotics are powerful drugs which can both be essential for some people while carrying other risks
8767616 weve found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8767617 our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes
8767618 this means the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechano sensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper pre flight pose
8767619 but then weve always been slightly out on a limb
8767620 our first manager said he either saw mischief in my face or sadness
8767621 ive always had a sense of longing ive had moments of joy but theres a dissatisfaction on some deep level that ive lived with for most of my life
8767622 but the most surreal one was thom yorke when radiohead and rem played glastonbury i had thom in my spa pool with the rest of radiohead and rem sat around watching it was a strange day
8767623 people are starting to say we were ahead of our time
8767624 people expecting us to be walking around with poetry books under our arms and being intellectual are going to be disappointed
8767625 we were never trying to be clever different or weird thats just what we did
8767626 this new payzone system is just as quick and easy as any other payzone retail services which our customers in westmeath will be familiar with such as mobile top up paying utility bills and purchasing 3v vouchers with our national network of payzone agents ready to handle customer transactions m50 users will now have choices when paying their m50 toll whether they use the motorway once a day or once a year
8767627 russian brilliants have been the right choice for many people being hand cut faceted and polished like a natural diamond they do look natural but we have found some clients still crave natural diamonds to make this wish come true hadar through its sister company hadar diamonds is now offering an extraordinary opportunity to trade in russian brilliants diamond simulants for a natural diamond at a surprisingly low cost
8767628 hadar has a solution we can purchase your diamond too hadar also offers an easy pay repurchase plan
8767629 those movements carefully position the flys centre of mass relative to the jumping legs so that leg extension propels them away from the looming threat
8767630 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8767631 the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small changes in its posture to reach the correct pre flight stance
8767632 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8767633 el juicio ha concluido y por lo tanto se pueden efectuar los trabajos
8767634 just agreed to write a movie for sony about how facebook was invented
8767635 he had some clear ideas on how he wanted the products to look
8767636 incorporated in jersey and tax resident in the republic of ireland
8767637 notwithstanding recent suggestions concerning possible changes to uk tax laws the directors believe that the most appropriate structure is for the new parent company of henderson to be tax resident in the republic of ireland
8767638 contrary to popular belief oscar recognition is not necessarily a ticket to stardom
8767639 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful in the fight against poverty
8767640 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8767641 this is a pretty grim analysis coming from the world bank
8767642 although the overall number of people living under the poverty line has come down you still have a quarter of the developing world living on less than 2 a day
8767643 the urgency to act has never been greater the clock is ticking
8767644 especially in sub saharan africa where half the population of the continent lives in extreme poverty a figure that hasnt changed for over 25 years
8767645 food prices rise its analysts say ethiopia kenya somalia eritrea and djibouti remain extremely affected by poverty
8767646 if nothing is done the situation could easily become catastrophic
8767647 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
8767648 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8767649 all eyes will now turn to the special un event looking at the global poverty goals in new york next month
8767650 heads of state business leaders and others will need to do more than to deliver fine speeches and re commit to act on tackling poverty
8767651 as a company we do not have an official death watch anywhere
8767652 as an official position we support other manufacturers forays into new technology because it pushes the envelope and forces everyone to raise their game
8767653 if youre the biggest car company its probably more productive to try to show that leadership rather than worrying about or doubting some of the other innovative efforts
8767654 car manufacturers are finally paying attention to the fact that both presidential candidates are going to promote and incentivize plug in cars
8767655 every car maker wants to get in on this if its going to happy business models are changing
8767656 gm is upping the ante so this really is a race
8767657 if i had known it would take this long i would have looked for something else
8767658 back then there was this mentality to buy what you can and get into the market before they sold out
8767659 in pre sales clients were shown a hole in the ground and asked to buy a piece of air
8767660 the more pre sales you can bring to the table the more confident the bank will be that the project will succeed
8767661 ultimately people like to touch and feel what they are going to buy
8767662 the number of americans collecting unemployment benefits reached a five year high last week
8767663 the european economic community eec began for britain as a free trade agreement in 1972
8767664 milex 08 was based on the alisia scenario which is being used for eu exercises in the timeframe from 2007 to 2011
8767665 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8767666 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8767667 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8767668 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done

8767672 clinton called upon americas past humanity to lead us towards an interdependent global reality with reference to the follies of the current administration he places barack at the forefront of the movement to restore american global leadership
8767673 we need a president who understands the contributions of rural america

8767675 we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream
8767676 clinton called upon americas past humanity to lead us towards an interdependent global reality with reference to the follies of the current administration he places barack at the forefront of the movement to restore american global leadership
8767677 it is simply outrageous that this mountain of information was not better protected
8767678 we fear a substantial number of connecticut residents are among this latest group
8767679 what we are doing in the american west is previewing what barack obama is talking about in believing in change
8767680 the wide open west isnt just about wide open spaces
8767681 its about the possibilities of american opportunity its about binding people together with common goals shared visions and the pioneering spirit that defines all of america
8767682 clinton called upon americas past humanity to lead us towards an interdependent global reality with reference to the follies of the current administration he places barack at the forefront of the movement to restore american global leadership
8767683 if god doesnt live in colorado ill bet thats where he spends most of his time
8767684 clinton called upon americas past humanity to lead us towards an interdependent global reality with reference to the follies of the current administration he places barack at the forefront of the movement to restore american global leadership
8767685 we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like water
8767686 my friends during eight years of george w bush we havent seen much justice rolling out of washington
8767687 and we say today we will not be satisfied with four more years of the same with john mccain
8767688 to stop paying lip service to health care reform and just pass it
8767689 clinton called upon americas past humanity to lead us towards an interdependent global reality with reference to the follies of the current administration he places barack at the forefront of the movement to restore american global leadership
8767690 were going to spend every day looking for every opportunity to remind voters in the twin cities and across the country that a vote for john mccain is a vote for george w bush and his failed policies
8767691 a vote for george w bush and his failed policies
8767692 while we appreciate the efforts of these shareholders due to the dramatic
8767693 we are not seeking to renegotiate this transaction we are seeking to terminate it and obtain judicial confirmation that hexion has no obligation to pursue the acquisition or to pay huntsman a termination fee
8767694 they just listen to the critique and they go back and they work on it they dont get wrapped up in ego
8767695 we hope to help the lpga by offering a solution for their players
8767696 our offer would promote and support the communicative competence of its members and aid them in achieving the outcomes required to meet the lpgas new language standards
8767697 odd strange interesting and unbelievable things spilled on the road by trucks
8767698 this is an important milestone towards securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger
8767699 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
8767700 preventing deforestation promoting afforestation reforestation and stopping peatland destruction are some of the cheapest and most effective ways of reducing global greenhouse gas ghg emissions
8767701 we propose the introduction of market mechanisms that can ensure investment is directed into these areas and a strategy to make this happen as quickly as possible
8767702 the prevention of deforestation and peatland destruction requires no technological development and little capital investment this method of reducing ghg emissions is dramatically cheaper than all other mitigation technologies currently available as low as us 0 1 per tonne of co2
8767703 the economics is startling if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on biofuel subsidies us 15 billion this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
8767704 one of the lowest hanging fruits of climate change mitigation

8767706 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8767707 weve made ayp the last two years in a row
8767708 it means a lot for our school because it removes us from school improvement which is a plan the school puts you on if you dont make adequate yearly progress
8767709 its a very hard thing to do so i understand those other divisions that are struggling with different schools too
8767710 its a label no doubt about it but we are excited and its just a reward for the teachers who have worked so hard

8767750 the yoruba will remain in the mainstream of nigerias politics
8767751 the tribunal members used their powers to calculate the actual scores which showed that the pdp won the election fair and square let the opposition people come on board to move ekiti state forward
8767752 the process is still on we will uphold justice and the rule of law we will meet our members and counsel and in due course we will disclose the action we are going to take
8767753 the judgment confirmed that a lot went on in the tribunal than nigerians cared to admit
8767754 the governor was quoted a few days ago by the ekiti state television as saying that he would win by almost the same margin given in the judgment
8767755 the offences for which our clients extradition is sought were committed on british soil and we maintain that any prosecution of our client ought therefore to be carried out by the appropriate british authorities
8767756 our client faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8767757 our clients case highlights a worrying trend where uk citizens are at the mercy of the ever increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country
8767758 it is a shame that the court of human rights will allow his extradition even as they consider whether us extradition measures were fair
8767759 i have no fucking idea la what am i related to everybody from there

8767762 most of the world is bemused by western moralising on georgia
8767763 should support the underdog georgia against russia most support russia against the bullying west the gap between the western narrative and the rest of the world could not be clearer
8767764 concerned about the latest changes in south ossetia and abkhazia
8767765 this was a motion that arose spontaneously from the floor of the meeting because people are angry at the way the company has treated them both in terms of enterprise agreement negotiations and also the redundancy announcements
8767766 age staff are passionate about their masthead and their readers and are disappointed that the managers of the company appear willing to sacrifice quality journalism for the sake of the bottom line
8767767 one comment from the meeting was that journalists decisively felt they wanted to take a stand
8767768 well make the same demands we have from the beginning that the company negotiates with us on enterprise agreements and to have the guts to inform us properly about the cuts
8767769 the first is the ongoing collective agreement to discuss the failure of the company to make a decent offer on that
8767770 and secondly its driven by this really deep frustration at the failure of the company to clearly articulate the strategy it has to continue to produce quality newspapers magazines and websites with significantly fewer staff
8767771 e fumata nera mi dispiace molto per la gente che non vedra il calcio ma l accordo con la rai non c e mi sono anche preso l arbitrio di ridurre la richiesta della lega che era di 50 milioni senza coppa
8767772 everyone is focusing on japan as the big team in the group but i know uzbekistan from before when he was the south korea national coach they were the first team to qualify for this round so there is no reason to underestimate them
8767773 they play a russian style of football physically strong skilful with good organisation and the fans will be very fanatic
8767774 it is an interesting challenge it can help qualification if we can get a good result over there but it wont be easy
8767775 expansion of the a league is a critical issue to the continuing evolution and growth of football and this is a very exciting day for the ffa everyone involved in the a league gold coast united and north queensland

8767778 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
8767779 i think having the roll calls behind us i think everyones feeling much more pumped up
8767780 we have a real good shared sense of purpose to continue to roll with when we get home
8767781 i have no idea who the source is for this story but its absolute nonsense while i cant comment on this specific player since hes under contract to atlanta red bull and the league work absolutely in lockstep on player negotiations and the league has not blocked any move for anyone by the red bulls its difficult to respond to blog entries where unknown sources are referenced and of course blogs are driven by hits not necessarily by the same standards as print media

8767786 were seeing winter losses rising its no good blaming it all on the weather and its certainly not appropriate to blame it on bad beekeeping
8767787 theres something going on here in the hives that we dont understand and we should therefore research it really in the context of government expenditure the money were asking for is really small change we cannot afford to take these risks
8767788 by christmas there will be no english honey in the supermarkets im absolutely sure because were just not getting the honey in from the beekeepers
8767789 so we will have to import more in from abroad thats tragic imagine if that were a permanent scenario if there are no british honeybees therell be no british honey on the shelves

8767830 all that matters is that we are gamers and there are 30 000 of us here which makes it hard to believe that we are an antisocial group of maladjusted misfits so if you happen to come across someone who thinks we are invite them to play a game with you

8767872 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
8767873 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
8767874 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
8767875 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
8767876 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
8767877 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation

8767884 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
8767885 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
8767886 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
8767887 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
8767888 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
8767889 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
8767890 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
8767891 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there
8767892 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
8767893 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
8767894 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
8767895 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
8767896 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
8767897 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
8767898 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
8767899 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system

8767956 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
8767957 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
8767958 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
8767959 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
8767960 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
8767961 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
8767962 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
8767963 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
8767964 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches

8768204 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8768206 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8768207 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8768208 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8768209 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8768210 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8768211 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8768212 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8768213 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8768214 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8768215 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8768216 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
8768217 please say youve got extra tickets i can pay 75 00 for the first ticket i wish i could offer more but thats all i can offer monetarily but
8768218 obamas message of change the new generation the excitement he has been able to develop also needs to be balanced with the level of understanding and experience that joe biden brings to the table
8768219 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8768220 barrack obama will be the president of the united states and joe biden has 36 years of experience in the united states senate and has wisdom and experience and ideas and the balance between the two of them is an incredible one two punch to help this country move in a new direction
8768221 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit
8768222 you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
8768223 i think joe biden is uniquely qualified to help rebuild our economy and our damaged image around the world
8768224 hes been a champion for working class folk his whole life
8768225 i hate to be a cynic but it smacks of how do i get my tour opening night in the news during the democratic convention
8768226 if its against the law arrest me if you can handle it undress me
8768227 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refused to consider any smear or attack off limits
8768228 these comparisons are outrageous and offensive and have no place in the political process we hope that john mccain will offer a similar condemnation as his allies increasingly practice sleazy swift boat politics
8768229 better yet put me in office make me your vice president hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant
8768230 paint the white house black and im sure thats got em terrified mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed
8768231 yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped ball up all of his speeches and just throw em like candy wrap
8768232 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear
8768233 it would be nice if i could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying they were getting bad images of themselves
8768234 dit nooit meer ik sluit me nog liever de rest van mijn leven op in mijn ranch dan dit nog eens te moeten meemaken
8768235 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week
8768236 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and every thing i own is under water
8768237 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8768238 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8768239 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8768240 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be
8768241 eleanor roosevelt said do one thing every day that scares you
8768242 its my first time in denver and my first time at a convention
8768243 this might be the first black president in history this is history
8768244 it actually seemed like there was an actual chance to get something done
8768245 an end time army has one common purpose to aggressively take ground for the kingdom of god under the authority of jesus christ the dread champion
8768246 the trumpet is sounding calling on fire revolutionary believers to enlist in joels army many are now ready to be mobilized to establish and advance gods kingdom on earth
8768247 the pitch and intensity of the military rhetoric of this branch of the global dominionist movement has substantially increased since the beginning of 2008
8768248 one can only wonder how long before this transforms into real warfare with actual warriors
8768249 get busy in constructing a bible based social political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of god
8768250 such leaders prefer more authoritarian structures where their own word or decrees are unchallenged
8768251 everyone born after abortions legalization can consider their birth a personal invitation to take part in this great army
8768252 as the church begins to take on this resolve they joels army churches will start to be thought of more as military bases and they will begin to take on the characteristics of military bases for training equipping and deploying effective spiritual forces
8768253 in time the church will actually be organized more as a military force with an army navy air force etc
8768254 some pastors and leaders who continue to resist this tide of unity will be removed from their place some will become so hardened they will become opposers and resist god to the end
8768255 i am thinking god why is the power of god not moving and he said it is because you havent kicked that women in the face and there was like this older lady worshipping right in front of the platform and the holy spirit spoke to me and the gift of faith came on me he said kick her in the face with your biker boot i inched closer and i went like this makes kicking motion bam and just as my boot made contact with her nose she fell under the power of god
8768256 i believe were headed to an elijah jezebel showdown on the earth not just in america but all over the globe and the main warriors will be the prophets of baal versus the prophets of god and there will be no middle ground
8768257 theres an elijah generation thats going to be the forerunners for the coming of jesus a generation marked not by their niceness but by the intensity of their passion
8768258 the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force such force demands an equal response and jesus is going to make war on everything that hinders love with his eyes blazing fire
8768259 a lot of people die for god and theyre not afraid
8768260 like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come
8768261 it is a complete misinterpretation of scripture to find in joels army of locusts a militant victorious force attacking society and a non cooperating church to prepare the earth for christs millennial reign
8768262 through cain came all the smart educated people down to the antediluvian flood the intellectuals bible colleges
8768263 they know all their creeds but know nothing about god
8768264 a super race mentality toward the training of their children
8768265 today you can type joels army into a search engine and a thousand heresy hunter websites pop up decrying the very mention of it
8768266 this battle is not a game they joels army warriors will not be on the defense they will be on the offense and the gates of hell will not be able to hold up against them
8768267 our driving force and inspiration in these improvements is making the experience more convenient efficient and pleasurable for the 6 million people who park in our lots annually
8768268 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
8768269 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
8768270 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
8768271 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8768272 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
8768273 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
8768274 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
8768275 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8768276 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8768277 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8768278 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8768279 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8768280 ive never been to a convention before and this is awesome
8768281 he could probably play a 48 minute game and play the 48th minute stronger than the first minute of the game
8768282 we were looking forward to the trip to cancun but with the severe weather in the area we decided it best to keep our team and student athletes out of potential harms way
8768283 we are disappointed but it is the right thing to do and we were able to get a few great days of practice in and get the freshmen on the court for one day as well were all really looking forward for the 2008 09 season and will get a chance to travel internationally before next year begins
8768284 ahora que tenemos nosotros la sider rgica por qu nosotros no pudi ramos montar en la comunidad una unidad de producci n de materiales de construcci n la comunidad recibe un cr dito o una subvenci n y tiene una parte de la propiedad
8768285 cada vez me parece m s inviable la permanencia de ch vez en el poder pero no tengo idea de c mo se va a ir del poder
8768286 tengo que reconocer que has tenido raz n en todo cuanto has dicho en las ltimas semanas esta oposici n no puede sacar a ch vez por eso la salida no es electoral
8768287 y si no es electoral pues c mo va a ser la salida
8768288 es lo que no s y eso es grave porque la democracia es certeza y lo peor es que aunque parezca dif cil imaginarlo todav a pueden suceder cosas peores que ch vez y a todo esto se llega porque si tienes un gobierno que destroza al pa s y avanza menoscabando las libertades p blicas y del otro lado una oposici n que no enamora y que es torpe y sin ideas el c rculo est cerrado y la inercia que mantiene al gobierno es de poca duraci n es decir puede pasar cualquier cosa
8768289 leer un libro es ir para atr s y no para adelante
8768290 a million to one would be on the low end
8768291 a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and to restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world
8768292 theres no need for an ambulance just take her straight to the morgue
8768293 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8768294 lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8768295 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8768296 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8768297 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8768298 a continua o do conservadorismo nos gastos com tecnologia nos estados unidos o que tem se espalhado para a europa ocidental e v rios pa ses da sia
8768299 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8768300 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8768301 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8768302 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8768303 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8768304 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8768305 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo
8768306 cesen los allanamientos y la militarizaci n de las comunidades mapuche
8768307 los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche
8768308 el ministerio del interior presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8768309 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8768310 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8768311 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
8768312 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
8768313 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
8768314 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8768315 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8768316 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
8768317 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
8768318 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
8768319 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8768320 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
8768321 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
8768322 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
8768323 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
8768324 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8768325 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8768326 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8768327 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8768328 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8768329 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8768330 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8768331 social media gets all these ad impressions but not necessarily get the dollars
8768332 category by category year over year were up double digits
8768333 im no longer here to save us im here to save me
8768334 in here in here i can do whatever i want to you and no one can do anything about it
8768335 wow that sure sounds different than what i thought about catholics but surely someone certainly not the speaker of the u s house of representatives would get up in front of the world and tell a brazen lie like that must be true
8768336 well nobodyd say something that outrageous if it werent true
8768337 are not satisfied that this courts intervention by way of extraordinary writ is warranted at this time
8768338 estas unidades juveniles buscan como prop sito trabajar en funci n de informar sobre los aportes de las leyes habilitantes as como de la conciencia social y pol tica del pueblo venezolano
8768339 vamos a defender estas leyes porque consideramos favorecen al pueblo
8768340 con la construcci n y la participaci n de los consejos comunales dentro de las pol ticas p blicas en este sentido tomamos como referencia que estos instrumentos abren las posibilidades a los consejos comunales para que participen en la planificaci n de las pol ticas publicas dentro de cada uno de los entes gubernamentales
8768341 difundiremos en las estaciones del metro el contenido de estos 26 instrumentos legales de esta forma esperamos que la gente pueda estudiar en casa los beneficios que traen consigo
8768342 es dar continuidad a los talleres que se iniciaron en el estado lara con los tecn logos para apoyarlos con la formaci n y la capacitaci n pues creemos que aparte del financiamiento que se les otorg para el desarrollo de sus prototipos tambi n es necesario atenderlos en la capacitaci n
8768343 este taller es uno de los fundamentales debido a que tiene que ver con la protecci n de sus prototipos una vez que hayan sido elaborados
8768344 no es s lo para hacer una solicitud de patente sino tambi n conocer los mecanismos para realizar mencionada solicitud ante el sapi y de esta manera no s lo fortalecer el sistema nacional de ciencia y tecnol gico e innovaci n sino tambi n protegerlos pero universalizando la informaci n que se tiene en cada una de las propuestas de manera que nos podamos enfocar en la socializaci n de los saberes y en la generaci n de nuevas tecnolog as a trav s del programa
8768345 se realiza con el objetivo de brindarles herramientas a los tecn logos para que puedan formular correctamente sus solicitudes ante el sapi y as responder a una debilidad que hemos visto en venezuela pues por desconocimiento de procedimientos requisitos t cnicos y administrativos muchas veces han perdido la oportunidad de llevar a cabo su solicitud y la protecci n de sus invenciones en el territorio nacional
8768346 fue necesario para ense arnos sobre el correcto llenado de las planillas de patente y este es de suma importancia para nosotros ya que nos garantiza que nuestro producto no sea copiado por otra persona o transnacionales
8768347 el taller es importante para nosotros porque consiste en c mo llenar el formulario y hacer la solicitud formal para poder patentar nuestros productos en venezuela ante el sapi
8768348 las expectativas e impresi n que causa en los ni os es bastante considerable y muchos de ellos se motivan hacia el estudio de la astronom a la f sica y en general a las ciencias b sicas
8768349 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
8768350 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
8768351 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control
8768352 ahmadinejad is the right person to meet with right now
8768353 if youre not riding the wave of change youll find yourself beneath it
8768354 barack writes his speeches himself this ones had 4 000 drafts and he was toiling on it last night
8768355 hes been there six times and weve got a good chance in montana
8768356 barack told us from the first we were going to compete in every state we believe weve got 168 safe electoral votes and 32 leaning our way oregon washington minnesota and new hampshire its a lot harder for john mccain to make the numbers work if we win colorado it gets very hard for him
8768357 i got a call from barack asking if he could talk to me
8768358 around the campaign we have this saying no drama in obama we have no time for intrigue
8768359 obama wants a flat campaign meaning everyone gets a voice we have unleashed independent initiative on a vast scale this is a campaign of smart young people one invented the idea of notifying anyone who signed up to find out who the vice presidential nominee would be via cell phone we got two million new contacts
8768360 if people worry about what obama stands for this 77 page book will have it all
8768361 hillary clinton has been amazing she called us she was right about how to play things this week it was there idea that hillary come to the floor to move the nomination by acclamation and shes going to be on the road all the time we could not ask for more
8768362 joe biden came to chicago and said treat me like staff
8768363 our people went crazy contacting our supporters it was the single best fund raising day weve ever had
8768364 tear the hide off us and i think theyll be good at it this will be a very close election ten percent have not made up their minds
8768365 es war eine positive prognose die das jugendgerichtsgesetz so vorsieht dass das schief gehen konnte war klar man hatte gehofft dass er sich ndert
8768366 o mundo acabar em chamas pois homens s o inflam veis
8768367 passar o os c us e a terra mas as minhas palavras n o haver o de passar
8768368 after numerous discussions around the league we officially released marcus this afternoon
8768369 this is a painful day because of our affection for marcus who is certainly a class act
8768370 we did everything humanly possible to trade marcus which would have allowed him to play under the conditions of his contract with us unfortunately we werent able to make that happen
8768371 while this concludes one chapter with marcus and the saskatchewan roughriders we have discussed the possibility of him remaining with our organization in a different capacity
8768372 its also very possible marcus will choose to play for another team in our league regardless though of what decisions marcus and mona make we wish them and their family the very best
8768373 theres been positive feedback but theres also been some adjustments that need to be made and we really need to sit down and talk about that and put our best foot forward
8768374 what are the adjustments that have to happen not to assume we got it all 100 per cent completely right
8768375 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8768376 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8768377 if they were not so interested in maximum density there might be some way to save the tree
8768378 the loose connector would have not been visible even if an inspector saw it the day before the fire
8768379 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8768380 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8768381 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8768382 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8768383 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8768384 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8768385 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8768386 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8768387 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8768388 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8768389 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8768390 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8768391 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8768392 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now
8768393 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8768394 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president
8768395 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them

8768397 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8768398 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8768399 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8768400 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8768401 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8768402 our government believes that the polar bear is an iconic symbol of canada
8768403 clearly we need to ensure that the polar bear does not become endangered or threatened in canada
8768404 we have a constitutional duty to work with a number of groups like the inuit on protecting the polar bear and we can also learn from traditional aboriginal and inuit knowledge

8768416 at amp ts consumer services agreement is substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable to the extent that it purports to waive the right to class actions require confidentiality shorten the washington consumer protection act statute of limitations and limit availability of attorney fees
8768417 conflicts with our states fundamental public policy to protect consumers through the availability of class action
8768418 the broader point is that companies like at amp t cant cheat people out of small sums of money and get away with it
8768419 its important to remember that this decision is based on an old arbitration clause
8768420 weve since revised our arbitration clause to make it more consumer friendly and other courts have upheld it we continue to believe a consumer is better off pursuing a claim under our arbitration clause rather than pursuing a class action

8768431 i heard plan b when it was announced and i was truly amazed by it

8768436 only he can decide if he wants to carry the tag of the greatest prime minister australia never had that was once used for howard
8768437 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
8768438 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more

8768443 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8768444 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8768445 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8768446 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8768447 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8768448 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8768449 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8768450 i think it still could be better especially i was 4 1 up in the first set and then i let it go to 4 all

8768457 in the age of 4 gasoline more and more commuters are turning to mass transit to get to work

8768464 we are acting under a mandate from gov ed rendell to operate this agency like a business and that means keeping costs under control
8768465 we took important steps toward that end again last year including by closing 10 underperforming stores this year we will continue to remake the business side of the agency as a state of the art specialty retailer

8768500 youve got correctional officers at both youve got similar correctional activities going on it would make sense that one entity would be overseeing all of it

8768510 criminalizing abortion discriminates against women and it has never been proven that the product of conception is protected by the constitution
8768511 the big problem in these countries is that while the law is on paper many times there arent the rules in place that would tell public health officials what to do
8768512 theres that gap between whats on paper and the reality women are living on a day to day basis
8768513 its historic and its a trend were seeing in the region
8768514 multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets
8768515 if its right that theyve arrested the man who was in charge i will sue him
8768516 this incident shows the need for an end to the random arrest of iraqis by the american forces which are against the human rights outlined in the constitution it proves for a fact that each iraqi might be arrested or put in prison without knowing the reasons
8768517 it is a message for the baathists to go on in their wrongdoings

8768553 i got on brilliantly with peter coates when i was manager of stoke and i got on well with the people at blackpool when i was there
8768554 i think it is impossible for him to play for england said uniteds manager
8768555 this will be his first start and i wont be playing him for the full game he will have to have a recovery period and therefore it will be very very unlikely that fabio would risk him
8768556 ok they kick off the group against andorra on sept 6 and you might think that even you journalists could play against them
8768557 but they struggled in that game last year and then they play in croatia and that is a very very difficult match you need players who are 100 per cent fit to play in a game of that nature we know he is not ready for that

8768609 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8768610 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8768611 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8768612 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more

8768639 whats happened what the premier has done is totally unethical and i would hope that the head office of the labor party has a strong look at it
8768640 i heard plan b when it was announced and i was truly amazed by it
8768641 to go against party policy in round one is bad enough to go against party policy and platform in round two as far as im concerned is unforgivable
8768642 youve got a government in nsw that has got a fairly big majority if the government cant get their bill through with their own numbers that tells you that maybe its not the right thing to do

8768647 you waited two and one half months after receipt of the affidavit to file this petition
8768648 your petition cites no reason to shorten the 15 days notice requirement in reality you are exploring a civil lawsuit for the estate of m hood
8768649 to move up the hearing date as evidence gathered from it could serve as a basis for a clemency application
8768650 its cubs versus sox said mt carmel quarterback jordan lynch a senior who lives a 10 minute drive from st rita but chose to attend mt carmel
8768651 most of my friends go to rita so the week we play them i turn off my cell phone
8768652 guys from both teams know each other and come from the same neighborhoods
8768653 but once the game starts none of us are friends
8768654 its a great experience to play in front of 10 000 or more where you can barely hear each other on the field st
8768655 its a rivalry that runs through the blood with players whose fathers and grandfathers went to rita or carmel said st rita coach todd kuska who played for the mustangs in 1989 when they beat mt carmel
8768656 we didnt have much to say to each other all week
8768657 no queremos que bussi sufra pero que no tenga privilegios
8768658 el veredicto judicial es razonable en cuanto a la condena
8768659 no queremos que antonio domingo bussi sufra tampoco nos gusta que tenga privilegios
8768660 lo que no queremos es que no tenga privilegios y siga viviendo en un country
8768661 vivimos un d a hist rico porque se termina con la impunidad
8768662 este es un d a hist rico porque la misma democracia que le permiti a bussi ser gobernador ahora va a permitir que est preso
8768663 nadie quiere venganza s lo un juicio justo queremos cerrar una historia y empezar a mirar hacia adelante
8768664 escuchamos una sentencia ejemplar y ahora s lo esperamos que se disponga la c rcel com n para los culpables
8768665 and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
8768666 anybody who left their job will not be allowed to return
8768667 they have become irrelevant and cannot be trusted anymore as educators
8768668 whats happening is a joke we came to school and the teachers told us to go home
8768669 but the new hamas principal says if we dont go to school for a week well be expelled
8768670 my salary and future are tied to the side that pays me
8768671 at the same time i am afraid therell be hamas procedures taken against me
8768672 they will turn the schools into centers for their black propaganda
8768673 and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
8768674 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come
8768675 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
8768676 preparing the youngsters for battle against israel about 200 teens dressed in the uniform of the hamas military wing showed off their new skills
8768677 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8768678 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning

8768684 i dont have to waste a lot of time to get the job done
8768685 you have to go back to the doctor to see if your medicine is working
8768686 when you get customization right then suddenly the explosive potential of technology can be unlocked
8768687 one of the mistakes of technology has been that its been too monolithic
8768688 immediately we find out whether a student has a deeper problem that regular teaching cant resolve
8768689 but we shouldnt be looking past the fact that the experimental evidence really isnt there for much of this technology
8768690 we go to the video and its like an instant replay
8768691 just wanted to let you know god loves you no strings attached thats why your gas is a dollar off today
8768692 people are not used to someone doing something for them for free really and truly for free and thats what god did he showed us his love by his son dying on the cross and that gift is free
8768693 you just experienced revolutionary love someone showed you revolutionary love no strings attached
8768694 actually the church has done a pretty poor job in communicating the gospel people think they have to be good enough or religious enough and join us in order to go to heaven but the truth is christians arent different from anybody else theyre only forgiven because theyve received a free gift gods love no strings attached thats the point
8768695 there is a huge amount of uncertainty as to why there are big natural swings in co2 levels
8768696 its clear from our work that the greenland ice sheet is very sensitive to carbon dioxide levels but its wrong to draw inferences about what will happen
8768697 you cant say that if you get to the level of 400 ppm the ice sheet will melt in the next hundred years because we dont know enough about the process it might be easier to create an icesheet than to melt if you reverse what you did before you dont necessarily get the same answer back
8768698 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8768699 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8768700 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8768701 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8768702 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet
8768703 more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8768704 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8768705 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8768706 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8768707 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8768708 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8768709 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8768710 were losing money as it is the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
8768711 foi a equipe que me deu a oportunidade de mostrar meu futebol agrade o muito nunca vou esquecer minha passagem por aqui
8768712 vou lutar pelo p o de cada dia vou correr dobrado e espero em quinze ou dezesseis jogos fazer valer a minha contrata o estou bem fisicamente fiz uma pr temporada de cerca de vinte dias e s me falta ritmo de jogo mas supero isso com muita dedica o

8768716 tive propostas da inglaterra da espanha e da it lia e foi importante porque eu vi o interesse e o respeito que o cruzeiro tem pela minha pessoa e isso foi fundamental para que eu chegasse diretoria e negociasse foi importante a confian a tanto do meu lado quanto do lado da diretoria
8768717 acho que um momento de permanecer e pensar no que n s temos nesses tr s meses que h grande possibilidade de conseguir o t tulo brasileiro de 2008
8768718 many colleges throughout the united states continue to experience incidents of anti semitism
8768719 on many campuses anti israeli or anti zionist propaganda has been disseminated that includes traditional anti semitic elements including age old jewish stereotypes and defamation this has included for example anti israel literature that perpetuates the medieval anti semitic blood libel of jews slaughtering children for ritual purpose as well as anti zionist propaganda that exploits ancient stereotypes of jews as greedy aggressive overly powerful or conspiratorial
8768720 such an event dangerously threatens our religious feelings it is not appropriate to hold it during the ramadan
8768721 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims indeed the prosecution relied as part of its evidence upon the president of the local shia community centre
8768722 250 gb month is an extremely large amount of data much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis currently the median monthly data usage by our residential customers is approximately 2 3 gb
8768723 n o tenho nada do santos o par um grande jogador e tem alguns clubes interessados nele mas o santos ainda n o nos procurou

8768725 my soul looks back and wonders how i got over
8768726 we dont want no two seats when all of us is tired
8768727 what would the world be like if nobody did a job they didnt want to do
8768728 amazes me every time i see it used in real life
8768729 any employee not producing value added work all the time is a waste
8768730 any autistic or other disabled person not keeping up with me and everyone else all the time is a waste

8768735 they should be pursued and caught what they are capable of doing is quite frightening
8768736 it is uncalled for to revive the ilaga given its terrible human rights record
8768737 under the law the mandate of the armed forces and the philippine national police is to go after firearms in the hands of those not authorized by law to handle firearms
8768738 we demand ms arroyo to immediately disarm and dismantle this armed group in the first place it is her security officials who are totally obsessed in vigilantism and instigated this through their call to arm civilians
8768739 who are not authorized to carry firearms and are taking up arms even with threat of killing people in retaliation for certain incidents is pure and simple illegal
8768740 ik sloeg veel aces dat hielp me wel en zij maakte veel fouten

8768747 its time the media started trumpeting mccains exciting story hes old and no one likes him
8768748 what even if they were made out of metal no way
8768749 preventing deforestation promoting afforestation reforestation and stopping peatland destruction are some of the cheapest and most effective ways of reducing global greenhouse gas ghg emissions
8768750 we propose the introduction of market mechanisms that can ensure investment is directed into these areas and a strategy to make this happen as quickly as possible
8768751 the prevention of deforestation and peatland destruction requires no technological development and little capital investment this method of reducing ghg emissions is dramatically cheaper than all other mitigation technologies currently available as low as us 0 1 per tonne of co2
8768752 the economics is startling if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on biofuel subsidies us 15 billion this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
8768753 one of the lowest hanging fruits of climate change mitigation
8768754 this is an important milestone towards securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger
8768755 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
8768756 del cual estaremos pendientes y daremos puntual seguimiento obviamente nunca le han dado seguimiento porque no ha habido llamada alguna o carta adicional que as lo haga ver

8768758 there are no stories in life there is only the slow accretion of choices and disappointments small victories and abrupt endings an accumulation of time and experience pushing toward change stories are only in the telling
8768759 the 19 companies participating in this mission represent the cutting edge of us innovation which can boost the efforts of china and india to meet their massive energy demands while improving the environment
8768760 we are bringing some of the most exciting technologies to two of the most dynamic economies in the world
8768761 to ensure energy security drive economic growth and address climate change through industry led solutions
8768762 a windfall tax on the huge profits of energy companies
8768763 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8768764 citizens are sending a loud and clear message to politicians and carmakers to shift fuel efficiency up a gear
8768765 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8768766 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the north pole area right now is covered with very thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8768767 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8768768 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the arctic ocean in summer by 2030 or so
8768769 manny pacquiao is considered the best fighter in boxing today and i always want to fight the best
8768770 i am glad we were able to make this fight happen because while pacquiao is at the pinnacle of his success and has defeated all of the top fighters he has faced i am going to show the world that it stops with me december 6 cant get here soon enough
8768771 when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have like my trainer freddie roach says i have what it takes to win the biggest fight of my life
8768772 my case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8768773 long honourable and occasionally blood stained record on the championing of diversity
8768774 in short i think it is long past time we shut up stop making public statements about a private dispute and get on with the job we are paid to do
8768775 i do not think it was appropriate for this matter to be conducted in such a public way
8768776 we believe that barack obama is a global celebrity who has a lot of fans out there
8768777 i get you i get where youre coming from and i get what your issues are
8768778 americans no matter the age will see that john mccain is ready to lead this country and barack obama is not
8768779 he had fallen into a deep cynicism over what had crossed his path plotted the imperfectability of man and read shaw and chesterton enough to keep his mind from the edges of decadence now suddenly all his mental processes of the last year and a half seemed stale and futile a petty consummation of himself
8768780 after these first couple of plants come online i believe we will be cash flow positive
8768781 in the case of geothermal the execution of that plan is all in our hands
8768782 the licensing side of our business requires convincing some other company to take the technology and deploy it into their marketplace and thats a lot harder to predict
8768783 geothermal usually takes much longer to be built weve tried to go with an off the shelf type of plant design
8768784 that allows us to exploit sites that frankly were passed over or thought to not be useful 25 or 30 years ago
8768785 we are going back through and tying up a lot of those opportunities
8768786 were seeing a lot of utilities recognize that geothermal is much more competitive than natural gas and has zero fuel risk exposure
8768787 every possible line of inquiry to trace the family is being followed up including an all ports warning and speaking to family and friends
8768788 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8768789 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8768790 there has been a lot of speculation in some sections of the media which has caused serious distress to the fosters family and friends such speculation is not helpful to our investigation and until we gain access to the house and complete our search and examination we are not in a position to make any further comment on such issues
8768791 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8768792 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers kirstie is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping she and her family will be found safe
8768793 current technology used to generate power can be economic at around 50mw when projects are small scale it is easier to secure financing for them quicker execution is possible and social and environmental dislocations may be more easily handled rather than constructing a single large project developers may wish to consider building a portfolio of smaller projects in a country or across the region
8768794 these figures show just how reliant the labour party is on the unions to stave off bankruptcy with the labour party divided and gordon brown vying for the title of britains weakest ever prime minister it is clear that ordinary donors are deserting brown and labours union paymasters are calling the shots
8768795 while we welcome the unions support it would be wrong to suggest that they are the sole source of the partys funding or that their financial support in any way gains them any undue influence in policy making trade union funding of political parties is the most open transparent and regulated of all party funding and is in stark contrast to the shadowy funding arrangements of the tories
8768796 is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing conditions is low
8768797 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8768798 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small quarter point cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8768799 with the economy set to contract over the next year the outlook for the housing market remains bleak
8768800 what began as a fall in prices is fast becoming a housing crash the governments public dithering over whether to offer a stamp duty holiday is making a bad problem worse
8768801 compared with other forecasters nationwide is usually conservative in its predictions of house price falls so when it tells us there is a big fall we know something very serious is happening all the signs are that we are at the beginning and not the end of a very painful process rather than dithering over crackpot schemes to prop up the housing market the government must act to help the many thousands in danger of losing their homes
8768802 the latest figures are excellent news for most passengers however the regular closure of parts of the network for engineering work causes substantial disruption and inconvenience to many passengers and freight customers as well as deterring others from using the network altogether
8768803 for rail to make its full contribution to our economy it is important that this disruption is reduced significantly we have been taking steps to ensure this happens
8768804 over the next five years nr must continue to carry out a full schedule of maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure together with a massive programme of enhancements to increase network capacity
8768805 we have been telling the industry for some time that passengers need accurate timely and coordinated information when engineering works take place
8768806 passengers recognise that engineering works are necessary and will tolerate some short term inconvenience for real long term gain but the rail industry should do more to inform passengers not only of the engineering works but also the benefits the work will bring
8768807 reducing disruption caused by improvement work is a central pillar of our plans in the years ahead delivering a railway at weekends to the standard we see during the week must be our goal and weve asked the orr for significant funds to make this seven day railway a reality
8768808 we are seeing the best levels of punctuality for 10 years with nine out of 10 trains running on time on many lines however we want to see further improvements and expect a major reduction in the delays which inconvenience rail users the most
8768809 we are looking at the current shift towards fuel efficient cars in the united states as a structural change in demand
8768810 we intend to respond quickly and flexibly to this environment
8768811 for the last few months the company began to say its previous target was impossible and theyve scaled back gradually so everybodys used to the idea
8768812 people have to be on their knees in front of me
8768813 an evening dress that reveals a womans ankles while walking is the most disgusting thing i have ever seen
8768814 it is right and proper for each nhs to use its own policies and standard operational procedures to meet the differing needs of their national populations
8768815 it shows that the systems are different but not necessarily better or worse
8768816 we have four diverging systems but they are still trying to deliver the same thing
8768817 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains geography at a stroke by not including them on maps
8768818 were in danger of losing what makes maps unique giving us a feel for a place
8768819 this is tragic they call this a map but it is so inadequate it has not been interpreted in any way it has no landmarks on it
8768820 the public need to know that what theyre getting on google is not accurate and isnt up to date
8768821 if we have any more violence we could withdraw the champions league final from rome its not an ultimatum just a message that we are keeping an eye on it
8768822 its not an easy draw for us and the overwhelming feeling after wednesdays game against standard li ge is that we are just happy to be involved
8768823 the tie against atl tico madrid is the one that stands out and will inevitably generate a lot of interest it will mean a lot to all the spanish players but especially torres
8768824 the pleasing aspect is that there will not be an awful lot of travel involved
8768825 given that our next two league games are away at liverpool and chelsea were particularly pleased that the game that falls between those two is at home against villarreal
8768826 in last weeks press conference i said i was less optimistic and im even less optimistic today
8768827 ive no idea whats going on its very hard to get communication with some people
8768828 i think it is impossible for him to play for england
8768829 thats my personal opinion this will be his first start and i wont be playing him for the full game it depends on how he feels at half time but it certainly wont be any more than an hour
8768830 and i dont think he is ready for that in fact we know he is not ready for that he will need to get a proper recovery get proper training if it wasnt such an important game you could see well give him a bit of a game but i cant see it it is too important for capello and england
8768831 maybe we have had a lot of luck so far but one day our luck will run out and then we will have to perform really well to win we know that we have to get much better and we will we know we have the quality i think the good thing is that even when we are not playing well we fight for each other we are going to improve but it has to be quickly because one time our luck will run out
8768832 i know him from the spanish squad and he is someone who can help us improve he also knows the premiership and he had some time at manchester city he plays on the wing and a player of his quality would fit in well here
8768833 we havent closed the gap in fact the gap has widened but the health of those who are most disadvantaged in life expectancy and infant mortality is at the same level as the rest of the population was eight years ago
8768834 the first thing is it is measuring and monitoring the problem we have really got as good a measure as any other country of the magnitude of the problem the fact that the government has had the courage to publish the bad news is important secondly we are taking it seriously the fact that we havent narrowed the gap means we have more work to do
8768835 toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8768836 in rich countries low socioeconomic position means poor education lack of amenities unemployment and job insecurity poor working conditions and unsafe neighbourhoods with their consequent impact on family life these all apply to the socially disadvantaged in low income countries in addition to the considerable burden of material deprivation and vulnerability to natural disasters
8768837 to move up the hearing date as evidence gathered from it could serve as a basis for a clemency application
8768838 constitutes a violation of hoods right to a fair trial and impartial judge and the allegations must be investigated
8768839 should preside over a fair process that would remove the cloud over hoods case instead of playing hot potato with this case
8768840 you waited two and one half months after receipt of the affidavit to file this petition
8768841 your petition cites no reason to shorten the 15 days notice requirement in reality you are exploring a civil lawsuit for the estate of m hood
8768842 to move up the hearing date as evidence gathered from it could serve as a basis for a clemency application
8768843 every effort must be made to make sure these paintings stay in scotland
8768844 they are very important to the country and the culture
8768845 its a lot of money and fundraising is particularly challenging at the moment you are dealing with the economic circumstances of uncertainty so that many people that might want to support such a thing may simply feel their own wealth is less certain than it might be
8768846 im very concerned for the galleries 50 million is a huge sum of money and in such a short period of time it is quite a terrifying prospect
8768847 the governments should see the wisdom that there is in investing as cultural tourism is an enormous earner
8768848 normally the galleries could rely on big corporate funding but i just cant see it because of the recession it makes fundraising much more difficult
8768849 the big three scottish banks dont have the money for this kind of thing at the moment
8768850 the dunard fund an arts supporting charity would only be able to put forward 1 million or 2 million at best
8768851 the national galleries have been given a significant funding pledge from scottish ministers around which a fundraising campaign can be built
8768852 scottish ministers are aware of the national importance of the bridgewater collection to scotland
8768853 the international position and prestige of our national galleries play a major role in attracting tourists contributing to our economy and promoting scotlands identity abroad
8768854 despite the fundraising there will undoubtedly be a shortfall in the amount of money required
8768855 at that point we will see how much money can be found and no doubt the scottish government will do the same
8768856 that has not happened yet and will not happen for a number of weeks but we accept the tremendous importance of the piece and the dukes generosity in offering it considerably below the market value
8768857 why are we even talking about this as nothing has changed
8768858 he was very cold and badly hurt and he was drifting in and out of consciousness
8768859 he had a block of wood on either side of the fence and was stepping over it when one leg went down between the wires we got him out called 999
8768860 he was injured but seemed ok in himself and was chatting away before being taken to hospital
8768861 despite being in his eighties hes a very active man and you often see him out cycling or in the garden
8768862 but lying out in the wind and rain will have come as a shock to him so well have to wait and see if his lifestyle changes once hes out of hospital
8768863 its going to be a massive challenge for us in front of their home crowd
8768864 im confident the boys can do it but its going to a tough clash
8768865 were playing with a lot of maturity more consistently now after showing glimpses of our best earlier in the season
8768866 cutting down on silly mistakes during the game has assisted a lot
8768867 weve been training hard this week and the boys are hoping to have a good following of supporters up there on sunday
8768868 considered by the code of conduct committee and was now being reported to open council
8768869 the documentation referenced by the complainant does not support the allegations
8768870 the committee determined that no further action be taken because it does not disclose a prima facie breach of the code
8768871 in my view rightfully aggrieved by some of the statements inside the document
8768872 in that case i will cause this report to be withdrawn therefore it will not be placed on public record
8768873 it will be corrected to have those names removed and i would hasten also to add in any case no person may use the names inside the report
8768874 my question is not to the substance of the report but is how you can take off the public record something that has been put on the public record
8768875 service providers are allowed to charge up to rm25 each time subscribers change their mobile phone service provider this will give the users choice and freedom to choose their service providers without the inconvenience of having to change their numbers
8768876 the nationwide launch for the mnp will be done in october
8768877 say hi next time you pass a bunch of cyclists
8768878 there was a fire and then in the process the brakes could not catch that appears to be the cause of the accident although investigations are continuing
8768879 they were up in the highlands just after you leave sigatoka
8768880 there was a fire and then in the process the brakes could not catch that appears to be the cause of the accident although investigations are continuing
8768881 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8768882 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning
8768883 we dont have a mobile phone network which is a shame i guess but certainly there are people we are talking to from a partnership point of view
8768884 wireless data is an interesting product i dont see it as a competitor to fixed data but i certainly see it as complementary and well be looking at things in that space as well
8768885 personally i think we can be number two in the broadband space
8768886 i think number one is a fair ask but certainly number two i think the rate of growth were experiencing at the moment is better than weve ever had were a solid business were making good margins we clearly want to be a significant player in this market
8768887 police will allege the woman was greeted by a 74 year old man who entered the home and then assaulted the woman with a weapon before proceeding to the bathroom and assaulting the wheelchair bound man new south wales police said
8768888 as a result of the incident the man and woman both sustained multiple stab wounds to their backs heads and chests
8768889 elvis presley johnny cash soul music and i have a big star tattoo
8768890 in a race almost as tight as hillary clinton and obamas run for the democratic nomination for president the poodle won by a dog hair with just a few hundred votes separating the top two contenders
8768891 poodles are currently the eighth most popular breed in the us according to 2007 akc registrations statistics and spent more than two decades in the top spot a true testament to their suitability as a family pet
8768892 you slept with my mother and now im gonna kick your ass
8768893 ja men ass syns ju liksom att man vatt me om ett annat typ
8768894 our main aim is to serve our local communitys reading needs
8768895 along the way we have also done our best to support australian books
8768896 this is a great opportunity to help an australian author as well as highlight the best books of 2008 for our customers
8768897 re create 68 with the goal of re igniting the riots of 1968 around the chicago democratic convention
8768898 it looks like that evil is starting to get to your soul
8768899 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8768900 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8768901 to develop equipment for potential combat use against ground based ballistic missiles
8768902 russia is saying once again that has the opportunity to overcome u s missile defense
8768903 such tests are planned in advance maybe but its unlikely
8768904 experience shows the most economical and quickly achievable countermeasures against the development of a missile defense system are so called asymmetrical measures
8768905 most likely this is an old topol maybe slightly modernized
8768906 these missiles are to be stationed alongside our border and they are a threat to us we have to respond somehow to this situation and naturally enough we have to take a military response
8768907 the remains of the fort at cramond are actually one of the most important roman sites anywhere in britain
8768908 although there was an extensive dig in the 1950s overseen by a local couple alan and viola rae this one will cover areas that have never been looked at before
8768909 we are hoping to find out more about the origins of the fort who might have been occupied there and at what time it may be that the romans were in cramond much later than we currently think
8768910 i cant wait to see the results the local community have always been very enthusiastic about the roman fort and im pleased theyre able to take part in these new excavations
8768911 we are not able to go into the building so we do not know what if anything is inside we are not making any comment on speculation
8768912 theres no need for an ambulance just take her straight to the morgue
8768913 the day passed uneventfully until shortly after 8 30pm when the train doors failed to open on arrival at edinburgh waverley and passengers were unable to get off the train
8768914 a cleaner attended at the conductors cab and observed gracie was asleep he was unable to be awoken and the emergency release was activated to allow access to the cab
8768915 he was eventually forcibly shaken and did wake up there was a strong smell of alcohol noticed on his breath and he immediately staggered on to the platform and had to be restrained to stop him staggering on to the tracks he was supported by other members of staff on the way to the office and admitted to having been drinking
8768916 mr gracie accepts that he went into work drunk on this occasion
8768917 hes ashamed of himself and accepts that he has a drink problem
8768918 it stems from a diagnosis he had two and a half years ago in the week running up to the offence a very close friend had died of the same illness and he was in a very emotional and grief stricken state
8768919 it must be remembered that taxpayers are footing the bill for an organisation which offers advice to businesses and new start ups but which on this evidence clearly has had difficulty running its own affairs
8768920 the average number of days lost per scottish enterprise employee is just over six days compared with a public sector average of nine and a private sector average of 5 8
8768921 i love the job but ive advertisement got other responsibilities the children a home life and an elderly dad who needs me and ive recognised that i cant have it all
8768922 but after all those years of getting up at 4am we can understand why she wants a change
8768923 her honesty and openness have helped make gmtv the success it is she is a tough act to follow
8768924 fiona is leaving gmtv but she is not leaving television
8768925 i often think about giving it all up but i love my job too much
8768926 afghan national security forces ansf and coalition forces killed over 100 insurgents during combat operations in helmand province
8768927 ansf and coalition forces were conducting security patrols when they were attacked by insurgents using small arms rocket propelled grenade and mortar fire sparking numerous engagements
8768928 were treating this like the real deal were getting ready just in case
8768929 what if i would tell you that ive a 22inch cock is that something you might be intrested in
8768930 tell drama is on my to do list right after inserting needles in my cock
8768931 if you need to put your phone on vibrating at the first meeting press one
8768932 unless carmen electra calls for an emergency titty fuck dont answer
8768933 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
8768934 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
8768935 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
8768936 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
8768937 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
8768938 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
8768939 we have been waiting for over 10 years for this day
8768940 its a dream come true for the surfing community of bournemouth
8768941 the reef will turn an unrideable knee high wave into a head high wave that peels perfectly for around 70m 230ft in length
8768942 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
8768943 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
8768944 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
8768945 its true that i spent some time regularly taking part in sessions with a psychiatrist
8768946 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
8768947 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
8768948 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
8768949 over the past two years qualcomm has been found to have infringed four broadcom patents abused the standards setting process and committed gross discovery misconduct and now has been held in contempt of a court ordered injunction
8768950 qualcomms conduct demonstrates a startling lack of respect for its competitors intellectual property industry standards setting processes and the courts
8768951 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8768952 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8768953 abreviado como g es el cgs unidad de flujo magn tico densidad o inducci n magn tica b
8768954 we had a chat and she said we completely understand what you are saying
8768955 the good thing is they are keen to speak to me and ask for advice in terms of facilities and making things better for sport in scotland
8768956 i dont regret what i said because what i said was misinterpreted
8768957 but in terms of the whole scottish olympic thing my point was that it would be ridiculous to think that we could support a scottish team with the current facilities the idea of representing a scottish team in the olympics is not ridiculous of course its not
8768958 i am proud to be scottish and am patriotic but at the moment they cant look at the results achieved by scottish athletes and say oh scotland won these medals alone we couldnt have done it without the support the british set up gave us
8768959 in the future if they are serious about it and serious to push scotland forward as an independent sporting nation then it is going to take a long time and a lot of investment
8768960 but of course it could be done we have the talent there look at british sport in the last ten years and how much thats progressed you could do the same in scotland but it would take a long time to do it
8768961 it would end up diluting the resources in britain and it would split everything up and obviously british team results would suffer too which i think would be a shame the bottom line is until scotland is an independent nation the international olympic committee wont recognise it until then its out of the question really
8768962 a proud scot and a very proud brit as well
8768963 the scottish governments overriding priority is to see an increase in sporting participation rates and the success of our four medallists can only be a major influence on our young people and help inspire the heroes of tomorrow
8768964 i will be campaigning and supporting maurice on the streets of glenrothes he is a first class candidate bursting with energy and enthusiasm
8768965 i hope that gordon brown will rise to the challenge of campaigning in his own backyard so that the voters can see for themselves the choices on offer
8768966 it is time for him to stop running scared and to stand up and be counted i will be in glenrothes will he
8768967 its no surprise and i think hes probably done the right thing its very hard not to resign after whats happened this year
8768968 we thought he would at least stay until the inquiries and the fallout had finished
8768969 the first week when the ticket system failed i would have handed in my resignation because the core function of what the fringe needed to do didnt work
8768970 it will suit the fringe board very well that he is going because it will look as if he is carrying the can there is a need to go to the top to identify the decision making failures
8768971 i didnt really expect anything except for them to look at me funny
8768972 but they were very cordial and i walked out of there with a scholarship that carried me all the way through school
8768973 brites history would not be complete without the stories of phillips felder and her classmate james l claiborne both of whom became the first black degree students at brite divinity school twelve years before tcu made the decision to integrate its student body
8768974 he taught us that we could stand up and do what was right and do it in peace
8768975 thats just the kind of person she was she met a young pastor felt that the people of fort worth would benefit from his message and she brought him here
8768976 its not that im a prude its just that when i grew up we were laughing at the funny part without the filthy part
8768977 tcu is very honored to be able to host the summit here at our campus and hopes that all the student leaders will be able to form relationships learn from each others mistakes and help be able to solve each others problems
8768978 we got an opportunity for a second position so we have two assistant directors
8768979 some of the duties that he trevino had were split into two areas
8768980 he was the ideal person you want working with students
8768981 i can say i never saw him without a smile that was always kind of neat
8768982 i always felt what theyre trying to do in their mission and on campus is very important
8768983 its the season opener and we just want to go out and compete
8768984 this is a good little run that will hopefully get us ready for conference meets starting in november
8768985 going to nationals was a really good experience for me
8768986 to be able to go and compete with a bunch of other runners felt like a stepping stone for me
8768987 to see guys my age break olympic world records made me excited
8768988 watching them made me think of one day doing something like that
8768989 the funds will play a significant role in shaping how the honors college will influence the lives of tcu honors students and impact the universitys academic community
8768990 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8768991 hey doj while youre there giving what we see as your silent treatment were going to go ahead and start making more money mkay kay
8768992 people hear stories about what is happening south of the border and dont necessarily realise that things are not as bad here we need to make sure they are aware of that as consumer confidence is very important to keep the market afloat
8768993 scotland has followed exactly the same trend as england it is no better up here than anywhere else
8768994 there are many reasons why lenders chose to tighten up their mortgage criteria and the fall in house prices is just one of them there is a shortage of funding in the lending markets which constrains lending across the uk we just dont think this idea would work
8768995 the housing market in scotland is still buoyant prices are still rising as opposed to the rest of the uk where they are falling
8768996 i would encourage banks to offer separate products for scotland relaxing lending criteria to take into account the fact that we have not got the same level of problem here as for example in the south east of england
8768997 it is a commercial decision for the banks to make what products they offer and how they decide to offer them
8768998 the housing market in scotland is not markedly different to that in the rest of the uk but the fact we have a number of successful banks does suggest they should perhaps look at tailoring products specifically to the scottish market
8768999 we are often used as guinea pigs for new ideas this should maybe be a situation where we could be the guinea pig for doing something different to give our housing market a boost
8769000 i dont think we can ever say anywhere in the uk is completely immune and scotland is already seeing some price falls such as the 1 8 per cent quarterly drop on last june
8769001 we would expect scotland to be seeing further house price drops perhaps not as much as other places in the uk because we know affordability is much more resilient than elsewhere but we have seen transactions drop to their lowest levels
8769002 theres lots of uncertainty because of the weak economy but theres no doubt prices are going to fall across the rest of the uk for the rest of the year
8769003 if nato takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8769004 the appearance of nato battleships here in the black sea basin and the decision to deliver humanitarian aid to georgia using nato battleships is something that can hardly be explained
8769005 let us hope that we do not see any direct confrontation
8769006 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea
8769007 nato is conducting a routine and long planned exercise limited to the western part of the black sea the exercise is not related to the crisis in georgia
8769008 a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8769009 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8769010 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8769011 there is no question of launching an all out war with russia
8769012 no one ever doubted that a russian army of up to 800 000 people was going to defeat a georgian army of up to 18 000 people indeed that has happened over the last two weeks the question though for russia is whether it wants to suffer the isolation the loss of respect and the loss of trust that comes from that
8769013 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8769014 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8769015 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
8769016 internet maps can now be personalised allowing people to include landmarks and information that are of interest to them
8769017 anyone can create their own maps or use experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge
8769018 these traditional landmarks are still on the map but people need to search for them
8769019 interactive maps will display precisely the information people want when they want it
8769020 we arrived at 9am more than three hours before our flight and waited for 45 minutes then we were told that the flight had been delayed due to technical problems
8769021 we were told to check back and some people left the airport but we have been waiting here as we had nowhere to go and had limited currency weve just found out whats happened and my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand it seems to have caught everybody by surprise
8769022 its been handled very badly if i handled my own business like that i wouldnt have one
8769023 they must have known something was going on as i only booked it yesterday
8769024 the airlines flights will continue to operate and the decision to instigate creditor protection proceedings means that the demands of existing creditors are frozen while we continue negotiations on an investment package which already are at an advanced stage
8769025 this is one more symptom of the damage being inflicted by soaring fuel prices which is why the uk government must use its own energy tax windfall to help the economy
8769026 as a kid i had bronchitis because of all the conditions i had around me
8769027 my parents did their best for me but i had a deprived childhood
8769028 you see your father having a drink or smoking and you pick it up you dont think anything of it you pick up bad habits because its learned behaviour
8769029 a few of my friends have fallen by the wayside from all sorts of social deprivation
8769030 its no surprise we have higher incidences of heart disease strokes mental illness diabetes asthma and bronchitis than lenzie
8769031 the area has the dreadful distinction of having the lowest household income in the uk it limits the choice of my patients in all areas of life from diet housing and clothing to recreation
8769032 trends that we have seen in a number of reports over the last 20 25 years show that the differences in life expectancy are widening
8769033 if you look at the fifth most affluent area of population in glasgow life expectancy is improving but if you look at the fifth most deprived which includes calton it is static it hasnt improved so there is a widening gap between the rich and the poor
8769034 you could argue there is quite a chunk of the population that has been left behind that has happened in an area where some of the policies havent done enough to attack that problem
8769035 around 45 per cent of my patients smoke but ive taken great heart from the numbers that are coming asking for help to give up
8769036 thats great and we do all we can to help but there are other things which government can do in recent times we have dealt with advertising of cigarettes and then with smoking in public places but i believe that advertising for alcohol and junk food should also be tackled
8769037 if we can get more genuine information about food which helps people make better choices then were a step closer to real change
8769038 it is important that the various agencies in the city band together in an innovative way to help these people on the first steps back to employment and a better life
8769039 these statistics are shocking but sadly familiar poor health has characterised the east end of glasgow for far too long it is absolutely inexcusable that life expectancy in glasgow is lower than that of india where 80 per cent of the population live in poverty
8769040 clearly the areas challenges are complex and will not be resolved overnight but action must be taken on the blights that have held us back for too long for example measures to tackle excessive alcohol consumption and a lack of exercise as well as addressing maternal health drug and alcohol misuse and early years provision
8769041 acaba de ter sua estr ia nos cinemas alterada para o dia 26 de novembro de 2008 nos estados unidos
8769042 no elenco principal esse pico rom ntico situado no per odo pr segunda guerra mundia conta a hist ria de uma aristocrata inglesa kidman que viaja a esse continente long nquo local em que conhece um australiano rude jackman
8769043 what if i recorded lectures and then someday the administration decided that just anybody could teach those classes and they didnt need the expert anymore
8769044 he was very cold and badly hurt and he was drifting in and out of consciousness
8769045 he had a block of wood on either side of the fence and was stepping over it when one leg went down between the wires we got him out called 999
8769046 he was injured but seemed ok in himself and was chatting away before being taken to hospital
8769047 despite being in his eighties hes a very active man and you often see him out cycling or in the garden
8769048 but lying out in the wind and rain will have come as a shock to him so well have to wait and see if his lifestyle changes once hes out of hospital
8769049 we are closing because of the credit crunch we had plans to build an extension to the home creating en suite rooms for our residents which is the way the market is going for nursing homes
8769050 the plans were all in place but the funding is no longer there our short term problem could have been solved with a long term solution but that isnt open to us
8769051 our residents were told about the closure and they were all offered a meeting with south lanarkshire council regarding alternative accommodation
8769052 i dont know the full reason behind the home being closed but i did agree with the findings in the inquiry
8769053 i thought what the sheriff said was right and we have always said we hoped lessons would be learned from this
8769054 staff from social work resources attended a meeting with relatives at greenbank nursing home to support them in finding suitable alternative accommodation
8769055 the owners of the home have notified us of their decision to close
8769056 we will be working with them on the required phased closure of the home over the coming weeks
8769057 i have no problem with them being evicted but the closure order effectively prevents me from letting the flat out to someone else or selling it
8769058 the action taken provides respite for communities which have been plagued by serious antisocial behaviour associated with this household
8769059 whilst we appreciate the measures which we have taken are extreme the persistent behaviour by individuals left us with no alternative and we would not hesitate to do this again in similar circumstances
8769060 it was a living nightmare they were party animals who had all the toerags of elgin coming through their house
8769061 it was constant noise with fights and shouting happening every night
8769062 this is the best thing that could happen these boys got away with murder they just went on a rampage
8769063 they have had no parental control apparently the council say they could be going to live with their father in zambia
8769064 the mother just put them in that flat to get rid of them she shifted responsibility i hope she is ashamed because her boys certainly dont act it
8769065 whatever the future may hold there is no denying that as far as ongoing positional warfare is concerned it is a case of advantage army and that the ltte liberation tigers of tamil eelam is being relentlessly forced to fall back from previously held positions
8769066 there is no turning back under any circumstances or influence now until every inch of land is recaptured and each and every terrorist is killed or captured
8769067 we may well make it the capital of a future region
8769068 i sell a kilogram of gold every day that used to be my monthly average a year ago
8769069 i think it is worrying its a pity more young people dont follow sporting heroes like chris hoy instead of these sorts of people
8769070 i think there is a link between the glamorous lifestyle rock stars lead and the behaviour of young people who look up to them that said there is no proof that young people are taking drugs because celebrities are doing it but i dont think it helps
8769071 the deceaseds family has requested that their privacy is respected at this difficult time
8769072 terri was a bubbly girl who was full of life and this has been absolutely devastating for her mum
8769073 i know she was really into pete doherty and his music she just thought he was really cool like teenagers do i suppose its just tragic when someone so young is taken away she had a lot of friends and i know they must be so upset
8769074 nothing lasts forever so live it up drink it down laugh it off take chances and never have regrets because at one point everything you did was exactly what you wanted
8769075 whats it gonna do is it gonna come our way is it not

8769084 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8769085 it was the most effective most powerful most important speech since he left the presidency we cant tell how it is going with voters but from a democrat point of view he teed it up for barack obama
8769086 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8769087 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8769088 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8769089 john mccain is a friend of mine and it really pains me to say this but hes wrong
8769090 president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8769091 the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8769092 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8769093 new chemicals forcing channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader
8769094 when i started out everybody told me that these bacteria do not have channels but we found them and theres a real sense of a paradigm shift at work here that people simply were not looking for this opportunity
8769095 my chance to observe the channels at work came from a group in america which had some evidence channels existed we took that to the stage where we found the channels opened and shut
8769096 in 1994 we made a series of mutants which allowed us to produce the mechanism by which the channel would open
8769097 then professor naismith got involved and 18 months ago we cracked it when one of the mutants gave us an open structure
8769098 that was one of the happiest days i have had for a long time this is the top of the mountain it opens so many doors for the future
8769099 you can never get rid of any bacterial species completely they are literally everywhere but where we see it making a difference is helping hospitals get cleaner and giving patients more effective treatment
8769100 we know in broad terms what the properties of these molecules should be and we will work with chemists to design it
8769101 would you stop using alex salmond in your speeches youre giving him a platform he doesnt deserve
8769102 the thing people like about alex salmond is not his policies but that his leadership is confident
8769103 the labour party has to rediscover its own confidence because our values beat his values into a cocked hat
8769104 its time to reassert labour values of fairness social justice and opportunity for all
8769105 i think that role of taking on salmond and holding him to account for all his policy failures and broken promises is a significant role for the leader
8769106 every effort must be made to make sure these paintings stay in scotland
8769107 they are very important to the country and the culture
8769108 its a lot of money and fundraising is particularly challenging at the moment you are dealing with the economic circumstances of uncertainty so that many people that might want to support such a thing may simply feel their own wealth is less certain than it might be
8769109 im very concerned for the galleries 50 million is a huge sum of money and in such a short period of time it is quite a terrifying prospect
8769110 the governments should see the wisdom that there is in investing as cultural tourism is an enormous earner
8769111 normally the galleries could rely on big corporate funding but i just cant see it because of the recession it makes fundraising much more difficult
8769112 the big three scottish banks dont have the money for this kind of thing at the moment
8769113 the dunard fund an arts supporting charity would only be able to put forward 1 million or 2 million at best
8769114 the national galleries have been given a significant funding pledge from scottish ministers around which a fundraising campaign can be built
8769115 scottish ministers are aware of the national importance of the bridgewater collection to scotland
8769116 the international position and prestige of our national galleries play a major role in attracting tourists contributing to our economy and promoting scotlands identity abroad
8769117 despite the fundraising there will undoubtedly be a shortfall in the amount of money required
8769118 at that point we will see how much money can be found and no doubt the scottish government will do the same
8769119 that has not happened yet and will not happen for a number of weeks but we accept the tremendous importance of the piece and the dukes generosity in offering it considerably below the market value

8769273 im surprised that you are surprised by what i say

8769283 one generation ago my mom was looking at whites only signs now were looking at the highest office in the land that could possibly held by an african american and hes going to accept this nomination
8769284 its just so humbling and it excites my spirit so much im so proud of my country and i know we have a lot of work to do i think the good thing is weve gotten so far down the field that a black guy like me would vote against another black person even for a high office if i thought he was terrible
8769285 this was not the most impressive display from chelsea it was a hard fought win on a bitterly cold afternoon in the north east but you cannot play derby every week and you get

8769308 top medical breakthrough of 2006 has to be the cancer vaccine for cervical cancer gardasil
8769309 experts are recommending that girls start getting the vaccine routinely at age 11 or 12
8769310 the lightning fast transition from newly minted vaccine to must have injection in the united states and europe represents a triumph of what the manufacturers call education and their critics call marketing

8769315 the overall effect of the vaccines on cervical cancer remains unknown

8769317 i ts so hard to even write a permission slip for school trip if you ask moms to sign up or dads to sign up for this the chance is we wont immunize as many children
8769318 keeping children out of school because they have not been vaccinated with the hpv vaccine is a serious precedent setting action it replaces parental medical decision making with government regulation which should be reserved for the improvement of the general public health

8769336 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8769337 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8769338 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8769339 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8769340 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8769341 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8769342 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8769343 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8769344 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8769345 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8769346 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8769347 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8769348 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8769349 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8769350 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8769351 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8769352 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8769353 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8769354 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8769355 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8769356 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8769357 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8769358 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8769359 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8769360 we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8769361 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change

8769364 why are you asking for a picture with a guy like me
8769365 realise that the pro abortion and pro euthanasia lobby believes it can be right intentionally to kill innocent human beings
8769366 the essential line taken by the papers authors is that it really doesnt matter whether the patient is dead or not
8769367 this new further slide down the slippery slope of anti life thinking is truly disturbing
8769368 whether death occurs as the result of ventilator withdrawal or organ procurement the ethically relevant precondition is valid consent by the patient or surrogate with such consent there is no harm or wrong done in retrieving vital organs before death provided that anaesthesia is administered
8769369 is really so good that traditionally unethical means can be justified
8769370 could we soon see euthanasia linked to organ donation could the altruism card of organ donation be played to add nobility to an otherwise morbid cause
8769371 think the concept of brain death has served us well because without it procuring organs would not happen and so organs for transplantation would be scarce rather than the concept being right they instead consider being served well to be what counts
8769372 who threatens rafah and tries to storm the crossing with no approval of his country will face an unexpected response

8769382 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8769383 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8769384 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8769385 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8769386 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8769398 new winds keys and doors what he opens no one can shut and what he shuts no one can open
8769399 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
8769400 forget the former things do not dwell on the past see i am doing a new thing now it springs up do you not perceive it
8769401 these are the words of him who is holy and true who holds the key of david what he opens no one can shut and what he shuts no one can open i know your deeds see i have placed before you an open door that no one can shut i know that you have little strength yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name

8769406 he who dwells in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him i will trust
8769407 surely he shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence he shall cover you with his feathers and under his wings you shall take refuge his truth shall be your shield and buckler
8769408 no eye has seen no ear has heard no mind has conceived what god has prepared for those who love him but god has revealed it to us by his spirit

8769419 en ese caso mis hermanos y yo tambi n podemos hacer un esc ndalo tremendo y m s fuerte que el ganso si nos lo proponemos
8769420 tengo una idea creo que de todos nosotros no hay ninguno que pueda igualar el canto del gallito as que tenemos que trabajar en equipo propongo que hagamos una cadena de ruido se oras gallinas las he escuchado quejarse de que sus pollitos se despiertan incluso antes de que el gallo cante no es as
8769421 pues bien entonces cuando los pollitos las despierten ustedes deben despertar a sus vecinos y stos a su vez despertar n a los animales que duerman m s cerca de ellos y as sucesivamente hasta que el ruido llegue a la casa entonces si el granjero y su esposa a n no se han levantado el gato y yo que tenemos permiso de entrar a la casa iremos a su cuarto y les maullaremos al o do qu les parece
8769422 creo que hasta ahora sta es la mejor soluci n pondremos en pr ctica este plan ma ana mismo y veremos c mo funciona

8769498 now when it seems hes not going to get his own way hes going to deny our vote on the issue its just outrageous

8769519 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8769520 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch

8769553 he knows his customer better than anyone else and distributors and people like me need to understand that and cater to that

8769575 we appreciate the opportunity to make this submission particularly because media attention regarding mr abramoff from newspaper editorials to late night comic monologues has made him into a caricature and has distorted a picture of a man who like all men is more than the sum of his tragic mistakes

8769577 past 20 months have been a difficult struggle attempting to raise our children by myself without my husband
8769578 in fact during the few years when he was receiving considerable income mr abramoff gave the majority of it more than 50 to projects such as opening and helping run schools for jewish children opening and running a kosher restaurant providing room and board and tuition to under privileged children donating property to synagogues and engaging in often anonymous acts of kindness directed at those around him

8769589 i always thought i was down with the movement but ive been travelling around and hooking up with some of the younger guys and they see me as a crossover i say i aint crossed over yet what do you mean
8769590 yeah i think there is a british hip hop scene that is just like 2 000 12 inchers sold to 2 000 hardcore fans across the nation
8769591 they have their hip hop nights attended by 500 kids who nod their heads away to a pretty streamlined hip hop sound which needs to be done on a certain kind of drum machine and uses a certain kind of sample that comes from a certain age
8769592 i still find some of the so called not so intelligent stuff entertaining though theres only so much chin strokey stuff you can take at a time
8769593 ive tended to go for a sort of slow release shock value i like to have that rewind impact did he really say that i love to do that theres been a massive bunch of stuff lately about therapy amy winehouse with rehab and charlotte church saying she needs professional help everyones talking about it its such a self absorbed scene with musicians and artists going away for a few weeks to get pampered with a bit of therapy ooh mummy threw my dummy on the floor when i was two with me the melancholy aspect of my lyrics is really a learnt attribute its done for effect mostly

8769596 i remember being quite stubborn about it almost locked them out of that part of my life
8769597 but now im older my dad came to see me at brixton academy and he came over to my flat and saw the awards and he said oh this is very good why didnt you tell me about this a few years ago he actually introduced me to someone as roots manuva so i think hes quite proud of me
8769598 within music ive always had that lyrical undertone of a kind of lost priest that character of the priest whos still preaching but preaching with two cans of tennents in his hands the drunks and bums of the world have some of the most poignant tales and stories and wisdoms
8769599 im trying to gauge a path through the whole malarkey of it
8769600 just concentrating on whats important to oneself is pretty hard
8769601 i was getting lost in all that and losing connection with the old club scene of just jumping on the mic my agents trying to book me into shepherds bush empire or brixton academy or wherever trying to get me to the next level and im out there playing at a jazz jam in some little pub in hoxton
8769602 thats the big fight cos there is more to the movement of music than just being in bigger arenas or getting more sales that to me is my biggest test when im around younger mcs or producers they scoff at me like look at you now look at that chain look at those glasses look at you i think am i getting sucked up by all this i thought i was one of the grimey boys
8769603 no one thing or one person can be the saviour of such a wide cultural movement

8769605 we made a list of all the things wed never seen in a film and then we tried to get them into the script
8769606 i didnt feel sure footed back then had i not taken this career path its likely that i would have just sat at home and waited for the perfect job to come along
8769607 my brother and i witnessed the instability of what our father did hed be working at a nightclub for a year then one evening we would say are you going to work tonight dad and he would say no were not playing there any more i remember thinking gosh this is tough i knew id have to get a real job when i grew up i didnt know what id do but it would have to involve carrying a briefcase and id definitely live in a house
8769608 i was placating myself i saw that as a more legitimate way to be an entertainer i understood later that i had wanted all along to try my hand at comedy but i was scared of the uncertainty sports broadcasting seemed like a more solid career less treacherous but as i got closer to graduating i knew i should try this thing

8769612 the cast was this really well adjusted group of people it wasnt the crazy drug addled snl of the 1970s and 1980s we had the advantage of seeing what fame had done to those people who had gone before the new intake was made up of anti celebrities who reacted against that excess i think people still respond to that in will he knows pompous big shots are ridiculous and that theres a hard fall waiting for them he has a pretty healthy outlook on the whole joke of wealth and fame and hollywood
8769613 i dont have this yearning to be respected or taken seriously but it does bother me that comedy isnt considered hard to do

8769634 this is tantamount to a declaration of war by hezbollah and if they will attack the lebanese army they will surely have no qualms about attacking the united nations interim force in lebanon unifil
8769635 the helicopter was brought down because it crossed red lines that hezbollah had warned the defense ministry and army command not to cross
8769636 sources also said that the resistance hezbollah considered the region very sensitive and hezbollah leaders have already stressed the importance of the location because it contained the resistances telecommunications apparatus

8769697 suffered severe emotional damage as a result of having been exposed to r d s raijons ongoing torture and that she was presently exhibiting symptoms consistent with depression anxiety and post traumatic stress
8769698 we seriously doubt that contact with the appellant moses would help her process the tragic events she has experienced
8769699 you cant make it on your own you need the government to help you
8769700 fed up with hearing the fib dems crow about how many areas in britain have no conservative councillors maybe this will dispel the myth the yellow on the left marks the local authorities with no lib dem councillors and the one on the right does the same for the conservatives twice as many for them as for us and if you consider that in the highly rural areas of the celtic fringe conservatives have a tradition of standing as independents it makes it even better for us so what were you saying again mr clegg
8769701 i think it still could be better especially i was 4 1 up in the first set and then i let it go to 4 all
8769702 i was lucky that i hold my serve there is much more room for me to play better
8769703 i feel overdue but youve got to win it to deserve it im always expecting more from myself i would love to win even more than what i do
8769704 yeah but wait until the impact of the tax rebates wear off or europes economy catches up with the decline or take your pick hits and things will get worse

8769716 we will make of these detainees parasites in their societies and we will not release them until they become like mummies empty and full of holes from inside like swiss cheese
8769717 i was shackled in iron cuffs that entered my flesh and a bag was put on my head as a certain music roared in my ears and almost deafened me they used to beat me up and kick me and my body was full of wounds and bruises after that i was sent to a doctor who asked me if i was tortured and i said yes but he didnt reply or say something then i was taken back and tortured again
8769718 the use of certain interrogation methods by the israel security agency isa involving the use of moderate physical pressure was illegal as it violated constitutional protection of the individuals right of dignity while recognizing the right of israel to protect its citizens from violence it reiterates that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as justification of torture
8769719 the use of torture in israeli interrogations and works for its complete prohibition
8769720 how common is the phenomenon of beating shackled palestinian prisoners
8769721 unfortunately i want to admit something that we are not fully aware of these cases are not all that exceptional in their quantity to my great regret many of them are not the subject of any complaint and are cloaked in various kinds of conspiracies of silence
8769722 moral legal and practical gravity to publicize it to examine how those responsible address it to clarify its absolute prohibition under israeli and international law and to demand
8769723 by providing the relevant bodies with useful information and tools
8769724 only metal devices are to be used and the tightening of the shackles should be undertaken to prevent injury to the detainee particularly to blood vessels
8769725 i was put in a small room and they beat my legs they put me on the floor then i felt one of the soldiers take something from the floor and beat me on my head and shoulders then they took me out into a concrete yard and tied my handcuffs to a concrete pole and made me sit on the ground and they beat me every hour or half hour they would beat me on the face

8769729 grave consequences of this action can be anticipated in advance
8769730 how can it be that these events keep repeating themselves and no one is bothered and this is the morality of the idf these are the most basic values to which soldiers should be educated from the start it isnt about palestinians its about normative behavior the most basic things how a soldier in the idf can commit such abusive acts it comes down to some kind of disregard for the lives of palestinians
8769731 criminal phenomenon subject to penalties under an entire system of offenses in israeli criminal law
8769732 given this reality it is hardly surprising that an examination of the actual behavior of the military as distinct from its declarations also reveals denial evasion and obfuscation
8769733 when you deny thousands of people a day free movement it is impossible to do it in a nice way
8769734 tangible objectives for securing a drastic reduction in as short a period of time as possible toward the ultimate goal of completely eradicating this phenomenon
8769735 coalition of israeli palestinian and international ngos united against the practice of torture and ill treatment in israel and the occupied palestinian territories opt

8769740 if there is something all humanity can agree on at least theoretically it is that preserving individual dignity in difficult situations requires that we all conform to some elementary common standards of conduct
8769741 there shall be no violation of the life body or dignity of any person all persons are entitled to protection
8769742 there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment arrest extradition or otherwise
8769743 israeli law has abolished the death penalty for murder and corporal punishment
8769744 fundamental human rights founded upon recognition of the value of the human being the sanctity of human life and the principle that all persons are free
8769745 to protect human life dignity and assure that all government authorities are bound to respect these rights under this basic law
8769746 officially proclaimed a state of public emergency from 19 may 1948 four days after its founding until the present day
8769747 due to the ongoing state of war or violent conflict between israel and its neighbours and the attendant attacks on the lives and property of its citizens
8769748 from torture and other forms of ill treatment or punishment may not be violated under any circumstances and states of emergency
8769749 in the context of the arrest and interrogation of persons suspected of being security threats
8769750 israels sensitivity in dealing with human rights issues and the problem of torture and ill treatment makes any dialogue on these matter particularly slow and complex
8769751 may become overly reluctant to raise such issues systematically consistently and firmly notwithstanding their legal and political duty to put human rights in the centre of their foreign and security policy
8769752 apparently not the subject of torture and ill treatment given the political realities in israel and the opt progress in preventing and eradicating torture and ill treatment must be regarded as a mid and long term goal
8769753 there is never a good moment to raise human rights questions and always a reason for not doing something
8769754 strongly and consistently promot ing full compliance with basic and absolute legal obligations to protect individuals most fundamental rights

8769761 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs

8769766 im prepared to preside over legislation that will take a comprehensive approach
8769767 include that drilling let it compete and see where we come down on it and if that in fact is a good alternative then that is something that we should do

8769775 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8769776 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8769777 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8769778 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8769779 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia

8769791 in a race almost as tight as hillary clinton and obamas run for the democratic nomination for president the poodle won by a dog hair with just a few hundred votes separating the top two contenders
8769792 poodles are currently the eighth most popular breed in the us according to 2007 akc registrations statistics and spent more than two decades in the top spot a true testament to their suitability as a family pet
8769793 oh yes liz i show up there sundays too on occasion because there was never a more perfect church
8769794 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8769795 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8769796 please tell us what injuries your client suffered with necessary evidence from a doctor we would then make proposals for compensation

8769805 whats happened what the premier has done is totally unethical and i would hope that the head office of the labor party has a strong look at it
8769806 i heard plan b when it was announced and i was truly amazed by it
8769807 to go against party policy in round one is bad enough to go against party policy and platform in round two as far as im concerned is unforgivable
8769808 thanks this will be great for running the low end customer scenarios let me know when my main workstation comes in
8769809 if you look at log files or system events to understand what is going on in your machines or in your network a lot of people look at their textual logs and the problem is you have 100 000 lines or more so its really hard to figure out whats happening in that data
8769810 if you generate a picture from that data you very quickly can see what is going on in there
8769811 if there were more tools out there to make this easier i think a lot more people would actually use visualisation
8769812 with firewall log files you dont need to know what specific ip address is connecting to me from the outside
8769813 you can cluster it to get a general idea of what happened and then if you want to drill down you can open up that cluster
8769814 if you correlate it to the users you can find violations very quickly
8769815 thanks this will be great for running the low end customer scenarios let me know when my main workstation comes in

8769818 to move up the hearing date as evidence gathered from it could serve as a basis for a clemency application
8769819 constitutes a violation of hoods right to a fair trial and impartial judge and the allegations must be investigated

8769829 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns

8769840 n s tivemos dois bons resultados fora de casa mas agora diante da nossa torcida temos que buscar o jogo desde o in cio e impor o nosso ritmo o internacional um advers rio de muita qualidade e eles n o podem gostar da partida
8769841 uma equipe realmente perigosa mas n s temos que aproveitar a for a da nossa torcida e fazer valer o mando de campo o sport tem jogado bem e tenho certeza que vamos voltar a vencer na competi o
8769842 felizmente eu tive uma chance e consegui encaixar uma sequ ncia de jogos independente do esquema de jogo tenho atuado como segundo volante n o algo que mude tanto vou continuar trabalhando forte para conseguir ajudar o sport
8769843 foi muito bom saber que o leandro bomfim treinou bem a semana toda perguntei se ele queria viajar na mesma hora o jogador se colocou disposi o para ajudar o vasco neste momento de recupera o na competi o o bomfim estar conosco mas ainda n o sei se o coloco desde o in cio contra o gr mio

8769846 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
8769847 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
8769848 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently
8769849 the government already forces us to pay save for lots of things already one for retirement

8769858 there should be a constitutional convention for the sole purpose of abolishing the comelec
8769859 it is now incumbent on the comelec to go beyond the mere declaration of the candidates so if the law says make sure that the candidate observes the finance limitations under law then comelec should just use its own intellectual resources to find out how it can check the mere declarations of the candidates
8769860 the election law prohibits premature campaigning why dont you issue a declaration or a statement that you disapprove and warn the practitioners of the practice of posing as commercial models to gain publicity in advance of the 2010 elections
8769861 they would still be given a month to complete their salvaging operations or until october 7
8769862 the salvors titan and harbor star said they would need 10 days to mobilize and install the salvaging equipment and to conduct an initial survey in the area where the ship capsized
8769863 thus asean will ratify its constitution even ahead of the european union whose charter was rejected by two countries
8769864 if all 10 member states ratify the charter by december it will enter into force in 2009
8769865 we wish it were a more perfect document but because of the varied cultures of our region it is very difficult to get a consensus on a document that will govern with legal force the affairs of these member governments
8769866 it was also the philippines who took the initiative in providing for an asean human rights body now part of the charter
8769867 accidently left behind at some rest stop near the redwoods
8769868 with the fighting appearing to continue and the security situation remaining volatile it is likely that tens of thousands of families will be displaced over the coming weeks
8769869 to avoid a humanitarian crisis the icrc plans to distribute food rations to 325 000 persons over the next four months
8769870 when you compare this with the number of people displaced in just two weeks you realize the extent of the problem furthermore displacements were short lived in the past usually lasting only a few days this time some civilians are already in their third week away from their homes leaving their fields unattended

8769874 the arroyo government better not be stubborn this is just a prelude to a nation wide transport strike we are gearing up for next month if our demands are not met
8769875 if this is the arroyo regimes way of recognizing the bites of monthly record breaking rates of pacifying the people in the anticipated round of increases in the prices of canned goods vegetables and other food products and of evading again the legislated p125 wage increase we warn her to stop her delusions
8769876 the p5 cannot even adjust the cost of living its not even par with new minimum jeep fare of p8 50
8769877 all the oil cartels lame arguments have already been debunked we are expecting a big or substantial rollback in oil prices and no less
8769878 there is a portion in the law that amended the intellectual property law that allows to do parallel importation pursuant to the internationally agreed flexibility the law says that if a medicine has been imported no drug outlets must refuse to carry it they must have a set of medicine that they have to carry in their stores
8769879 alternative generic products to branded products that are prescribed by doctors
8769880 we also have the same question we want to rely more on the inputs of the industry in this regard so we will be awaiting whatever inputs the industry may have that we may adopt you may realize that this is a difficult provision to do on our own
8769881 this is not going to work i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8769882 even if they survived the impact they would not survive if they sank with the main body of the aircraft
8769883 we observed that it moved and its now about 1 000 feet underwater its now in a very deep spot
8769884 when the c 130 hit the water it was like a tomato being thrown against a brick wall
8769885 i doubt whether we could bring the aircraft or maybe a big part of it to the surface
8769886 i am very angry and i have to defend my airmen from the irresponsible claims that the c 130 is a widow maker and our aircraft as flying coffins

8769891 a hint of how long the cache is likely to be good for
8769892 previously what they have done was have a direct link to the trojan
8769893 but because those urls are now blacklisted so rapidly the spammers needed a way to bypass the filters they use these little swf files
8769894 in many instances the malicious software that is installed will be fake anti spyware or fake anti virus software that has infected the user tells them they are infected and suggests they pay for the full version of the product to clean their computer
8769895 there are just not as many analysis tools as there are for javascript or html for example
8769896 i will be interested in what comes next after shockwave
8769897 the governments reliance on the internet to disseminate and provide access to information has increased significantly over the years as have the risks associated with potential unauthorized use compromise and loss of the gov domain space
