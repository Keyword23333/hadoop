360003 hey guys i just installed everything on my mobo and it works
360004 these guys have done a great job and i just want to help them get to a common goal and thats winning a title
360005 i want to give us a chance to win every time to be consistent i think i have been could it be better maybe
360006 i thought id be kind of all over the strike zone
360007 i had good command of the curveball and the fastball
360008 a couple of days off and ill be fine im glad its now and not september
360009 as a result of jessica hardys withdrawal from the u s olympic team usa swimming will follow the published u s olympic team selection procedures
360010 according to the pre approved procedures swimmers from the existing roster will be placed in the open events kara lynn joyce will swim the 50m freestyle
360011 i think i had a lot of confidence coming into this year
360012 i think that was the main issue for me proving to myself that i can play at this level
360013 i definitely didnt have as good of stuff as ive had in a while
360014 my offspeed was not very good but i had really good fastball command
360015 this is the best chance for me and also for my team mates to win a gold medal i am in very good form right now
360016 all of us will be in top gear coming into the olympic games
360017 but i think the most important thing is to play the game well win and win over the fans with victory

360024 you get value for it because there are a lot of people who want to buy things with integrity but they dont know so when you have something with integrity it makes sense to tell people about it

360027 thats the level where it is heading thats the reality
360028 integrity requires justification if you get caught out you are dead
360029 people either believe you or they dont if you have a relationship based on trust if you ever mislead people it is over permanently it is a very stupid business decision to mislead people

360201 christianity came to west papua more than 100 years ago and most papuans eagerly adopted it to the point that christianity reinforces and now underlines their identity
360202 where papuan culture appears to be in the process of being eroded christianity serves to maintain local values and provide papuans with a strong sense of who they are
360203 papua is part of indonesia and christians need to live alongside muslims in a harmonious society the alternative is horrific and the malukus bear witness to this
360204 philippine education is in a deep crisis and sees little hope of recovery unless drastic reforms beginning with higher education are immediately implemented
360205 a disproportionately small number of poor students in the state universities and colleges
360206 the poor are discriminated more seriously in the better quality prestigious state universities and colleges like the university of the philippines diliman for they do not possess competitive college preparatory education
360207 there is also evidence that majority of schools at all levels operate inefficiently
360208 the unemployment rate among the high school and college educated has persisted over the last two decades at 9 percent or more
360209 much of the problem is rooted in finance especially the financial management of state universities and colleges

360219 we took care of him we helped him to do his baccalaureate
360220 he was in touch with fanatics while with us he used us to get money and information
360221 we felt that maybe fundamentalists sent him expecting that we would be harsh and beat him up
360222 i think hes a bit weak psychologically so they use him
360223 i dont think he is crazy perhaps strange perhaps there are others who are controlling him
360224 he said that because the parents are christians and because the girls told the court that they adopted islam their relationship has ceased
360225 the judge did not give me even a minute to speak with my daughters
360226 my girls have been with these men for the last 20 days they have pressured them to change their minds
360227 contracting marriage with a minor girl could mean that they want to have control of her with the intention of child prostitution or something else
360228 local police and judges have their subconscious mindset that if you help muslims in such cases its a very noble cause and a very religious cause

360426 he is as dominating as any pitcher we have faced this season
360427 the surprise to me was that he didnt come out of the chutes better
360428 hes not afraid to do things that are creative because they are things he knows he can do
360429 he is throwing a 98 mile per hour fastball he falls behind 2 0 and is throwing sliders to left handers thats too many things to think about
360430 the biggest at bat and he throws that juan marichal slider where he drops down three quarters he does it about once a game and the hitter has no chance thats why jimenez is elite

360441 we have a lot of competition and thats a good thing
360442 hes got two of the qualities you have to have to be a great running back beginning with toughness and competitiveness
360443 he will keep getting better as a practice player and as he keeps raising his expectations hell figure out i have to work harder on this i have to spend more time on this because hes got so much pride hes going to want to be good
360444 hopefully it will resolve itself in the very near future

360557 when chris tomlin sang that bigger things are prepared for this city i was thinking that it was not only paris that he spoke of but equally the people of god are a people who will grow the youth are the future and you can see that we are always more numerous more motivated and that the meeting places are filled for god for the student ministry started with only 2 people last semester we filled my apartment this semester we succeeded in filling a room on campus i dare to believe that one day well fill a small amphitheater and why not the bigger theater on campus we are only ordinary but we have an extraordinary god together with him we can accomplish extraordinary things

360601 i grew up in the district of alberta moving from ranch to ranch as my father found work
360602 when fred stimson started up his bar u ranch outfit in the shadow of the rockies he hired on my father as the foreman it was 1881 and i was 13 ill never forget those years riding over the open prairie stimson was a stickler for the open range there wasnt a fence on his property for hundreds of acres theres a spirit to the open country you know that instills a spirit of roaming of freedom
360603 i was desperate for adventure lord knows i got in enough trouble on the ranch running afowl of grizzlies buffalo and the occasional temperamental blackfoot but i needed something more like you said i wanted to keep roaming as soon as i heard the news that rebellion broke out in the saskatchewan i decided that was where i needed to be
360604 yes i was far too young but also too excited at the prospect of going somewhere and doing something to let something like honesty stand in my way i rushed right out to join the canadian militia and by the time i was ready to fight i was plunged straight into the battle of batoche
360605 it leaves an impression on a young man here we were equipped with everything from steamers to gatling guns pounding the settlement of that placid valley until they had no real choice but to surrender it was nothing but a handful of men women and children as worn out from being chased around the country by the government as from being hemmed in by our lines
360606 im sympathetic to humanity dr bristol my father taught me well that the language of a mans tongue and the colour of a mans skin dont amount to anything in the face of a mans right to make a livelihood for himself and his family in peace with his neighbours i cant support riels treason but i know what his people wanted it was the same thing i felt in the foothills of the rockies
360607 after i served my time in the militia i joined the mounted police as i said im sympathetic to humanity and being an officer of the queens peace here in the north west seemed the best path for me this way i could maintain the right and satisfy that boyhood yearning for faraway lands
360608 i dont think i could have stopped myself it doesnt get much further out than this thats why i volunteered to escort you as well before im done i might even make it to the north pole itself
360609 i say whats your name and how did you happen along just now
360610 and i have been tracking this bear for some time he is a man killer he gained a taste for human flesh and hunted for it across the arctic when i came back from the hunt months ago i found him gorging himself on my wife children and dogs i left him with that scar and when he escaped i pledged to track him to the ends of the earth
360611 well youve done a right good job of that i say
360612 and not a moment too soon now sup with us a while my friend youve earned whatever we can give you
360613 there is a valley spoken of in the legends of my people
360614 it lies on an island beyond our lands locked in the unending ice and snow of the underworld adlivun kivioq a great hero passed through this land on one of his adventures he decided to go far beyond where we lived and the land that we knew he came out in a valley where the rivers steam and the snow never falls there kivioq found where the inupasugjuk hunted their own private territory
360615 giants of the north they are huge and terrible and are rarely talked about amongst our people the animals in their lands were as huge as them bigger than anything here big bears big bison big deer and beavers there were strange things as well giants with arms and horns on their faces these animals are bigger and more powerful than even this bear i have hunted it is a fearsome place and we avoid it
360616 not cursed you white people think we think everything is cursed or magic it is just a fearsome place we value our lives too much to risk them on such things
360617 since you speak of it as a legend of your culture hero but do you know where this valley could be i mean besides being beyond the underworld
360618 yes we know we do not make up stories about things we do not know and places we have not been our stories are about our land and our people and our history they tell us how to live how to survive we dont have time for what you call fairy tales
360619 very good very good would you be prepared to guide us we can supply you with whatever your wants may be
360620 i say we value our lives too much to waste them in such places as this valley but i have nothing to live for now my family is gone and ive had my vengeance i will go with you and if necessary die with you
360621 you know what i am a bit overwhelmed in this moment and all i can really say to sum things up is wow
360622 in the end we each have to turn our eyes to the circumstances god has placed us in and be the change we hope to see in the world
360623 lord let glasgow flourish through the preaching of thy word and praising thy name
360624 in the end we each have to turn our eyes to the circumstances god has placed us in and be the change we hope to see in the world
360625 for the lord will go before you and the god of israel will be your rear guard
360626 o taste and see that the lord is good how blessed is the man who takes refuge in him
360627 boy youll never win cara voce nunca vencer youll never win
360628 boy youll never win cara voce nunca vencer youll never win
360629 evangelism is picking up the spoils of war that is won in prayer
360630 the least of you will become a thousand the smallest a mighty nation i am the lord in its time i will do this swiftly
360631 therefore as gods chosen people holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility gentleness and patience
360632 able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine

360640 we are suffering and this region is suffering from this menace of extremism and terrorism
360641 its rubbish we totally deny it this is a baseless allegation that the new york times keeps on recycling using anonymous sources these stories always die afterwards because there is no proof
360642 there is no question of any purge in the isi the government has already stated that there are no links or evidence of isi involvement in the kabul bombing
360643 it was in the past during jihad by afghan fighters against the red army in the 1980s that a few pro taliban elements had found their way in and with the change in policy have been firmly rooted out
360644 it is meant to defame isi this is a national institution which is vital for security the isi s role in fighting terrorism and extremism is exceptional
360645 as luck would have it it looks like here in mozambique is the only known location where we see both species interacting on the same reef
360646 we were just incredibly excited about this the work was very in depth and i think for the most part the group was convinced
360647 ive travelled to the ukraine brussels mali and the philippines since being declared a bankrupt last august
360648 i was offered a 2 000 us dollar honorarium to pay my creditors
360649 obviously they are afraid of what i might say about singapore
360650 we would assume that her honorarium earnings could be used to help meet her obligations to her creditors
360651 the younger dryas continues to surprise us in providing a message as to how quickly climate change can occur
360652 the hypothesis on this paper is i think a very nice one
360653 theres no doubt that we do this having reflected long and hard and recognizing the deep concerns and frustrations that canada has gone through over the nuclear history with india but you cant keep somebody in the penalty box forever
360654 the way were looking at it is that our relationship has been underperforming if not in the doldrums completely for a couple of decades now if not more and indias come a long way in terms of democracy and the rule of law and the whole nuclear constellation of issues has evolved to the point where we just cant continue with our position that has been absolute and negative to allowing india back into the nuclear club as it were
360655 the number of people coming here for free meals has more than doubled in recent months so tremendous has been the price hike
360656 another important factor is pakistans import dependency on basic food items as 80 percent of cooking oil and 20 to 30 percent of lentils are imported
360657 i feel like im in a movie where the background music urges me to feel things
360658 he was talking or praying so dramatically that i couldnt help but go on with the flow
360659 for greater things have yet to come and greater things are still to be done in this city there is no one like our god
360660 i feel like im in a movie where the background music urges me to feel things
360661 he was talking or praying so dramatically that i couldnt help but go on with the flow
360662 for greater things have yet to come and greater things are still to be done in this city there is no one like our god
360663 i am only one but still i am one i cannot do everything but i can do something because i cannot do everything i wont refuse to do the something i can do
360664 you we were made for more than this world sells all that this world has to offer is temporary it leaves us still hungry wanting more because you were made for something greater we were created to shine the spotlight on god to spread his fame everywhere we go
360665 greater things are yet to come and greater things are need to be done here
360666 greater things have yet to come and greater things have yet to be done in this city
360667 when are you going to start a radical change there
360668 lord use me and let me be as crazy as a fruitcake can be i will say yes to you
360669 if we are out of our mind it is for the sake of god if we are in our right mind it is for you
360670 probably acting on their own and going against official policy
360671 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
360672 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
360673 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organisation on pakistani soil
360674 sesungguhnya orang orang munafik itu melakukan tipu daya terhadap ugama allah dengan perbuatan pura pura beriman sedang mereka kafir pada batinnya dan allah pula melakukan tipu daya terhadap mereka
360675 dan tiadalah kami mengazabkan sesiapapun sebelum kami mengutuskan seorang rasul untuk menerangkan yang benar dan yang salah

360924 the problem with good ideas is that there are too many of them cant be measured good ideas arent hard to come up with strong ideas are unstoppable because theyre strong a strong idea can be a good idea but a good idea isnt always a strong idea
360925 he compared a video game development team to a band each has a core team of creative people surrounded by a larger team of people to help get the product done as an example he brought up the beatles and their legendary recording sgt peppers lonely hearts club band which featured hundreds of instrumentalists and a dozen engineers but was essentially the creative work of the four core band members

360927 quand on ne fait pas partie dun syst me le syst me veut vous d truire
360928 kudos to the u s house of representatives for introducing and recently approving h r 185 informing a mostly uninformed nation and world that jews christians and other ethnic groups were booted out of arab regimes over the years and forced to become refugees
360929 thus they implicitly deserve as much if not more recognition than so called palestinians who manipulate the r word as if it belongs to them exclusively
360930 approximately 850 000 jews have been displaced from arab countries since the declaration of the state of israel in 1948
360931 egad thats 100 000 more refugees than claimed by so called palestinians yet somehow someway all of those jewish folks shed the self defeating stigma of refugee status migrated to other nations including israel mostly picked themselves up by their own bootstraps worked hard beget generations of productive children some even becoming nobel laureates while those poor humiliated arab waifs claiming to be tossed out of israel albeit if truth be told mostly were persuaded to leave by arab invaders intent on annihilating the jewish state at her inception

360957 do you know what will cause you to have high walled palaces in paradise as a symbol of great reward and will cause you to be raised by god
360958 to be forgiving and to control yourself in the face of provocation to give justice to the person who was unfair and unjust to you to give to someone even though he did not give to you when you were in need and to keep connection with someone who may not have reciprocated your concern

360970 we are not seeing a catastrophic collapse in the job market like you often see in recessions
360971 what we are seeing instead is a steady hemorrhaging of jobs and that is going to continue until housing stabilizes and stops dragging down the rest of the economy
360972 parents dont push their kids to go to work in good times
360973 but they probably are doing so now with gasoline and food prices squeezing family budgets
360974 it will be our alaska gas flowing to provide aid to those in the lower 48 who are turning to alaska waiting and wanting alaska to help
360975 this is a choice between action and doing more of the same a choice between moving forward and the status quo
360976 it was the earnest effort of the last three administrations to get this gas line moving forward
360977 but the market is going to move this line forward my concern is this license is going to tie alaskas hands
360978 we work with oil and gas firms every day to get their gas to market
360979 the three largest leaseholders on the north slope are some of our largest customers in fact bp is our largest gas customer today on our north america pipeline system
360980 its not a done deal we are not turning dirt yet
360981 this is a very very significant and first step but there is a heck of a lot of work to do
360982 not just to have higher institutions with a social conscience but also a good solid investment that ultimately will benefit not only tens of thousands of massachusetts families but the schools themselves
360983 we cannot afford that right now and fiscally it would be an imprudent thing to do
360984 with something of this magnitude its incumbent on the administration to take the lead and try to find a solution
360985 over time many of our students and their families have relied on mefa and we welcome the opportunity to learn more about the challenges it is facing and to think about ways to address them
360986 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future 12 then you will call upon me and come and pray to me and i will listen to you 13 you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart 14 i will be found by you

360988 and will bring you back to the place from which i carried you into exile
360989 the tool is the the ultimate time saver to building powerful social media accounts one of the secrets of top diggers stumblers navigators etc is being the first to submit stories already becoming popular on other social news sites
360990 i feel such frustration i seriously hope this makes everyone question every pool every point of water safety
360991 there are days im afraid to have my kid lifeguard for the city
360992 theres not enough pools not enough lifeguards the kids are out of control
360993 but still when something like this happens we review all policies certainly this week has been a time to pause and reflect
360994 i told my lifeguards at the beginning of the summer were not here to make friends
360995 now even on the street when i see someone running i want to yell at them to walk
360996 i had my dad come in and watch it with me it lets you know in a real way that it can happen it puts everything in perspective it got to me
360997 from now on im not going to say anything twice they have to listen to me
360998 under certain circumstances the optimistic effect could even over dominate the realistic effect
360999 the lack of realism could become a more important factor when the firms get bigger

361001 whats really great about this recession is that its forcing people to focus on who they are

361009 the core of our american democracy is the right to vote implicit in that right is the notion that that vote be private that vote be secure and that vote be counted as it was intended when it was cast by the voter and i think what were encountering is a pivotal moment in our democracy where all of that is being called into question

361022 the exhibition presents an exquisite collection of art works that make viewers ponder on the messages that artists want to convey

361024 travellers booked on the boeing 777 which carries the in flight mobile phone services will now be able to continue communicating with family friends or business associates on the ground while travelling in the skies
361025 the boeing 777 300 carrying the new system is operating on several emirates routes including services to europe and australia
361026 the installation of our system on board emirates boeing 777 aircraft is another first for aeromobile and clearly demonstrates our ability to offer our technology to airlines using either boeing or airbus aircraft the number of boeing 777s operated by emirates and other aeromobile customers means that this introduction is a key step in allowing passengers to keep in touch when they fly
361027 there has been overwhelmingly positive feedback since the service launched in march with between 40 to 60 per cent of passengers switching on their phones on flights where the service is available

361035 physical features will be driven by indicators of health youth and fertility that men and women have evolved to look for in potential mates
361036 while science and technology have the potential to create an ideal habitat for humanity over the next millennium there is the possibility of a monumental genetic hangover over the subsequent millennia due to an over reliance on technology reducing our natural capacity to resist disease or our evolved ability to get along with each other
361037 after that things could get ugly with the possible emergence of genetic haves and have nots

361041 gulf war veterans made an invaluable contribution to national security and peace in a volatile region
361042 this new panel will ensure that va benefits and programs adapt to the needs of these veterans just as our services have adapted for veterans of other conflicts
361043 im a retired marine of 25 years i retired in the year 2001 back in 1987 i was awarded the congressional medal of honor i got wounded many times by the same guy im still around

361045 service pension for a particular class of individual based on no eligibility requirement other than a valid certificate of qualifying service from the secretary of transportation or secretary of defense
361046 we hold that the agencys requirement that a claimant have been present within the land borders of vietnam at some point in the course of his duty constitutes a permissible interpretation of the statute and its implementing regulation and we therefore reverse the judgment of the veterans court
361047 guilty of fabricating his service record and lying about his achievements and combat injuries to scam more than 18 000 in disability benefits from the department of veterans affairs
361048 va does not now have a payment system or the appropriate number of trained personnel to administer the program
361049 accomplishes our goal of returning the gi bill to the level established following world war ii
361050 it only makes common sense that if you come up with programs like smoking cessation that it is going to save money in the long run
361051 i think it is clearly something that needs to be looked at
361052 i would love to see that changed because these guys have paid at least as high a price some of them as anybody with a traumatic brain injury as anybody with a shrapnel wound
361053 until there are sanctions that make a superior pay a price for harassing a soldier with mental health problems i dont know that it will change that much
361054 just sucked it up and soldiered on they would could get over this
361055 the army is making a lot of strides toward changing that but its a slow go because it has to happen at the grassroots level
361056 this legislation protects folks from abusive credit card shenanigans and will bring honesty and fairness back to the credit card industry with food prices high and gas prices high this bill will add some common sense to the credit card equation
361057 no matter what you call it its bad business its unfair and it sneaks up on a lot of folks who work hard to pay their bills on time
361058 one of the problems i have in this case is this court is restricted by various statutes binding regulations and case law
361059 the fact that veterans are killing themselves at alarming rates is undisputed
361060 is taking steps to strategically plan its training but does not adequately evaluate its training and may be falling short in some areas of training design and implementation
361061 because the agency has no policy outlining consequences for individual staff who do not complete their 80 hours of training per year individual staff are not held accountable for meeting their annual training requirement
361062 and at present vba central office lacks the ability to track training completed by individual staff members
361063 a number of staff from one regional office noted that instructors were unable to spend time teaching because of their heavy workloads and because instructors training preparation hours do not count toward the 80 hour training requirement
361064 staff at another regional office told us that due to workload pressures staff may rush through training and may not get as much out of it as they should
361065 va will closely monitor and evaluate the success of our efforts to enhance claims processor performance
361066 active program for training evaluation driven by the administrations priorities
361067 increased revenue increased borrowing and reduced spending benefit cuts or some combination
361068 theres a long way to go in this process and fortunately it takes two houses of congress to send a bill to the president our position hasnt changed this is the wrong way to consider domestic spending and congress should not go down this path
361069 if i were able to sit down with john mccain for 10 or 15 minutes i honestly think that he would support this bill
361070 how can you tell a veteran thats been to war three or four times that its too rich of a benefit
361071 vas vital and relevant health care services on which so many veterans rely
361072 the era of wait and see is going to become the era of tell me right now
361073 were moving from a reactive dependence on voluntary reporting of product safety concerns to a proactive surveillance of medical products currently on the market
361074 you dont have to share with the fda a whole lot of detailed personal information about each case
361075 what fda mainly needs to know is whats going on in the population being treated by all these different components of our health care system
361076 in a best case scenario approximately 60 of these educational costs are currently covered for veterans and the ui grant will be a big help to current students
361077 shrugged off mchughs criticism saying difficult choices had to be made
361078 these guys have paid at least a high as high a price some of them as anybody with a traumatic brain injury as anybody with shrapnel wound and what it does is it says this is the wound that isnt worthy and i say it is
361079 i should point out theyve looked at this before and they determined that it was not appropriate to make ptsd a qualification for the purple heart
361080 they can say ah youve got something temporary itll go away so we dont need to pay you for the rest of your life
361081 we hear anecdotal evidence all the time that va is trying to cut costs by not diagnosing ptsd
361082 but weve never actually seen proof that it was being done in an organized way
361083 given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans id like to suggest you refrain from giving a diagnosis of ptsd straight out
361084 consider a diagnosis of adjustment disorder r o rule out ptsd additionally we really dont have time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine ptsd
361085 a single staff member out of vas 230 000 employees in a single medical facility sent a single e mail with suggestions that are inappropriate and have been repudiated at the highest level of our health care organization
361086 there are a lot of great people who work at va who have helped me and my friends we had to file the foia to get to the bottom of this is it from the head of the va the presidential administration or individual hospitals i would like to know where this directive is coming from
361087 vas leadership will strongly remind all medical staff that trust accuracy and transparency is paramount to maintaining our relationships with our veteran patients
361088 we are committed to absolute accuracy in a diagnosis and unwavering in providing any and all earned benefits ptsd and the mental health arena is no exception
361089 this whole scenario is playing out much like agent orange
361090 in some locations access to tricare standard providers remains a major concern for family members and retirees
361091 a simple truth of va health care is that its providers are the real backbone of the system if the providers are not present or are there but unhappy in their jobs it is unlikely that veterans will receive the quality care they need and deserve
361092 current law only allows the general schedule salary chart to be extended out an additional 18 steps
361093 since most of these employees are hired in difficult to recruit clinical specialties their salary is often set at the higher end of the pay range this limits their opportunity for future step increases
361094 unlike clinicians at most academic medical centers va clinicians may not fund a portion of their salaries through research grant support
361095 va clinicians typically must donate their time often performing research duties early in the morning or very late into the night after a long day of seeing patients
361096 va has hired nearly 3 800 mental health workers since 2005 and may add an additional 500 in the near future
361097 what impact does this have on the supply of mental health workers in the community both now and long term we need to be prepared to take a comprehensive view of addressing the problems
361098 some of what bothers me about whats going on right now in veterans health care is that veterans who live in rural areas dont live as long
361099 its not a va exclusive problem every hospital in the state of montana has a hard time recruiting and keeping people
361100 today veterans who suffer a service connected injury that requires continual medication or adaptive devices like hearing aids may not receive any disability compensation payments it is important that all of these veterans be compensated in a fair and equitable manner veterans with similar disabilities should receive similar benefits
361101 breakdowns in internal controls over the use of purchase cards leave the government highly vulnerable to fraud waste and abuse
361102 this audit demonstrates that continued vigilance over purchase card use is necessary
361103 the defense department cares about protecting personal information as well as increasing database security identity theft is a very real problem today criminals who pilfer ssn bearing identity cards can virtually assume someones identity through a few computer keystrokes and clicks of a mouse
361104 its important for people to understand that they need to take steps to protect themselves against identity theft they should be reviewing all credit card information review other financial account information and watch their accounts for activity that may not be theirs and then contact that bank or credit card company to make them aware of that activity people should call 1 888 505 1189 wellcare of georgia for further guidance or concerns
361105 disrupting irs returns processing and stealing sensitive information could wreak havoc on the economy and financial markets
361106 an unscrupulous person could divert data traffic through a third party system on its way to the intended destination
361107 there is significant work to be accomplished to address our information security deficiencies and we are taking aggressive steps to correct previously reported weaknesses
361108 he the judge looked at my tax returns and saw that we give money to the church and he didnt like that
361109 this is the phelps family summer home some are home and some are not
361110 in april 2006 there were over 250 000 unique patients waiting more than 30 days for their desired appointment date for health care services thats not acceptable as of 1 jan 08 we had reduced the waiting list to just over 69 000 our budget request for 2009 provides the resources necessary to virtually eliminate the waiting list by the end of next year
361111 they know that at some point this will eat into theater care or force readiness
361112 on a practical side if the benefit goes away thats going to cost retirees more in the long run than trying to adjust to paying a fair share for a program that has a good basis for increases
361113 we mostly focused on under 65 retirees most work and have access to employer sponsored health care plans
361114 my guess is that nothing much will change this year
361115 to honor members of the united states armed forces who served in the korean war particularly those who were killed in action are still missing inaction or were held as prisoners of war
361116 each person in our class did not get what they paid for
361117 common issues predominate these common issues are whether vista home basic in truth can fairly be called vista and whether microsofts windows vista capable marketing campaign inflated demand market wide for windows vista capable pcs
361118 an individualized analysis is necessary to determine what role microsofts windows vista capable marketing program played in each class members purchasing decision
361119 we are currently reviewing the courts ruling we believe the facts will show that microsoft offered different versions of windows vista including windows vista home basic to meet the varied needs of our customers purchasing computers at different price points
361120 may take into account the effect on potential future earnings caused by the age of the veteran at the time a disability rating is assigned
361121 this program is competitive with the private sector va has state of the art facilities high tech computer systems and professional colleagues second to none
361122 i expect va to comply with all laws passed by congress in developing and revising the rating schedule however our nations veterans deserve a forum where they can challenge the rating schedule when they believe that a statute passed by congress to provide compensation for the service disabled is being violated
361123 our design does not have superhuman strength or capability but it is closer in terms of function and power to a human arm than any previous prosthetic device that is self powered and weighs about the same as a natural arm it has about 10 times as much power as other robotic arms
361124 the rocket powered arm also has greater dexterity and freedom of movement than any other prosthetic to date
361125 you cant pick and choose areas where youd like to burn fat
361126 in order to burn fat you should create a workout that includes both cardiovascular and strength training elements this will decrease your overall body fat content
361127 you might want to warm up and stretch before a run but if you are lifting weights wait until after the workout to stretch your muscles
361128 consider eating a small meal or snack one to three hours prior to exercise
361129 load up your tank with premium fuel and choose some fruit yogurt or whole wheat toast
361130 most womens bodies do not produce nearly enough testosterone to become bulky like those body builders on tv
361131 they are the ones that occur naturally in foods like avocados nuts and fish as opposed to those that are manufactured
361132 including small amounts of these foods at meal times can help you to feel full longer and therefore eat less
361133 drastic measures rarely equal lasting results so start small and eliminate 100 300 calories consistently from your daily diet and you will reap the reward
361134 healthy or otherwise you still must be aware of portion sizes
361135 you must limit your caloric intake in order to lose weight however understanding how to balance calorie intake throughout your day can help you avoid feelings of deprivation hunger and despair
361136 while you can lose one and replace it with another the two never
361137 we associate late night eating with weight gain because we usually consume more calories at night we do this because we usually deprive our bodies of adequate calories the first half of the day start the day out with breakfast and eat every 3 4 hours keep lunch the same size as dinner and you will be less likely to over indulge at night yet you can enjoy a small late night snack without the fear of it sticking to your middle
361138 sweating is not necessarily an indicator of exertion sweating is your bodys way of cooling itself
361139 we dont know when theyll use the information they stole including processes and procedures that will be valuable to adversaries
361140 by local estimation there are 33 000 world war ii veterans in the omaha metropolitan area taking from national statistics the average age of these veterans is 83
361141 with the great numbers of aging veterans we feel an urgency to establish another national cemetery in eastern nebraska not only is it necessary but it would be a fitting gesture from a grateful nation as a final resting place of honor for our brave men and women who have served us it would be instructive to present and future generations to provide a place locally to view nationally significant memorials permanently commemorating the importance of their great service to this country
361142 mandatory funding for veterans health care means that veterans health programs will not be subject to the politics of the appropriations process
361143 this legislation guarantees adequate funding for veterans health without annual wrangling over spending levels i look forward to working with senator johnson and senator snowe to pass mandatory funding for veterans health care that fits within the budget and does not raise taxes
361144 what we have here is bureaucrats and government contractors coming in and trying to second guess what doctors and nurses have done in a hospital setting
361145 a little zealotry is what were looking for on the part of the taxpayers
361146 it costs at least 2 000 to run an appeal all the way through the process
361147 you need a physician looking at these daily if not more so to make sure the patients are being managed effectively
361148 as this population becomes older it will become more imperative for dod and va to identify and notify these individuals in a timely manner because they might be eligible for health care or other benefits
361149 precise information on the number of tests experiments and participants is not available and the exact numbers will never be known
361150 not supported by an objective analysis of the potential costs and benefits
361151 requiring the secretary of defense to conduct and document an analysis
361152 reservists and national guardsmen who serve multiple tours on active duty may get an increase in their educational benefits in keeping with the value of their service to our nation
361153 the ssa should not have withheld federal income tax from my social security benefits because i am a u s lawful permanent resident and my green card has been neither revoked nor administratively or judicially determined to have been abandoned i am filing a u s 1040 income tax return for the tax year as a resident alien reporting all my worldwide income i have not claimed benefits for the tax year under any income tax treaty as a nonresident alien
361154 that each approach should bethought of as supplementing or complementing the other
361155 official military discharge papers to reflect awards and medals they did not receive
361156 its not just about earning the tag but when you have a purple heart you get priority treatment at v a medical centers when this happens you cheat true veterans that need treatment for their wounds suffered in combat
361157 joint pain resulting in loss of motion does not constitute a mechanical basis for restricted motion
361158 the ability to have more full honors funerals for everyone all day long isnt there
361159 the group of people actually receiving them is much larger
361160 were also noticing other sites that offer tax related services getting targeted accountants and tax service businesses for example
361161 these scams are coming at taxpayer citizens on all sides gaining hold of their information
361162 its not that hard they just capture all of the graphic elements and the font and so on and then manipulate the information and questions
361163 irs is not in the habit of sending unsolicited e mails
361164 the few e mails we send are of the newsletter sort where were sending info to stakeholders no one should expect anything no matter how legitimate it looks
361165 with all due respect to the department theres nothing theyre going to do which is going to make tricare more expensive than what goes on in the private sector
361166 i know they have used that argument i dont know what theyre thinking
361167 willing to see a gradual increase in tricare fees co pays and deductibles as long as its not more than within the private sector
361168 if you could get any of that in writing i would love to see it
361169 we should not lose sight of the fact that although the youth population is large a relatively small proportion of american youth is qualified to enlist
361170 it is an unfortunate fact that many in the contemporary youth population are currently ineligible to serve
361171 we arrested eight patients last year what we call professional patients
361172 they were making a living by renting out their medicare number and going for treatments they werent getting
361173 because there are so many dollars so many claims getting paid theres a very good chance theyre not going to get caught
361174 with this task force theyve decided to do the right thing and go after fraud in a systematic manner and the results have been spectacular
361175 negligent for failing to maintain adequate computer data security of customer credit and debit card data which was accessed and stolen by a computer hacker
361176 thats not great news for consumers since with credit cards the user is only responsible for the first 50 in fraudulent transactions
361177 with debit cards there is no such guarantee also the money comes right out of your checking account which means a large fraudulent withdrawal could make a hell of a mess of all the checks and electronic payments you have in process
361178 the shocking part here is we now have personally identifiable information name and age linked to clinical data
361179 if somebody does not want to share the fact that theyre in a clinical trial or the fact theyve got a heart disease this is very very serious the risks of identity theft and of revealing highly personal information about your health are closely linked here
361180 we felt that we had some time to be thorough in our evaluation in the end that may or may not have been appropriate
361181 we pay for the printing but we dont always see all of it
361182 we dont support programs in the u s we never have
361183 we dont hold ourselves out as servicing vietnam veterans in this country
361184 making false representations in connection with the sale of goods or raising money can amount to fraudulent activity and can be prosecuted
361185 im just going to go full bore on this thing
361186 have got this one demographic group they keep pounding on and throwing money at yet theres a whole different demographic group that would be attracted to coming in and serving a term
361187 well established medical principles as distinguished from personal medical opinion alone
361188 unless evidence or medical judgment is such to warrant a finding
361189 builders problems are now threatening losses for small and medium size regional banks muscled out of the mortgage business by large national lenders many of these banks flocked to construction lending as the housing market boomed
361190 there have never been more elderly veterans in america than now there will be another 25 years of high demand for homes
361191 d refunds disregarded in the administration of federal programs and federally assisted programs any credit or refund allowed or made to any individual by reason of section 6428 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended by this section or by reason of subsection c of this section shall not be taken into account as income and shall not be taken into account as resources for the month of receipt and the following two months for purposes of determining the eligibility of such individual or any other individual for benefits or assistance or the amount or extent of benefits or assistance under any federal program or under any state or local program financed in whole or in part with federal funds
361192 no other health care organization provides this much information about its ability to care for its patients
361193 the large web of medical clinics doctors nurses money laundering companies and hiv clinic financiers who participated in this massive fraud
361194 support for vista has been battered across all enterprise sizes and corporate constituencies
361195 as a consequence the vista cycle looks likely to be materially less robust than indicated in our prior survey
361196 almost no feature of the new os is now seen as a meaningful positive driver for adoption
361197 from a company standpoint there is not a single damn reason people should use vista
361198 will you sell another widget because of vista no and besides vista has so many hardware requirements that you increase your costs
361199 might be confusing if theyre not savvy about electronic payments and dont have experience with a bank account
361200 i was doing good to walk to the mailbox to mail my medals back
361201 if i had a picture of that or if i could find enough eyewitnesses to say i had done that id be eligible for benefits
361202 let the people know about this and then let the public decide whats right
361203 this is great news for all of the project 112 veterans who have waited decades to receive proper health care its obvious weve gotten the committees ear and theyre interested in finally righting this wrong
361204 due to the lack of credible scientific and medical evidence that adequately demonstrates any statistically significant correlation
361205 the e mail raises potentially serious questions that may warrant further attention
361206 given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans id like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of ptsd straight out
361207 we really dont or have time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine ptsd
361208 this is a supervisor and it shows how the va thinks
361209 it was the action of a single individual that in no way represented the policies of va that once discovered was dealt with quickly and appropriately
361210 weve largely taken care of the needs of the army navy and the air force but the needs of the veterans affairs is absolutely huge
361211 they really need these houses these young men and women have got to have their families with them when theyre going through their rehabilitation and the house is the means that allows them to do that
361212 the long term signature wound of this war is the traumatic brain injury and that has a long term period of rehabilitation and that will be done by the va
361213 in retrospect i realize i did not adequately convey my message appropriately but my intent was unequivocally to improve the quality of care our veterans received
361214 one question that was raised repeatedly about this latest e mail was why would a clinician be so concerned about the compensation rolls
361215 as an oversight body we must know whether the actions of these va employees point to a systemic indifference to invisible wounds
361216 the e mail as characterized by others does not reflect the policies or conduct of our health care system
361217 we certainly agree that it could have been more artfully drafted
361218 given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans id like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of ptsd straight out we really dont or have time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine ptsd
361219 although our clinic is a treatment clinic we all fully support the compensation process and the departments policy of erring in the best interest of the veteran whenever there is any doubt
361220 it organizations are afraid that it will be a big project
361221 usually these are property crimes in which the drive is wiped clean and resold for profit
361222 there are a number of rules governing the handling of encrypted material and the mobile devices handling that material that employees must follow
361223 it is up to the employee to ensure that any sensitive material is encrypted
361224 these objects of historical and scientific interest may tell the broader story of the war the sacrifices made by america and its allies and the heroism and determination that laid the groundwork for victory in the pacific and triumph in world war ii
361225 historic landmarks historic and prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific interest
361226 well i discovered that i could talk when i was pretty young
361227 ten dollars this dog is amazing why on earth are you selling him so cheap
361228 because hes such a liar he never did any of that stuff he was in the navy
361229 unfortunately this analysis has not been done over to my knowledge in the last 10 years
361230 we realize it is unrealistic to have no increases ever
361231 means by definition that half of the people are not going to be paid enough to cover the cost of their college education that is why i still prefer webbs bill
361232 on educational benefits for career military officers while ignoring the 75 of service members that choose not to pursue a career in the military
361233 s 22 is an affirmative readjustment benefit designed to transition post 9 11 veterans into civilian life which is the same benefit given to the world war ii vets sen webb has consistently said that the military does a fine job at managing its career force but really fails to take care of their people once they leave the military the republican bill follows that same philosophy as veterans unemployment continues to rise and recruitment continues to fall we need affirmative programs that reward active duty service transition veterans into civilian life and target new pools of potential recruits
361234 there just seemed to be so many possibilities for abuse of the system and there were so few controls in terms of monitoring
361235 i know this is illegal and wrong to submit fraudulent claims to get money but i did it for fun
361236 he was getting off the plane with his golf clubs and they put him in handcuffs
361237 this is basically a death sentence for the company it will no longer exist and that will protect the tricare program since it was the biggest violator
361238 there were some very deceptive practices that were occurring the fact that this was a faraway location did add to the challenge of uncovering problems and they didnt get away with it ultimately which is the good news
361239 without sufficient evidence this can be difficult in an environment where law enforcement resources are limited providers are not always cooperative and are not subject to the u s governments subpoena power
361240 dr katzs irresponsible actions have been a disservice to our veterans and it is time for him to go
361241 the no 1 priority of the va should be caring for our veterans not covering up the truth
361242 is this something we should carefully address ourselves in some sort of release before someone stumbles on it
361243 it is completely outrageous that the federal agency charged with helping veterans would instead cover up the hard truth that more and more americans coming home after bravely fighting for their country are suffering from mental illnesses and in the most tragic circumstances committing suicide
361244 anyone at the va who is involved in this cover up should be removed immediately
361245 trial does not seek monetary damages but asks the court to appoint a special master or otherwise intervene to make
361246 even if we get 1 000 cases placed there are hundreds of thousands of claims
361247 we find that the va has simply not devoted enough resources
361248 to administer the programs of the second largest cabinet level agency a task for which congress and the executive branch are better suited
361249 even the decision whether to offer individual or group therapy to patients with ptsd
361250 dont have the tools and the information that they need to intervene effectively with suicidal vets
361251 the lack of information from the pentagon was one motivation for the rand study there is a major health crisis facing those men and women who have served our nation in iraq and afghanistan unless they receive appropriate and effective care for these mental health conditions there will be long term consequences for them and for the nation
361252 invisible wounds of war psychological and cognitive injuries their consequences and services to assist recovery
361253 we can conclude with confidence that there is no need to buy expensive vacuum cleaners or mattress covers or to use chemical methods against house dust mites because these treatments do not work if you are wondering why it is that mattress covers and the other strategies are not effective the likely answer is that all these treatments do not have a large enough effect on the occurrence of allergens from house dust mites the level of allergens is so high in most homes that what remains after the treatment is still high enough to cause asthma attacks
361254 it is difficult perhaps to realize that we cannot really do anything but there is no evidence to support these guidelines and they are misleading it is about time specialists start becoming honest with patients
361255 millions of us have grown comfortable with xp and dont see a need to change to vista its like having a comfortable apartment that youve enjoyed coming home to for years only to get an eviction notice
361256 it makes sense for microsoft to keep customers happy in the meantime while working on a successor version of windows
361257 a lot of companies that ive dealt with are of the opinion if it aint broke dont fix it xp is a stable environment and has a huge footprint in the market so for a lot of companies to move away from this stable system there has to be major benefits
361258 from what i can see a lot of companies dont see that in vista they dont see an incentive in moving across
361259 compensation and pension rules in a logical claimant focused and user friendly format
361260 the va mind set its as plain as they are going to get
361261 why dont you just stop if you know the drug induces suicidal thoughts
361262 we had to change the philosophy first and start making our vets a real priority
361263 it is far too soon to declare victory in the claims battle processing an initial disability claim takes an average of 185 days about two months longer than the vas goal getting a handle on incoming claims is important because the workload will only increase because of a combination of new iraq and afghanistan combat veterans with service connected disabilities and an aging population of veterans whose health and disabilities worsen with age
361264 as a result the pending inventory at the end of may was reduced to 390 000
361265 somethings going on here that isnt right that needs to be fixed i dont know what the hell it is
361266 its good law set up to guarantee that veterans have certain rights and they are protected its something we all agree with
361267 in various ways that have made it very difficult to administer and have added time to the process
361268 we then have to go back to the veteran to get the privacy form
361269 we are shortening that to 30 days so we can act faster
361270 simply drawing more money and more personnel to the problem clearly clearly has not been the solution
361271 what a rater is asked to do on a day to day basis is extraordinarily complicated we live in a world of complexity in my company we work with very challenging science we have never seen anything more complex
361272 va relays this exact information to its own doctors when it seeks medical opinion
361273 medical center management did not always validate the reasons for these unbilled amounts
361274 va still has significant weaknesses in their controls in billing follow up and collection
361275 they could be obtaining hundreds of millions in revenue from third party insurers if they addressed these weaknesses
361276 we found that va didnt have the full range of reports they needed to manage this at a high level perspective
361277 they didnt have information on the billing and collection process or formal procedures to provide them with that information
361278 we also found these centers had significant documentation coding and billing errors and performed little or no management oversight of the billing function
361279 we have for years had a net out migration not only for the state generally but for people with college degrees so one of our goals specifically delineated in the strategic plan is to reverse the out migration of people with degrees in order to achieve that we have to graduate more students and keep them here and also attract more from out of state
361280 if we are able to attract veterans to ohio we can link them and their families to internships co op and other opportunities and if they get good jobs here well have ohioans we want veterans to know ohio wants them to come here and that we think theyre incredibly valuable high potential students we already have a number of very good programs which well be expanding to provide the type of counselors advisers and mentors who can work one on one with veterans to help them make the transition to civilian life and navigate the academic environment
361281 since 2005 dod and va made significant progress modifying updating and improving the systems supporting injured service members and veterans
361282 the pdbr has no greater obligation to our wounded ill and injured servicemembers and former servicemembers than to offer fair and equitable recommendations pertaining to the assignment of disability ratings
361283 the purpose of the board shall be to reassess the accuracy and fairness of the combined disability ratings assigned service members who were discharged as unfit for continued military service the board shall operate in a spirit of transparency and accountability and shall impartially readjudicate cases upon which review is requested or undertaken on its own motion
361284 only the medical condition s determined to be specifically unfitting for continued military service as previously determined by the military department physical evaluation board will be subject to review by the board
361285 conditions that were not identified as unfitting are not within the scope of this board a determination of unfitting is generally unique to the demands of the service members military department these decisions are best made by the military departments
361286 if the new board does not address all of these factors i fear a service member may have to spend years going to multiple review boards to fix all the issues that led to an erroneous rating
361287 service members may appeal those issues to the military department board of corrections for military records or the discharge review boards
361288 the va office of inspector general investigates every credible allegation against va employees who betray the trust of our veterans and taxpayers by acts of bribery graft and criminal conflict of interest former managers of two other va consolidated mail outpatient pharmacies currently serving multi year prison sentences for similar yet unrelated criminal acts have learned just how seriously we take these allegations
361289 its just horrifying that you were able to take as much money as you did
361290 i would like to apologize to the department of defense
361291 i am truly sorry for all those who have been affected source air force times ryan j foley ap article 18 jun 08
361292 how to defraud the u s government and avoid prosecution
361293 this is ridiculous these guys were there they all have cancer take care of them
361294 the pentagon only began to disclose details of the tests publicly in 2001 after pressure from veterans and lawmakers two years later defense officials stopped looking for additional participants despite criticism from the government accountability office which said untold numbers of veterans and civilians could remain unaware of their potential exposure
361295 the remedies to the problems deficiencies delays and inadequacies complained of are not within the jurisdiction of this court
361296 have demonstrated that their members have suffered injuries in fact
361297 given the dire consequences many of these veterans face without timely receipt of benefits or prompt treatment for medical conditions especially depression and post traumatic stress disorder these injuries are anything but conjectural or hypothetical as va concedes delays in health care especially for mental health issues and delays in receipt of disability benefits which are often the primary or sole source of income for a veteran can lead to exactly the type of injuries complained of
361298 this issue is whether this and other relief sought by veterans for common sense are within the power of the court to grant
361299 the court finds that veterans for common senses individual members would have standing to sue
361300 stand willing to work with congress and va to resolve the many serious problems the court confirmed
361301 healthy teeth are an important part of overall health and our veterans should have access to affordable dental care this legislation would provide veterans with access to group insurance rates they may not otherwise be able to get on their own
361302 its a nice bonus for the children and families in need
361303 were proud that were sending money back to families who need it
361304 are not the ones to be calling the shots on constitutional matters
361305 by regularly rewarding better performance with better pay the participating organization will strengthen the results oriented performance culture
361306 among other things they will be better able to retain their good performers and recruit new ones
361307 with the levels of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd rising to epidemic proportions among our returning troops it is imperative that we educate our guard and reserve components about the mental health services they are eligible for so that no veteran or their family slips through the cracks
361308 i give 50 000 to my son joe provided he enrolls in college before age 21
361309 i thought someday my daughter would be able to look back and say how much i did for people
361310 now theyll only remember these proceedings im not going to be able to undo any of this
361311 they tell vets you dont need a lawyer well look out for your best interests
361312 bates represented them did stellar work for them and is now accused of committing a crime that reflects adversely on the legal profession
361313 it may well be that the veterans benefits system is flawed
361314 built a personally lucrative practice on the backs of those he professed to serve his misconduct was dishonest and illegal and it was undertaken to enrich himself
361315 i believe especially with gas prices where they are never should their mileage be an impediment to getting health care
361316 knowingly violated the law and ignored the intent of congress
361317 this action has intentionally read hazardous service conditions simulating war and instrumentality of war completely out of the law forces one to question his true resolve to care for those he sends into battle or orders to train for battle we can think of no other conceivable reason to circumvent the law as he has done here to answer the question of why congress need only determine in whose budget the disability compensation is deposited once offset by va we believe the answer to that question is the defense department budget
361318 rest assured that saving money was not the driver in the implementation
361319 the statutory intent of the law clearly and appropriately focuses the enhanced disability severance to those service members where the unfitting condition is a result of direct participation and performance of duty in the war effort
361320 we do not view this as an oversight we view this as an intentional effort to conserve monetary resources at the expense of disabled veterans
361321 no deduction may be made under paragraph 1 in the case of disability severance pay received by a member for a disability incurred in line of duty in a combat zone or incurred during performance of duty in combat related operations as designated by the secretary of defense
361322 as a direct result of armed conflict while engaged in hazardous service in the performance of duty under conditions simulating war or through an instrumentality of war
361323 attributable to the special dangers associated with armed conflict or the preparation or training for armed conflict
361324 clearly the statutory intent is to provide wounded warriors enhanced disability compensation
361325 saving money was not a policy development factor rather it was ensuring proper compensation for those service members who are wounded ill or injured as a result of armed conflict in the combat zone
361326 from continuing such blatant disregard for the law and for the livelihood and welfare of those who stand up to defend the country
361327 the va has had a hideous problem for a decade
361328 we have to suck it up and keep the promise that we made
361329 i put it up on par with social security and medicare
361330 so our thinking for the past year has been directed to looking at an alternative approach and we stumbled upon this advance appropriations technique
361331 we will still take mandatory spending in a heartbeat if they enact it
361332 but were trying to spread the word that this is the new direction
361333 we set priorities and we make programs compete against each other annually they would like not to have to compete
361334 theres 100 agreement with the veterans organizations that we must pass va appropriations on a more timely basis
361335 there may be honest differences on the means of getting there the easiest simplest cleanest way to solve the problem is for us to start passing va appropriations bills on time if that proves to be an impossible task well just have to look at the other options
361336 what this highlights is how dysfunctional the budget system has become
361337 and i dont blame them for looking for alternative ways
361338 because theres a lot of attention on veterans these days if anybody can do it they might have the strongest case
361339 but i think youd find a lot of other folks coming out of the woodwork saying hey what about us
361340 we are certainly aware of fda warnings and we took all precautions so it can be used safely all drugs have side effects or potential side effects
361341 we have a phrase to describe this phenomenon the disposable soldier syndrome
361342 demonstrates that the number one priority of this congress is veterans
361343 sends a clear message to americas service men and women their families and our veterans that we appreciate and we respect their service and sacrifice
361344 we need to complete the process i would challenge both sides
361345 if we cant get together on these we cant get together on anything
361346 desecration theft or trafficking in a grave marker headstone monument or other object intended to permanently mark a veterans grave
361347 individuals have reported receiving e mail or text messages indicating a problem with their account they are directed to follow the link provided in the message to update their account or correct the problem
361348 the link actually directs the individuals to a fraudulent web site where their personal information such as account number and pin is compromised
361349 we will never request your personal information such as social security number card number or pin through any of these methods
361350 god if you are real then i want you to knock me off this platform ill give you 15 minutes
361351 whats the matter with you why did you do that
361352 it is shameful that parents of a child killed in action are treated by a regulated savings and loan as if they were potential criminals by requiring that government issued bereavement checks be held to verify the authenticity
361353 check hold policy conforms with federal banking regulations and industry practices
361354 if congress determines that additional resources above the presidents request are needed congress must provide reductions in other appropriations bills to offset this increase and meet the presidents topline discretionary spending cap of 991 6 billion
361355 if congress does not offset this increase with spending reductions in other bills the president will veto any of the other bills that exceed his request until congress demonstrates a path to reach the presidents top line
361356 provides ample resources to ensure veterans receive the quality care they deserve
361357 this congress is dedicated to meeting the needs of our nations veterans no matter the political maneuvering of a callous president
361358 in all that time no law has been passed on behalf of sole survivors
361359 the hubbard act rectifies this oversight and honors the patriotic service and enormous sacrifice of the hubbards
361360 for these reasons plaintiffs believe they should continue to fight that their cause is valid and that judge conti was incorrect in holding that the courts are without power to grant veterans a remedy
361361 they members of congress dont feel they need to find the money because were not a very vocal group
361362 most of our members dont understand the process of government and how important it is to participate just to call their representatives in congress
361363 it seems that its unfair because they give it to you and then they take it away
361364 theres no record and no recollection of his service with the special unit other than mr levys
361365 being young 17 years old i wanted to help and do whatever i could for my country
361366 i just volunteered and went there were no orders i picked up my m 16 and my radio and went along on occasion they would ask me and i said yes i was 17 young strong and dumb
361367 all the other stuff was catching up to him what he went through was a crisis he didnt come out of it well
361368 embody americas lasting gratitude for the men and women whose lives are forever changed in service to our country
361369 with this legislation congress will leave no doubt that the blue water navy and all combat veterans of vietnam are intended to be covered and compensated thus ensuring that these veterans will receive the disability benefits they earned and deserve for exposure to agent orange this is the cost of war we asked these brave men and women to fight for us and serve their country and it is a grave injustice that they have had to wait this long for treatment we must place care of our soldiers among our top priorities this applies for all past present and future conflicts
361370 he has not taken the crime seriously and shown sufficient remorse
361371 this is a reason to have hope hope meaning helping other people endure
361372 in the past decade researchers have focused on the benefits of strength training in maintaining independence but until now we didnt have good evidence using an objective performance measure that a walking program would improve physical functioning our study found that walking offers tremendous health benefits that can help older adults stay independent
361373 aerobic capacity is really the engine that we draw upon for doing the things we want to do whether its cleaning up around the house or running a marathon
361374 by increasing their aerobic capacity the walking group was better able to perform their daily tasks and had more energy left over for recreational activities like going out dancing
361375 we know that walking is good for you but too many people still arent doing it

361379 if va really cannot distinguish between nonpartisan and partisan voter registration drives it should just allow both and advise va employees not to participate if they are uncertain since the hatch act is implicated only if va employees participate

361465 no this one really seems credible more than any other has
361466 you really believe this crap this sounds like something from a horror movie i bet you can find out what film its from online dont these people realize how busy we are
361467 in the past nine months since the killings began we have gotten more than 300 false leads we dont have time to investigate every one now get back to work
361468 sir i truly do believe that this girl is telling the truth she had cuts bruises and scars on her body i dont think she did them to herself
361469 all right since you feel so strongly about this why dont you bring in the girl and let me talk to her ill be able to tell if she is truthful within only a few moments of speaking to her
361470 im afraid i cant do that sir she didnt leave a name or address
361471 what you let her just walk away that was very unprofessional of you officer siena
361472 you just said that you thought i was wasting my time with this girl that it was just another false lead why are you now so upset
361473 how dare you question me just because you come from the nypd does not give you the right to speak to me that way now either find that girl or you are off this case
361474 youre telling me that my husband doesnt remember his own family
361475 so much of this story isnt adding up tell me again why you didnt call an ambulance when the accident first happened
361476 i told you i did call an ambulance but they said it would be a while before they could get through i am a nurse and decided to take him back to my place and wait for the ambulance to arrive before i hung up i told them my address they actually suggested that i take him home and get him out of the approaching storm
361477 why would they tell you to move him when he clearly had a head and possible neck injury that doesnt make sense and you being an r n should have known better than to move him you should have just waited for the ambulance and maybe this would never have happened
361478 i realized that my actions may not have been perfect but if it werent for me antanas would be dead i was told that by three different doctors and two nurses you should be thanking me not accusing me of trying to hurt him
361479 so how long are we going to pretend nothing happened
361480 i already told you i was sorry about before im not a violent person i dont know what came over me it wont happen again
361481 not that in the restroom earlier i saw your arms they were full of cuts and bruises where did they come from
361482 what else do you want me to say caelia i havent known you that long and i dont feel that it is any of your business youre my sisters friend not mine dont get us confused
361483 youre going to wish you hadnt have said that after i tell your mother
361484 well what else am i going to do rayna i cant keep the fact that you purposely hurt yourself a secret
361485 do you really want to tell my mother now after all shes gone through in the last few days
361486 i have something i need to talk to you about mrs alekseev
361487 when it left the bat yeah then it started drifting to left center
361488 and at the plate i wasnt sure what i was supposed to do with that very flattering
361489 this place continues to amaze me the way the fans welcomed him you only see that here thats pretty special
361490 it was not really that different its still the same game
361491 i felt more comfortable when the game started once the game started i got to relax
361492 there was some things going on with the team that were real and not just imagined
361493 there was a dynamic that had been created that made it more difficult for us to go play at our best and for players to perform
361494 i think it put us in a good position going forward from a baseball standpoint and from the standpoint of standing for something as an organization i think the team comes first
361495 we just had a meeting theres 25 guys down there that now feel like a team and it hasnt felt like that for a while and you have to feel like that in professional sports to perform at your best
361496 it didnt seem like we were handling the challenge up to what we were needing to
361497 there was a lot of doubt there were different versions of the deal that died and this particular version didnt truly get resuscitated until a couple of minutes before the deadline
361498 we have the best run differential in the american league and i think we have a chance to be the best club in the american league
361499 we lost one of the best hitters in probably the history of baseball but we gained a really good baseball player who can help us win so i dont think we have to catch lightning in a bottle
361500 we have to get back to being a team and go out and perform up to our expectations
361501 it started drifting on me toward center field but well take what we can get but a homer wouldve been something else
361502 it was one of those balls you hit and out of the box youve got to run hard because you never know whats going to happen
361503 it had a funny spin on it and you never know if hes going to be able to field it cleanly
361504 we havent been playing very well we need to continue this the rest of the homestand and take it on the road
361505 we have to look ahead all the time not just this year but what its going to look like down the line
361506 there was going to be a time when we had someone other than manny ramirez in left field and realizing that that time was probably going to be 2009 at the latest
361507 so looking forward we wanted to have a very productive hitter in left field we wanted to have a right handed bat to help balance our lineup and help complement david ortiz and others we wanted to have someone who could play the position who could fit the ballclub
361508 so jason was very much at the top of the list when it comes to who could be our left fielder in 2009 and conceivably going forward from there
361509 to make this transaction from a difficult starting point and ending up with jason as our left fielder and have him under a good contract for next year we think is a very good outcome
361510 next year jasons going to be in the outfield so we have time we have more time than we thought we were going to have
361511 thats a positive byproduct of this deal the major league need and focus always takes precedence
361512 everybody gave everything they had because were at home and because our guys pitched we gave ourselves a chance
361513 when they are both in the lineup and healthy that teams been very successful
361514 now its going to be different but it doesnt mean it changes the quality of their team theyre still going to score a lot of runs and theyre still going to have good pitching
361515 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
361516 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
361517 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
361518 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
361519 believe me if we could do our jobs without having you relive this terrible experience we would

361528 run negative ads on me continuously and i might point out for the record that his was the first
361529 youd think wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
361530 our politics is small when we need to be thinking big
361531 i admire his obamas campaign but what we are talking about here is substance and not style and what were talking about is who has an agenda for the future of america campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign that we have run
361532 yesterday he suggested that we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
361533 the mccain campaign has very clearly decided that the only way to win this election is to become very personal and very negative we believe that people will see that as nothing more than the same old politics and the same old policies of the last eight years

361540 we the 100 national and international ngo members of acbar express our grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
361541 but we need the continued support of ngos and the international community if we are to prevent further suffering
361542 it is imperative that they remain committed to afghanistan the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the un alone
361543 especially the increasing use of suicide bombings and other indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas and the use of civilian property from which to launch attacks
361544 are mounting an increasingly vigorous systematic terror campaign of threats abductions and executions aimed against members of the civilian population

361551 these are all new models with added standard features versus the previous generation and the a4 when equipped with the all new 2 0tfsi engine and quattro all wheel drive system delivers better fuel economy and acceleration than the key competitors in this segment
361552 especially after the a4 hit the auto show circuit and photos started to appear consumer interest increased as fuel prices rose the new 2 0 tfsi is a great engine add the new engine to the beautiful design and incredible vehicle technology and i feel that this is the perfect car for the time

361560 por nuestra propia historia el atleta mexicano tiene muchas complejidades psicol gicas que no le ayudan para ser un deportista triunfador en t rminos generales un ni o que quiere ser atleta y tiene las condiciones para serlo debe sortear muchas barreras psicol gicas como puede ser la sobreprotecci n de los padres que lo podr an convertir en una persona dependiente
361561 adem s a los ni os en m xico no se les ense a a ser disciplinados por lo cual cuando llegan a la adolescencia les costar mucho trabajo someterse a las rutinas estrictas que rigen a los atletas de alto rendimiento
361562 al mexicano le cuesta mucho trabajo asumir una postura heroica porque esto implica responsabilidad y sobresalir m s que el grupo inconscientemente genera envidias por lo que es preferible permanecer homog neo y no sobresalir
361563 por definici n somos un pueblo conquistado y por ende poco valorado ante nuestros propios ojos los mexicanos poseemos baja autoestima
361564 los triunfos de los mexicanos se presentan cuando hay una buena relaci n con los entrenadores que incluso pueden ser sus padres como por ejemplo arturo e iridia salazar y lorena ochoa quienes han obtenido triunfos a nivel internacional debido a su talento y una relaci n sana con su familia
361565 trat ndose de la selecci n brasile a esperamos algo m s inclusive de los jugadores todav a falta velocidad lo que es normal y ya era esperado pues al principio lo correcto y coherente es dar prioridad a la fuerza y resistencia

361572 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
361573 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind

361579 the following exercise is a tibetan sound meditation that brings you into a direct awareness of the space or silence from which all sound vibration emerges it develops subtle perception and intuition and has a very calming influence on the body and mind 1 sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes 2 let your breath be slow and calm taking about six seconds for the inhale and about six seconds for the inhale and about six seconds for the exhale breathe in this way for a minute or so before going on to step 3 3 continuing to breathe in this calm and slow pattern move your awareness into the sounds around you but instead of focusing your attention on the sounds themselves focus on the space or silence around the sound 4 get a sense of the spatial orientation of each sound that is notice if a particular sound is close or faraway above you or below you etc 5 try to get a felt sense of the space or silence around each sound you hear and of the greater space that holds all of the sounds including you practice this form for ten to thirty minutes longer if you wish practicing this meditation once a day for thirty days or so will generate profound benefits including a greater sense of calm and peace as well as health benefits associated with reduced stress in addition the consistent practice of this meditation will give you a deep and intuitive knowledge of how sound and vibration relate to your own consciousness

361590 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
361591 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
361592 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
361593 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
361594 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
361595 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
361596 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
361597 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
361598 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
361599 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
361600 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
361601 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
361602 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
361603 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
361604 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
361605 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
361606 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
361607 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
361608 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
361609 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
361610 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
361611 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
361612 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
361613 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
361614 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
361615 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
361616 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
361617 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
361618 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
361619 thats one of the things that defeated the soviet union
361620 re 7 29 08 propaganda 70 of us would die from em pulse attack by iran
361621 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
361622 u s intel iran plans nuclear strike on u s
361623 iran has carried out missile tests for what could be a plan for a nuclear strike on the united states the head of a national security panel has warned in testimony before the house armed services committee and in remarks to a private conference on missile defense over the weekend hosted by the claremont institute dr william graham warned that the u s intelligence community doesnt have a story to explain the recent iranian tests graham chairs the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse emp attack a blue ribbon panel established by congress in 2001

361667 early detection finished mammography is more trenchant in post menopausal women and more albescent women are diagnosed after the menopause this could vindicate the disparity in mortality
361668 we do not impart to oversimplify this subject but it seems country that at small conception of the phenomenon of increment mortality along interracial lines could be attributed to surgery directive to expedited ontogeny ontogeny in pre menopausal women
361669 we hit the accumulation from epidemiology now we requirement boost investigate to support these observations before we explore some needed changes in practice

362005 we want to be the no 1 company in engineered wood on the east coast
362006 my husband takes his lunch to work and we all eat a lot of sandwiches here
362007 there are things we can do to drive less but how do you eat less you dont
362008 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
362009 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
362010 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
362011 it reinforces the idea that were seeing a steady but not dramatic decline in employment which is likely to last for some time
362012 we came here last year on a saturday or a sunday and it was crazy
362013 i dont have to pay the tax on a new imac and i qualify as a student for a free ipod
362014 a tax free weekend was a good gesture by the legislature and im glad they did it
362015 we have to get it anyway so we might as well buy it now
362016 july is just slow and ive got to sell some clothes
362017 with gas prices the way they are every little bit helps
362018 theres a lot of emphasis on healthy living and green living
362019 people are thinking more about riding a bike to work
362020 no one likes taxes so it really seems to catch peoples eye
362021 its fascinating to see something happening in such a short time
362022 if its some jerk i went out on a couple of dates with i can do without that drama
362023 were in this mode where were telling everybody everything all the time
362024 it becomes about saying things just blathering on were at the apex of that trend
362025 you pretend to be communicating when youre actually stifling communication
362026 a phone conversation is like wildfire you dont know where its going to go
362027 were slaves to our devices blackberries and phones reachable 24 7
362028 though the decline wasnt huge it was very broadly based with only health care and mining showing anything that could be described as strength hours worked per week declined which is a bad sign for future hiring
362029 if we look at the job losses we had during the time people are calling a mild recession which was 2001 we were losing about 180 000 jobs a month at that time so clearly this is a different degree
362030 we dont like to see job losses obviously 51 000 is disappointing
362031 what were seeing is a mild recession interrupted here by a rebate program
362032 once consumers finish spending these checks well head down again
362033 a sign of how troubled our economy is that some analysts are greeting the seventh straight month of job losses and an increase in the unemployment rate to 5 7 percent as relatively good news
362034 the fed is stuck on hold trapped between a weak economy on one side and high headline inflation on the other
362035 what could rescue us is oil prices getting back down under 100
362036 our industry is under a bit of turmoil these days
362037 those issues are well behind us now for the first five months of this year us airways is no 1 in on time performance among the 10 largest airlines last year over the same period we were 10th out of 10 the facts are the facts our team has done a great job
362038 that now all pales to the financial crisis our industry is in while running a good airline is really important right now everyone rightfully is concerned about the viability of the airline industry and individual airlines
362039 if us airways alone tries to increase fares and everyone else doesnt match we end up losing more customers than we get by the higher fares while we all try to increase fares theres clearly a limit the result is we charge less than it takes to transport people on average and the industry loses a lot of money which is where we are now
362040 the industry will figure out a way to be profitable we will adapt the industry we end up with though is not one that anybodys going to like it will have fewer seats fewer flights to fewer markets it will become more like before deregulation when it was more of a luxury good than something people are used to using as a way to get around the country thats certainly not what were in favor of but thats where well end up i fear if oil prices stay where they are
362041 every 10 a barrel of increase in oil prices to us airways is worth 400 million if we can get 20 a barrel off thats 800 million we have analysts projecting us airways is going to lose 1 billion this year numbers were not objecting to
362042 were not fans of that scenario and dont plan on seeing it happen i think that whole scenario is flawed the fact is our profit margins are the best in the industry right now were certainly not the weakest performer or close to it as i told our employees if there are other airlines whose strategy is based on us airways going away theyre going to need to find another strategy we are not playing that game
362043 were trying to creative and figure out ways to cover the cost of transportation that is as customer friendly as it can be ive heard people ask why dont you just raise my fare its kind of a perverse argument i think why would anyone say dont charge me 15 for a first bag just add 15 to my ticket because that would affect everyone
362044 i have not because i havent checked a bag i never check a bag
362045 its been a while honestly i cant remember the last time i had a late flight i fly first class more often than not but other than that its no different from everyone else i dont get any special treatment
362046 and i share the frustration its not the same product it was 10 or 15 years ago but were losing a lot of money and we have to figure out ways to cover the cost of transportation
362047 im very very disappointed with the way this whole operation has been run
362048 everybody says the same thing were a joke were the laughingstock of the state
362049 the theater project is a primary reason for the financial challenges
362050 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
362051 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
362052 un positivo e costruttivo inizio di weekend abbiamo simulato condizioni di gara e sia lewis che heikki hanno fatto segnare tempi molto veloci domani la pista sar pi gommata e le condizioni saranno diverse quindi presto per dire con esattezza dove siamo rispetto agli altri

362054 i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i live in the body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
362055 one of the oldest continuously used christian science churches in the world
362056 even if i suffer in this path i know where ill go
362057 its a sacrifice we make to travel there especially in hard economic times
362058 but we have faith in god god is going to help us

362060 they had discovered the radiation leak weeks ago and did not inform the japanese government immediately
362061 the u s navys handling of the accident and lack of transparency showed there is no way we can trust them
362062 they had discovered the radiation leak weeks ago and did not inform the japanese government immediately
362063 the u s navys handling of the accident and lack of transparency showed there is no way we can trust them
362064 they need to be much smarter after the verdict and i think tayyip erdogan is aware of this basic fact
362065 the ak party will be more moderate i think in dealing with the constitution in dealing with the opposition and in dealing with other sensitive issues
362066 the akp has been given a yellow card until next time this is a verdict that will keep the akp under strict observation
362067 it will always keep the threat of closure over the party the debate and struggle for enhanced democracy will continue with the same sensitivities alive
362068 maybe they akp will think that they should put an end to this process so as not to cause problems with the army maybe they will be happy with the constitutional court decision and think that after a year or two they can deal with the issue if they behave like this it means that they do not understand the seriousness of the deep state problem in turkey
362069 continue calls for consensus in the sense of very radical concessions from the akp side and not touch hot potatoes such as the kurdish issue and the head scarf issue
362070 the case and the crisis more broadly appears to have accomplished the much needed task of awakening turkeys centrist forces which had been ejected from the mainstream in 2002
362071 i submitted a film called ogre its basically a reimagining of troll 2s plot
362072 i really wasnt sure on how well it would be received i mean there were some really good ones and i was really suprised we actually won
362073 but the best part is that they asked us to bring our monster down there and after they screened ogre they whipped up a tarp and they had the ogre standing underneath it and the host walked up to it with his microphone and said how does it feel to be here and all that and it puked for everybody it was just so cool not only to hear my film getting a lot of laughs but the monster itself i made
362074 sometimes i go and question whether i want to go ahead and be a filmmaker but i was standing inside the ogre and animating it while the ogre was being screened and hearing everyone laugh it was just so cool i told myself i need to be a filmmaker
362075 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
362076 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
362077 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personal
362078 we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
362079 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations
362080 so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
362081 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man
362082 he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pick up trucks
362083 i was personally responsible for transporting and getting out all families from afghanistan to pakistan
362084 this is a very difficult time right now and our sincere condolences and sympathies are with the family and friends of the brave soldiers and civilian who died
362085 we had to shoot him dead because we couldnt stop him
362086 we express our grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
362087 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
362088 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
362089 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
362090 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
362091 it is a new low for the international community to see all these state leaders going to beijing without saying anything about the repressive environment in which the games are being held
362092 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
362093 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power
362094 comments like those arent productive he should instead be focused on the generous incentives package weve offered
362095 at no time during the conversation did i threaten mr schultz in any way either expressly or implicitly regarding his continuation of this lawsuit or any other matter
362096 mr schultz told me that he did not believe the city had obtained in the settlement a sufficient commitment from the nba to locate a new team in seattle at some point in the future
362097 i explained to him that such a promise could not be made because these were issues for future deliberations of committees of the nba board of governors and the board itself
362098 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
362099 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
362100 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
362101 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
362102 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
362103 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
362104 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
362105 he should have rollled up his sleeves and laid into the tories instead we got a lecture on oil prices and how difficult everything is
362106 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
362107 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
362108 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance
362109 youre sixteen for gods sake did your mother let you leave the house in that outfit
362110 i know there wasnt a ceremony or anything but remus asked me to be teddys godfather
362111 but please if theres anything that i can do any time that i can help got more than i can use including some that you and he are more entitled to than i am
362112 can you imagine what old aunt walpurga would say if teddy or i were to step into that house the blood traitor and her half breed grandson
362113 well i turned my back on the black family long ago harry and i want none of what was theirs but thank you i think we will be fine but i cant say that a helping hand would be unappreciated raising babies is hard work
362114 and a child needs a man around sometimes harry i couldnt be prouder than if my teddy had you for a role model
362115 youve a life to live harry there are other worthy demands on your time and heart than this one i think
362116 she was my best mate at hogwarts tonks potions partners for seven years first hogsmeade date first kiss i mean not like we were
362117 if ever a bloke deserved happiness well i guess they had it even if it wasnt for very long
362118 speaking of blokes who deserve some happiness my little squirt of a sister wanted me to tell you that she has the rest of your birthday present and maybe you can come by this saturday to collect it that this saturday happens to be a day when mum and dad are going over to shell cottage to spend some time with the eldest and his lovely lady and that ginnys arranged for me to take george back to his shop for the first time well thats probably just a coincidence
362119 dunno what gift it is that ginnys got in mind for you and i really dont want to but whatever it is take it from me birds love to be thanked properly so do it right
362120 she talked all last autumn about how she missed them and now i see why
362121 his shoulders may not be as pleasant as yours but im rather fond of his sternum and he kisses rather well also he is very kind to my father without being at all condescending and not many people are
362122 i was very angry with daddy about that you could have been hurt and then you wouldnt have been able to help rescue me and mr ollivander and the rest daddy is wonderful but he is sometimes a bit lacking in vision
362123 hermiones stratagem worked they were very pleased with my father for being so cooperative they didnt beat him or curse him at all
362124 oh luna im so sorry your room we ruined it
362125 it was only the floor and my bed the part of my room that i truly cared about is perfectly fine
362126 i dont know that would be nice but harry even if i never find another friend to add to my ceiling the five of you will always be there and that will always be enough
362127 do not worry about young theodore your mother will take very good care of him nymphadora i am sure and harry will help her and we will help him
362128 the revaluation process will take place between and august 9 and 12 and all accounts will have new values on august 13
362129 it was agreed that the long heroes holiday will give banks sufficient time to slash the additional zeros from banking systems
362130 remember we had already taken off three zeros and so this wont be a difficult job
362131 banks expressed that they were fully behind the currency reform and were prepared to implement the new monetary measures
362132 we are very well prepared to meet customer cash needs in the new currency
362133 the question of power has been settled by the elections
362134 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president

362145 we can be with the best of the best out there it will be good to go out there and establish a passing game to help willie parker and the running game out
362146 guys dont write down numbers because its unrealistic you know what a set amount is that is attainable

362155 now they are coming without even a few rupees or clothes
362156 all they seem to have is the set of clothes they are in the situation is very very pathetic
362157 as long as fighting continues those who dont think they are safe in the war zone will keep fleeing those who can make it to colombo will go there others may head to india some families succeed some fail

362161 they have achieved remarkable transformations in the course of their studies
362162 coming into the mat involved putting aside a previous career path it can be hard to return to school after youve shown success in another field and have had considerable life experience all of this demonstrates a good deal of courage
362163 our graduates are being hired by a lot of good school districts despite this years tough job market and these schools in turn are lucky to have snapped up our students
362164 our hope is that the 2008 mat graduates will make long term commitments to education because i know they can serve children and families well today and can help drive educational improvements in the future

362173 boots on the boardwalk is our country night and were really looking forward to it
362174 there is a real nice buzz around town and i think wright is looking forward herself to coming here
362175 work started for this the first of the year in january when our meetings became serious but even after action week last year when we did the wrap up meeting to see how everything went
362176 you start talking almost immediately and get the wheels turning for the next years action week it really is a year long planning session
362177 it is a challenge but we have a formula that works
362178 we stick to our formula but we can tweak it we bring the entertainment up one notch or something like that the community steps up as well because a lot of groups or organizations do their thing as well during action week
362179 if you look at the brochure there are 100 things happening and about 14 or 15 are directly co ordinated and affected by the committee with assistance from the recreation department but its everybody working together that makes it a great packed nine days of fun

362182 i must stress that the nrl and not the clubs should look at paying on top of a players club contract a separate commercial contract for elite players
362183 an elite groups of say 30 players based on what that players is worth to the game commercially
362184 say the most a top end player can get from the nrl as a top up sum is 300 000 and the minimum is 100 000 then the average per player will be 200 000
362185 it would do a lot to stop high profile players leaving the nrl
362186 thirty players at an average of 200 000 would mean the nrl would have to find 6 million a season and would stand a much better chance of keeping its players
362187 i dont think 6 million is something the nrl given its turnover and its multi million dollar tv rights wouldnt be able to find in its next budget
362188 an elite contract would make it more attractive for those guys who people love to watch either live or on the box to stay in rugby league
362189 theres been plenty of criticism over how he left his club
362190 introduced a lot of confusion and uncertainty into the linux market which could dampen some of the future growth

362193 the sco lawsuit raises thorny intellectual property issues and analysts say poses the potential for more court battles as other companies assert rights to some of the communal code
362194 a team at redmond tasked with the assignment of studying the linux phenomena and trying to decipher a way to stop it
362195 you cant take back the fact that someone has tried to claim intellectual property on linux the genie is out of the bottle
362196 linux customers and vendors will be forced to consider their legal liability due to intellectual property issues
362197 the lawsuit represents more than just a licensing squabble between two companies or the efforts of a small unix linux company to dig into the deep pockets of ibm
362198 be forced to consider their legal liability due to intellectual property issues around linux and open source software
362199 some firms will put them linux deployments on hold until they get better clarity
362200 you wont see this thing settled for quite a while
362201 as the two products are integrated we have two or three fairly major products that will be released this fall we believe that solution set will give us a tremendous bridge for our current customer base to move forward on the new platforms
362202 educating people is fairly high on the list of marketing activities they should be engaged in
362203 but when someone makes a decision that theyre going to use linux the question we keep asking is is red hat going to get paid
362204 we continue to believe that the current stock price reflects an overly optimistic view of red hats ability to capitalize on the linux opportunity

362208 part of the settlement is an agreement to keep the terms and evidence secret so the public will never get the chance to see just how badly microsoft did or didnt behave a decade ago when it was in the middle of its rise to power

362216 i think you are a two faced cunt of a whore i think you need to grow up and take control of your own life before you take control of others i e matt i think because you dont like someone or something that he doesnt have to like that someone or something i think you are a controlling bitch of a female i think you need to grow up first impressions last a life time yanno you would do well to remember that

362222 there were far too many of them for us to control
362223 what were seeing is re recruiting and ongoing attempts by different armed groups to continue with the military option
362224 when you have armed groups in close proximity to each other and where we are not making progress on the political process the risk of an accident is always there and of course things can spiral out of control
362225 the problem is that in the areas that they control violence against civilians of various kinds and especially sexual violence has continued so that is a big worry
362226 were very concerned about what appears to be preparations for renewed conflict
362227 i think that they are ultimately afraid to disarm and to demobilise and they want to hold on to the land that they have through military means
362228 this of course raises serious questions about the governments commitment to the peace process in eastern congo
362229 i have underlined as i did a few days before in kinshasa that in the view of the international community an armed offensive against the arms group would be disastrous
362230 those responsible for the army in the east have underlined that there are no plans for a military offensive
362231 the participation of the homeschooling community was a very significant component of this process the voice of the community helped to ensure that we approved regulations which are sound and balanced we must make sure that our work with the community continues on this issue
362232 homeschoolers throughout d c and the 50 states in scores of studies and surveys have scored 20 to 30 points above the national average on the average on national standardized achievement tests also the publishers of the sat and act college entrance exams have tracked homeschoolers for the last 10 years and found that on average they score above the national average furthermore homeschool graduates who enroll in universities also do above average as the various studies and surveys in universities of their student body have shown
362233 these regulations create situations where educational bureaucrats are violating the fundamental constitutional rights of parents and are unnecessarily broad and difficult to manage they have breached the trust between the districts government and its citizens
362234 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create precedence and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapon activities

362254 instead of going to the house and thinking i dont have to plow today hes got to go to the house and study
362255 technology is driving this whole thing and that technology has made this a much more viable process than it was before

362508 de kostprijs van de 71 senatoren relaterend aan de eigenlijke dotatie bedraagt 1 053 281 euro per lid
362509 een opvallend gegeven is dat de senaat zeer geheimzinnig doet over die begroting
362510 voor de buitenwereld is ze niet beschikbaar en alleen senatoren quaestoren mogen de inhoud ervan kennen
362511 als we de kostprijs voor de 150 kamerleden berekenen na aftrek van de ep leden en de partijen verkrijgen we een totaal van 125 3 miljoen euro of een kost van 835 333 euro per lid
362512 dat bedrag ligt beduidend lager dan dezelfde berekening voor de senaat

362544 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
362545 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
362546 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
362547 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
362548 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
362549 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
362550 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
362551 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
362552 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
362553 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
362554 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
362555 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
362556 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
362557 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
362558 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
362559 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
362560 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
362561 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility they want somewhere thats difficult to escape from difficult to attack not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on diego garcia is ideal
362562 i was informed that the leakage may have gone undeteced for over a five month period and that the leak was discovered may have during a scheduled overhaul i have been informed that the amount of leakage was at a negligible level but i remain concerned about this news
362563 according to admiral french they take regular quarterly samplings and it happened to occur at the time when the sub was here the samples have been sent off to the us theres a specific site where they have it tested because its in such minute amounts we expect to get the results back by tuesday guam time
362564 what was found was slightly less than what you would find in a bag of commercial lawn fertilizer
362565 i was also in contact with adjutant major general donald goldhorn of the national guard and we have our civilian support team so that if there is any need to do further testing on our end theyre well trained and the admiral has also allowed them to have access to the exact berthing site if necessary
362566 i have to qualms about that at all in fact when the law came forward i wasnt in favor of the caps because you have to address the needs of the schools if the school has the capacity as well of course you dont want to make the schools overcrowded like if a school has a capacity for 1 200 you dont want to put 2 000 students in there

362721 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
362722 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
362723 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
362724 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
362725 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
362726 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
362727 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
362728 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
362729 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy

362772 i played well last week and had a tight match against nadal this week im playing well again you know hopefully i can do it

362792 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
362793 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
362794 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
362795 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
362796 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
362797 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
362798 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
362799 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
362800 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

362836 we suspect that the council have not set out to contravene or reverse their own equal employment policies and that this problem results from someone in the council acting in a thoughtless way

362863 hab a peores y mejores equipos en el bombo es un rival de nuestro nivel y la eliminatoria est al cincuenta por ciento que la vuelta sea en casa es una ventajita que podemos tener el schalke tambi n debe estar preocupado sabiendo que la vuelta es en el calder n sabiendo que somos un equipo que estamos creciendo y que hemos fichado bastante bien
362864 nuestro rival es un equipo fuerte pero vamos a sacar la eliminatoria adelante es un conjunto alem n potente pero en cualquier caso vamos a ir a por todas a nivel personal yo prefiero jugar el primero en casa y el segundo fuera pero los dem s dicen siempre que es mejor jugar el partido de vuelta en casa as que tambi n espero que esto ocurra en nuestro caso
362865 est claro que el atl tico no era el rival que todos dese bamos pero en la ltima temporada el schalke demostr que est a la altura de una competici n como la champions ahora se trata de prepararnos lo mejor posible para afrontar con garant as la eliminatoria
362866 vamos a ver si estos dos partidos de la gira son buenos o malos para la eliminatoria de momento lo nico que puedo decir es que mostramos el m ximo m ximo m ximo respeto por los dos posibles rivales la buena noticia es que jugar el 13 nos va a permitir ganar un d a m s para recuperarnos del jet lag la ventaja es que los jugadores van a estar muy metidos en estos partidos y si no ah estar yo para evitar cualquier relajaci n es el inicio todo resulta complicado y los rivales llegar n m s rodados la experiencia en otras eliminatorias previas nos indica que debemos ir con cuidado

362872 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
362873 we have secured or are in the process of closing over 34 million in financing to help fund our effort to provide broadband and voice services to underserved rural markets in the united states
362874 we tested and compared voxs voip services against the competition and concluded that vox is the best wholesale voip provider in the industry in terms of voice quality provisioning and overall value
362875 we are proud to have charles street partners as one of our wholesale customers they are an excellent testimonial of how our superior voip services are able to cover the largest markets in the united states as well as the underserved rural areas our unique voip technology coupled with high profile service providers like csp enables us to strengthen our presence in the larger metropolitan markets while simultaneously enabling us to gain first mover advantage in some of the most underserved rural markets in the country
362876 guess what neil what goes around lays eggs around because that same biologist jason bond is naming a spider after me
362877 and all i had to do was shamelessly beg on national television
362878 watch out neil when they say my spider eats its young they are talking about you
362879 its a great opportunity for people to connect with it i think many people are surprised that there are new species
362880 the stuff that makes the world go round are all the small things
362881 not only is this my mothers death warrant but theyre asking
362882 resilience in the face of a merciless and arbitrary fate
362883 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
362884 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
362885 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
362886 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
362887 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
362888 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
362889 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
362890 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
362891 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
362892 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
362893 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
362894 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
362895 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
362896 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
362897 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
362898 because the species is considered similar to the ancient ancestors of all primates its 55 million year bender suggests that our own taste for alcohol might predate the known advent of brewing some 9 000 years ago
362899 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
362900 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
362901 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
362902 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
362903 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
362904 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
362905 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
362906 who are open to doing something on the production side
362907 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
362908 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
362909 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
362910 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
362911 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
362912 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
362913 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
362914 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
362915 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
362916 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
362917 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
362918 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
362919 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
362920 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
362921 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
362922 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
362923 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
362924 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
362925 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
362926 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
362927 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
362928 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
362929 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
362930 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
362931 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
362932 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
362933 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
362934 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
362935 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
362936 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
362937 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
362938 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
362939 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
362940 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
362941 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
362942 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
362943 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
362944 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
362945 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
362946 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
362947 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
362948 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
362949 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
362950 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
362951 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
362952 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
362953 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
362954 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
362955 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
362956 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
362957 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
362958 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
362959 working with lindsay is an interesting proposition ive always been a big fan and i think shes cool ive never met sam ronson but i have met her dad and her sister charlotte when i was working with mark at coachella they are a great family ill be heading over to l a and new york in a couple of weeks to start writing for lindsay and a few other artists im really excited
362960 she did a ridiculously fabulous job on the track bossy i was so shocked i had to call her and apologize for what i was thinking because she did so good i think the world is gonna be surprised

363045 i must say youve been a lot more confident tonight than whenever i had seen you before
363046 it is our understanding that there are discussions ongoing within law enforcement as to whether the fbi will become involved
363047 only in the last week or so have we confirmed that in fact there are no tickets coming through
363048 we have seen no evidence that anyone has received any tickets the best that we can tell its blatant fraud
363049 i actually tried to expose them way back in february to newspapers and also to the beijing olympics committee
363050 it seems like no one took it seriously until now
363051 if i failed to recognize this internet scam very few other individuals with less of an e commerce background would have had a chance
363052 so i can empathize with others in the same position
363053 ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there
363054 but they looked so legitimate their website was so elaborate
363055 i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime
363056 so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet
363057 the important point im making by talking about this is that this was a bloody good scam
363058 its like one of those boiler room deals in the stock market the huge office and all these people and at the last second they simply shut it down
363059 be careful when you fight the monsters lest you become one
363060 in terms of foreign policy in the far east it is mistaken if someone were to say that my preoccupation was on the war on terror
363061 you bet i wanted to make sure that we protected ourselves at home
363062 the visionary lies to himself the liar only to others
363063 i wanted to be back with this group of guys and try to win another championship
363064 going to europe is something i always wanted to do
363065 but im happy to be back playing with these guys
363066 theres two reasons players go one is money and two is you want to try and play at the best level of competition you can play
363067 i think thats the biggest thing ive noticed hes filled out a little bit
363068 hes a traitor and he needs to earn his spot back
363069 theyve given me a hard time for sure as i would if any of them did the same
363070 but i think everyone understands i mean when i was growing up mls was really young didnt even exist so going to europe was something i wanted to get a taste of im glad it did it
363071 weve got two more games before the real deal starts
363072 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
363073 attention everyone in the bar please give your thoughts on bud light all together now aaaargh
363074 it is fun im really serious we freestyle rap in a circle
363075 i go insane thats how i handle it i have a few curse words here and there for him and we definitely fight like cat and dog
363076 but at the end of the day he works his butt off and he makes sure im looked after so it comes out to a happy medium
363077 go away you bastards of bastards just bloody well piss off already will you
363078 here you go darling just squirt this up your nose and put any thoughts of drowning over the bathroom sink completely out of your pretty little head
363079 i am still working on my 2009 plans at this time i have no timetable on finalizing anything at this point
363080 dont get too excited just yet dont believe everything you read on the internet there have been some recent articles posted that reporters have put out that sound factual however ryan has not verbally agreed to anything and is still working on his 2009 and future plans it is funny how much speculation has been going on about ryans future everyone will know when the deal is signed sorry to disappoint just dont want anyone to jump to conclusions

363083 in recent weeks thousands of wal mart store managers and department heads have been summoned to mandatory meetings to warn that if democrats win power in november theyll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies including wal mart
363084 there were also reports that some potentially democratic voters were intimidated into voting for mckinley for example some factory owners posted signs the day before the election announcing that if bryan won the election the factory would be closed and the workers would lose their jobs
363085 i talked to my sister in law and she had talked to my aunt and said his grandfather probably wants you to just go out there and play golf but i do feel like i have something on my shoulder i know hes definitely watching me so he has the best seat in the house
363086 you always want to be around the lead thats why you practice
363087 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
363088 citigroup represented that auction rate securities were safe liquid and cash equivalent securities
363089 these representations were false and had a severe detrimental impact on tens of thousands of citigroup customers
363090 as soon as we learned of the oversight we immediately suspended all recycling of tapes and preserved all existing tapes
363091 we reported this oversight to the regulators and we have fully cooperated with them in all aspects of this investigation
363092 we basically got opposite answers when we should have gotten the same answer
363093 what weve shown is if you use more than one model you can get entirely different results so based on studies that used only one model maybe we have no view at all of what the impacts are going to be
363094 that was worrying as a biologist engaged in the business of trying to elucidate biological impacts
363095 what we need is a whole array of models that all make different assumptions and then we look for conclusions that are reasonably robust
363096 i certainly would hope that the study spurs more research like weve been doing in our lab
363097 from impacts to adaptation canada in a changing climate 2007
363098 if theres a lesson to be learned based on this article that would be to use a wide range of models and a wide range of scenarios fair enough i dont know how you could try to refute that
363099 its our job to look at the literature with a critical eye a welcome thought and get a sense of what were they really using and what were they really saying its really up to the scientists to determine what are the most plausible outcomes where can we make from a precautionary principle perspective the most intelligent decisions
363100 failed to include an examination of whether the operation will contribute to global warming through the production of plastic bottles the operations electrical demands and the diesel soot and greenhouse gas emissions produced by trucks traveling to and from the plant
363101 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
363102 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
363103 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
363104 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
363105 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
363106 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

363108 frankly there was a lot of dispute at the time it was granted to them
363109 circumstances have changed with oil at these levels we dont think that manufacturers credit is necessary to encourage them to explore and produce oil and gas
363110 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
363111 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
363112 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore
363113 its only a logical extension of whats happening in the gulf right now plus that area has been identified as an area where resources are available right now
363114 if anybody wants to drill off florida theyll have a fight on their hands
363115 unfortunately the proposal would eliminate floridas 2006 gulf protections and give floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur
363116 it doesnt make a whole lot of sense just to open everything up right now and think that were going to have a rush by the folks who do the exploration to go all over america
363117 take a look at it and see if theres aspects of it that we could embrace
363118 when we come back we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
363119 were happy to provide our positions via our web site and conversations with individuals and groups

363123 in the past five years a secondary market has developed in credit card debt that mirrors the one in the mortgage market theres been a growth in brokers resellers and people getting into the business including lawyers
363124 there are already more lawsuits filed by people who dont own the debt
363125 theres more money in suing businesses over debt than consumers
363126 the sheriff can go out and pick up a bulldozer
363127 well have to see what this economy does theres a lag time to these things
363128 what companies used to let slide now more and more debt collectors are buying the permission and ability to go after the money and are getting more aggressive
363129 in the late 80s and early 90s when there were regional and small state banks failing collection rates skyrocketed and they were throwing collection work at lawyers
363130 were getting ready to gear up again paper could be flooding the street
363131 but if you think about it without collections nobody else gets anything done
363132 its important for internet users and american consumers in general to understand what information is being collected about them and how its being used
363133 we have cars that get an average 22 miles per gallon we could have had cars that get 40 by now
363134 we might have done better if high mileage pollution free vehicles weve been working so hard to develop had arrived in significant numbers
363135 we used to try to work with washington to no avail
363136 with energy demand continuing to grow prices breaking records and concern about climate change intensifying we need policies that bring sustainable solutions
363137 the energy challenges we face in terms of energy security and climate change are global and call for a global response
363138 sustainability will be one of our most serious problems energy is part of it the global climate is part of it we need to do solar and wind but theyre not enough now weve got 6 5 billion people in 2050 well have another 3 billion if you cant make it work now youve got more wars more poverty and everything you can think of

363141 olis does not point to any evidence showing that any of the courts prior rulings in this case are based on an extrajudicial source or that they exhibit the degree of favoritism or antagonism required to warrant recusal
363142 we believe the employee free choice act is a bad bill and we have been on the record as opposed to it
363143 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression they are wrong and acting without approval
363144 half of our political action committee contributions are to members of each party
363145 we regularly educate our associates on issues which impact our company and this is an example of that
363146 a years long surveillance operation that the company has used to intercept and pass along secret messages videos and advance warnings of suicide bombings from the terrorist groups communications network

363158 the bush administration has spent heavily on the wars in iraq and afghanistan and faces a large budget shortfall in tax revenue because of bushs tax cuts and a souring economy

363203 there is a limit to what we can do in pakistan
363204 the fact that were reduced to trying to send messages to the pakistanis by putting stories in newspapers tells you we dont have any good options
363205 it also suggests that the high level face to face contacts havent worked so far the trouble is these kinds of public threats are likely to backfire
363206 one thing we never understood is that india has always been the major threat for pakistan
363207 pakistan over the last several years has increasingly come to believe that it is being encircled by india and a u s india afghan axis
363208 we have created a set of perverse incentives for the pakistanis to continue their support for the taliban
363209 pakistan does not view the united states as a long term player in the region and certainly doesnt view pakistans strategic interests as congruent with ours and that divergence is getting larger not smaller
363210 there is good evidence that elements of the isi have re engaged with the taliban

363284 after carefully considering recent crop reports and weather conditions the price trends we are seeing in grain markets and the likelihood of increasing land for crop production we have decided not to allow the penalty free release of crp land at this time even with the damage and delays in planting caused by the floods this years corn crop is on track to be the second largest on record with an anticipated harvest of almost 79 million acres in the 2008 farm bill congress lowered the cap on the total number of acres allowed in the crp program from 39 2 million acres to 32 million acres as a result the 34 7 million acres now enrolled in the program will have to shrink and looking out over the next few years we have 1 1 million crp acres scheduled to expire on september 30th of this year and that number jumps to 3 8 million acres on september 30 2009 and then 4 4 million acres on september 30 2010 the action we took in may to allow haying and foraging on up to 24 million crp acres this year after the primary nesting season ends provided contract holders with another choice for managing their lands and feeding livestock we believe the decision we are announcing strikes the best possible balance between supporting programs that protect our natural resources and meeting the nations need for grain production

363295 at no time during the conversation did i threaten mr schultz in any way either expressly or implicitly regarding his continuation of this lawsuit or any other matter

363305 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
363306 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore
363307 its only a logical extension of whats happening in the gulf right now plus that area has been identified as an area where resources are available right now
363308 if anybody wants to drill off florida theyll have a fight on their hands
363309 unfortunately the proposal would eliminate floridas 2006 gulf protections and give floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur
363310 it doesnt make a whole lot of sense just to open everything up right now and think that were going to have a rush by the folks who do the exploration to go all over america
363311 take a look at it and see if theres aspects of it that we could embrace
363312 when we come back we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
363313 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
363314 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
363315 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
363316 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
363317 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
363318 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
363319 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
363320 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
363321 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
363322 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
363323 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
363324 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
363325 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
363326 i think youre overpaid on compensation and youve overstayed your welcome
363327 will you do the honorable thing if theres a high against vote and step down from this board
363328 they said to one of our management people there may be a few more dollars on the table
363329 there was some things going on with the team that were real and not just imagined
363330 there was a dynamic that had been created that made it more difficult for us to go play at our best and for players to perform
363331 i think it put us in a good position going forward from a baseball standpoint and from the standpoint of standing for something as an organization i think the team comes first
363332 we just had a meeting theres 25 guys down there that now feel like a team and it hasnt felt like that for a while and you have to feel like that in professional sports to perform at your best
363333 it didnt seem like we were handling the challenge up to what we were needing to
363334 there was a lot of doubt there were different versions of the deal that died and this particular version didnt truly get resuscitated until a couple of minutes before the deadline
363335 we have the best run differential in the american league and i think we have a chance to be the best club in the american league
363336 we lost one of the best hitters in probably the history of baseball but we gained a really good baseball player who can help us win so i dont think we have to catch lightning in a bottle
363337 we have to get back to being a team and go out and perform up to our expectations
363338 could a british actor wear the red horns of the man without fear absolutely just give me the chance i would love to be daredevil
363339 members of congress visiting in personal or semi personal capacities

363343 pokoknya sesat kata murobbiku gerakan yang kamu ikuti itu sesat
363344 mestinya juga ditambahkan setiap harinya di as selalu ada warga negara amerika yang memeluk islam
363345 seperti kita tahu sejak 60 tahun yang lalu amerika membutuhkan banyak insinyur dokter dan tenaga profesional lainnya banyak dari mereka berasal dari asia timur tengah dan afrika dan muslim
363346 karena itu tak sedikit di antara mereka yang hadir kali ini ke indonesia awalnya adalah orang orang keturunan dari berbagai bangsa di india pakistan dan beberapa negara lain
363347 jadi umat islam di amerika memiliki potensi dan kemampuan beragam dan kini mereka bergabung dalam sebuah lembaga pendidikan nawawi fondation
363348 kami ajak mereka ke sini agar nantinya mereka bisa menampakkan islam di tengah tengah msyarakat amerika
363349 alhamdulillah kebaikan masih tetap ada di as allah memberi petunjuk kepada siapa saja yang dia kehendaki atas izin allah alhamdulillah banyak yang dibukakan pintu hatinya
363350 islam yang membawa kecintaan dan perdamaian islam yang membawa rahmat bagi semua alam
363351 bahkan hingga umat islam dalam kondisi yang teramat buruk tapi semata mata karena keutamaan dan kelebihan islam maka islam berkembang di amerika
363352 kami ingin mendapatkan informasi lebih mendalam tentang perjuangan tokoh tokoh islam di jawa seperti yang dilakukan wali songo
363353 islam sangat berdampak positif di sini dan jumlah penganutnya kian bertambah
363354 islam memang baru di sini tapi dalam lima tahun ini kami sudah mengislamkan 20 ribu jiwa
363355 islam adalah agama yang logis pesan damai yang dibawa islam juga gampang diterima
363356 biarkan anak muda membaca banyak kitab suci berbagai macam agama dengan sendirinya nanti hati mereka tertambat pada islam
363357 ketika kita sudah bersyahadat maka kita adalah saudara tidak ada kasta
363358 islam itu toleran ini pula yang membaut orang tua saya tidak mempermasalahkan ketika saya memutuskan untuk berislam
363359 dia tak membayangkan islam bisa mengubah seseorang menjadi sosok yang beda
363360 kini saya tidak merokok tidak minum minum dan tidak lagi menjadi biang kerok
363361 kata sipir narapidana yang menjadi mualaf menjadi orang yang lebih baik dan tenang
363362 tapi pancaran di wajahnya sungguh sungguh membuat saya ingin mengenalnya lebih jauh
363363 beberapa kali datang saya tertarik untuk masuk islam dan waktu kemudian membuktikan saya tidak salah pilih
363364 sains modern membuktikan halal dan higienis adalah dua hal penting bagi kesehatan
363365 saya anak indonesia sejati mandiri dan kreatif anak indonesia sejahtera berkualitas dan terlindungi
363366 sayangnya saya bukan anak anak lagi jadi tidak ada yng membri selamat hiks
363367 kita tidak bisa menyangkal usaha untuk menyebar islam di barat dan kami juga tidak memahami dan tidak membiarkan ini membutakan kita menjadi ancaman identitas europa
363368 sementara orang kristen menaruh hormat terhadap islam dan berhasrat melakukan dialog dengan orang muslim
363369 anda mungkin tidak pernah mendapat pandangan kebencian seperti yang saya alami anda mungkin tidak pernah melihat pandangan kebencian itu karena wajah anda atau penampilan anda pandangan itu bisa menghilangklan semangat dan lebih menyakitkan dibandingkan dengan dipukul dengan kayu
363370 semua yang terlibat dalam serangan tanggal 11 september yang merupakan kejahatan menggemparkan itu tidak ada yang berkewarganegaraan amerika tidak seorangpun dan di sini kami warga amerika menjadi sasaran diperlakukan dengan tidak adil dari seharusnya bekerjasama menjadi sekutu membersihkan unsur unsur yang sesat kita malah menciptakan hubungan yang bermusuhan
363371 kami tidak pernah tahu lingkup tindakan diskriminasi yang telah berjalan sejak tanggal 11 september kebanyakan orang tidak mau tampil karena mereka tidak ingin membuat heboh mereka tidak mau disorot dan menjadi pusat perhatian mereka tidak mau dimintai keterangan mengenai sudah berapa lama mereka berada di amerika dari negara mana mereka berasal
363372 kalau mereka ingin menciptakan persahabatan mereka harus bersedia mencoba menjalin persahabatan maksud saya mereka harus mulai melakukan kegiatan yang memungkinkan orang saling mengenal satu sama lain kami tidak mengenal mereka dan kalau mereka tidak memulainya sekarang mereka akan mendapati diri mereka terkatung katung sendiri
363373 badan ini tidak memiliki wewenang dan sangat jelas bahwa departemen kehakiman mempunyai peranan dalam menjamin bahwa tidak ada diskriminasi terhadap kamsyarakat muslim
363374 sie ist falsch und muss aus meiner sicht aus der welt geschafft werden
363375 ein derartiges vorgehen ffnet der willk r t r und tor
363376 der versuch die agenda 2010 zur ckzudrehen ist grundfalsch es falsch f r das land es ist falsch f r die spd und darum streiten wir
363377 wenn es dabei bleibt wird das f r die spd heftige folgen haben dann werden sich die mitgliederverluste beschleunigen
363378 aber wenn man das will in der spd dann m ssen sie auch mich ausschlie en gerhard schr der frank walter steinmeier ulla schmidt also das ganze kabinett
363379 census data should reflect the reality that these marriages have happened theyre real theyre legal
363380 counting same sex married couples is hardly providing any federal recognition of them other than recognizing thats how they filled out a form
363381 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
363382 we were going to have a surgical team on site because he was adhered to the metal surfaces on top of that pole
363383 he might have to do that right now we dont have the same matchup i dont think either guys going to factor in
363384 no i think were going to try to keep it to just blocking and tackling
363385 this is a time where a guy like quinton culberson starts to kind of catch the eye
363386 initially in camp we knew a little bit about him and he was doing some really good things when we got in the scrimmage and started getting ready for the preseason games thats when culberson just all of a sudden comes out of nowhere thats what youd like to see
363387 it was my first contact my first like real live kind of action in the nfl
363388 it was a little nerve wracking at first you didnt know what to expect how hard the guys hit you get to the league and everybody knows all the little tricks and stuff like that
363389 im in a dogfight trying to make this team so i know that along with making those big catches ive got to show consistency
363390 always lining up right always doing the correct technique and the correct assignment and always giving 100 percent effort
363391 i know the coaches have said good things so far but im not guaranteed anything
363392 im definitely looking forward to getting out there and playing some live football this practice routine is sometimes a little unrealistic tagging off or thudding them up im excited to go out there full speed fly around and hope to make some plays
363393 im happy for isaac but now ive moved on to the 2008 rams
363394 we have more young receivers that were going to be counting on and so you really want to see that
363395 but i have to work with the guys that we have and were going to go out and give it the best that weve got
363396 hes been in excruciating pain for the last 10 days
363397 i think for our own benefit its going to make it a little easier to answer some of these questions once we are briefed by our medical staff but you have to be concerned
363398 did we know he could have surgery the answer is yes
363399 any time you discuss a injury with a player you understand what the best case and the worse case would be
363400 hes dealt with a lot of pain this season and hes played when he hasnt felt right
363401 hes caught a lot of heat from people for that and these are the same people who show others lots of patience i have a problem with that
363402 given they are trying to do this quickly it would be easy to assume the significance of it
363403 hes important to us hes important to the ballclub for him to get that first one out of the way i think is a step forward
363404 ive got to keep going out there and getting the job done or i wont be in that role i realize that i have to realize that it could be on borrowed time
363405 the quality of the opponent the importance of the game and at home where fans are waiting to see how he does before they give him their tender love and care it was huge
363406 look at it personally it was important for izzy too whats important for izzy is important for us
363407 innings face one hitter face a couple hitters a couple innings
363408 the guy should have a better record than he has
363409 but were 8 10 in his starts somehow so the guys dont have a bad vibe when he goes out there he gets distracted the big point getting distracted by anything that doesnt help
363410 running routes isnt one of my great abilities but i have a desire to work at it and i feel like i can catch the ball somewhat
363411 whatever they want me to do ill try to do it
363412 they wanted to go more two tight ends and open it up a little bit more than they had in the past
363413 i guess thats just kind of the way the nfl evolves youve got a lot of good skill position guys in the league and a lot of good quarterbacks you want to tailor your offense to those types of players because theyre explosive and make things happen
363414 but youve still got to be able to run the ball
363415 through the course of his career dans shown that lead blocking ability thats what he does
363416 and as limited the amount of times they threw the ball to him hes got exceptional hands
363417 he played in a different system in pittsburgh his whole career but hes a professional that guy is all business i think he can really help us
363418 in this business its all about if they have confidence in what youre doing
363419 my goal is to be able to learn as quickly as i can so that they can feel confident putting me in when they need to
363420 book each of kfns daytime weekday shows fell at least 23 percent
363421 we are again growing and we expect to be back to where we were in the next ratings book crocker said
363422 if youre a manager of any kind of business in america and made a bone headed decision like that resulting in such a big drop youd be fired said slaten who is suing the station for wrongful termination
363423 we all know why it was to dump money but i guess dumping money has really hurt them listeners know whats going on more than what management does at 590 from the top down theres nothing but blubbering incompetence
363424 but to factor in the massive turnover you can understand how the first couple months could be rough but dont get me wrong 1380s got a nice team
363425 if you could have told me a year ago when i got here that wed be tied with kfns id be ecstatic he said
363426 theyve been here a long time and with a stronghold on the market how can you not be happy with that after less than a year since we went all local
363427 morning after with tim mckernan jim hayes and doug vaughn fell 30 percent
363428 all those people who listened to sports radio just vanished into the air
363429 we know people are listening clients are coming on board every day
363430 thats where the money is in sports talk radio because those rates are the highest he said
363431 i have a very difficult time leaving the studio to go to the rest room because i have to do commercials during every break thats what it comes down to are you making money for your station
363432 since there is no declaration of election postponement international observers speculated that the election will be conducted in due time and in a peaceful manner
363433 when there are people observing what you are doing you are always on your toes especially foreign observers at that it is a reflection of how well we are doing in our elections exercise if we do it correctly we will get a free ride in the media we can learn also from them they can tell us how elections are held in other places theyve observed
363434 insofar as we are concerned there is no postponement we cannot postpone we will go on with the exercise even if its postponed to test the system
363435 from a logistical point of view this is easier for us we did it before in armm
363436 but its different now because the election is automated and the national situation is uncertain these are the complicating factors
363437 as indonesian id like to learn and recommend to m government to automate our elections
363438 the team aims to study the development of the system and the actual practice that could be different from the general elections conducted in armm last year
363439 the kidnapping of prof dinampo really scared them this is a sensitive situation and a sensitive area for us to observe
363440 i dont want to scare you too much i myself i am afraid sometimes its unpredictable you may not have problems at all
363441 the local situation is not so good they worry that if they come they cant go back
363442 they will be briefed about these they are not advised to go to the hot hot areas
363443 its not particularly dangerous there theres always a level of tension that youd expect n an area like that but everything seems to be quiet but we still want to be careful youll have to exercise a lot of sound judgment
363444 we dont want to be accompanied by soldiers we want to appear impartial to maximize our work in the ground
363445 we dont ask them to go to dangerous places it also helps that they are asian observers
363446 they dont look too different from filipinos and they wont attract too much attention
363447 our role is different from journalists who want to take a good picture of dangerous incidents this is not our role
363448 we wish this wasnt the big issue because there are bigger ones but we cant now avoid it
363449 confidence in the validity of the anglican communion is severely damaged
363450 bishops cannot be a symbol of unity when their consecration itself divided the church
363451 rush limbaugh will surely receive lots of tributes on his 20th anniversary but none will be more sincere than the liberal effort to put him out of business

363468 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead and we are talking about attacks like the sub prime mortgage that you spoke of it wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomena a phenomena that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and right here in st petersburg by the st petersburg police and jena 6 and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
363469 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead and we are talking about attacks like the sub prime mortgage that you spoke of

363567 its one of those tournaments where you dont think how young how old you are you just kind of manage to get through those conditions
363568 i was very unhappy to miss the cut but seeing the weather on saturday and sunday i thought i did a great move
363569 i talked to a lot of senior golfers that were at tpc that week and they were all excited about it
363570 they said it gives all the guys hope that they can go out there and still do it
363571 i will go to north finland to see my parents do a little bit of fishing walking in the forest enjoying not seeing anyone else
363572 i will see some animals reindeer maybe bears things like that
363573 in my family i make the decisions where i go i dont know what my girlfriend will do but it is my holiday
363574 this is a team order in my team and im in a strong position this time
363575 if its time to join the club i will join if she says no then i wont join
363576 if they ask me to join the club ill make my decision whether my girlfriend is happy or not
363577 i try to keep it that way i think its better
363578 first of all i dont think lewis needs any help
363579 he has shown himself he can do the job and he doesnt need anyone there
363580 the second point is i am trying to do the maximum for myself and i am not helping any other drivers thats for sure
363581 i have no instructions from the team in the past it has been very clear at mclaren they have had the policy of equal drivers and both have the same opportunities
363582 i have the same car the same opportunity and i am working towards improving the pace and the results
363583 the last few races have been a little disappointing but the only way to move on is to keep working hard and eventually the results will come
363584 physically once i started to warm up i felt really fine and thought i was moving really well at the end of the match
363585 i warmed up well got up early to make sure i was hydrated and in the best possible physical condition but i just didnt get going
363586 im not sure what happened and ill try to make sure it doesnt happen again
363587 hes tough wherever you play him it doesnt matter hes sometimes had some better results on the slightly slower courts
363588 he struggled a lot at wimbledon because he doesnt return so well
363589 our main rivals seem to still be a little quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads
363590 there is still room for improvement and we will concentrate all our efforts on this in preparing for qualifying and the race
363591 of course its not nice when its not going so well but its not the first time
363592 we will just keep pushing and at some point things will start to improve
363593 they mclaren have been very fast in the last races and we have not exactly been doing so well
363594 there are many races to go and he hamilton has a little gap over us so its not easy to catch up
363595 if we dont start winning it will be pretty difficult hopefully we can catch up
363596 it would be so easy to say that just because they won the last two races they are the kings
363597 before the last two races they were not the kings so we know how this sport works
363598 weve just passed the halfway point of the championship so there is still a long way to go
363599 we have a good team were ahead in the constructors championship and second and third in the drivers championships
363600 we are not far behind we are very close and we all know in f1 things can change very easily
363601 we are 100 motivated to be competitive here and not just here but through to the end of the season
363602 ive gone to a more traditional shaped one i think that will be a little bit easier to use on these fast greens it comes off it a little bit softer
363603 its a lot easier to putt here than i thought at birkdale obviously at birkdale the wind was blowing and the greens were a lot slower
363604 if i was going to set up greens to not suit me thats exactly how i would have set them up
363605 im much happier on quicker greens where i can use a shorter stroke and keep it nice and slow and smooth
363606 its all about getting my chipping right out of the rough going to do a bit of practise on that and just getting myself into the mindset for next week
363607 so im happy about having another two rounds opportunities for that but as far as that im not going to overdo things theres no question im suffering a bit with fatigue
363608 i thought that i was serving much better and day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
363609 well i mean of course in a tiebreak its most important to serve well and to use your chances
363610 i was playing well actually this week so im happy about that
363611 it was important because i felt like i can win that i have my chances but i was trying not to put pressure on myself after yesterdays win
363612 i mean to go two breaks down a set and two breaks down would have been tough to come back from
363613 but you know it happens sometimes in tennis when youre feeling confident and you know your opponent hasnt maybe played as well as he can throughout the year

363653 he is not at the end of his career he is in the middle of his career and i believe it is a good opportunity for him to show his quality
363654 i remember when i started now i look at the people who were around me then and there are not many who have survived because you go through difficult periods but the strong ones survive so he is at the period where he will show that he can bounce back and show his quality
363655 yes you become a different person out of your country it makes you a different person and it makes you stronger as well
363656 its unfair criticism but unfair criticism stops quickly if you get good results
363657 i think that kind of opinion changes quickly it the euro 2008 qualifying debacle was a big disappointment in the country then he got a lot of hard criticism in england and some managers have problems recovering from that i have seen many national team managers who struggled after because mentally it is quite hard to take
363658 it will be important for us to be at the top of our concentration to go through
363659 we are playing the first game away from home we know we are a wanted target and we want to go to the first game with a top level concentration

363661 the number of people coming here for free meals has more than doubled in recent months so tremendous has been the price hike

363671 minimum drag speed vmd is defined as the speed at which aircraft total drag is at a minimum requiring minimum thrust for level flight this speed is associated with the endurance speed at a constant altitude progressive reduction in true airspeed below vmd results in a concomitant increase in total drag which results in a further deterioration of airspeed therefore airspeed values below vmd can result in negative stability see figure 1 should cruise airspeed become less than vmd speed restoration can be accomplished by increasing engine power by initiating a descent or a combination of both the power required to maintain vmd increases as altitude and or aircraft weight increases at high altitudes the power required to maintain vmd may be only marginally lower than that required for cruise delaying a descent in favour of applying power may result in the aircraft speed decelerating to the point of stick shaker activation and disengagement of the autopilot data supplied by bombardier aerospace indicated that under the conditions jza8105 was operating at the time of the occurrence vmd was 0 75m which was near the cruise speed of 0 77m in the crj200 vmd was below the published long range cruise speed under all normal flight conditions whereas in the crj705 under certain altitudes and aircraft weights vmd could be above the long range cruise speed

363693 the mccain strategy requires an odd sweet spot to succeed iraq must be neither stable enough to make american withdrawal a conceivable possibility nor bloody enough to make american retreat a public priority
363694 i dont think im miss congeniality with the mccain campaign but its an awful campaign im not afraid to say it on television because its the truth i was critical of the campaign before they decided i was poison
363695 its kind of like being a hired killer i guess i can go back to it

363720 wir haben den geilsten job der welt das ist so ein jungs ding diese absurden wettk mpfe das hat ein bisschen was von schwanzvergleich
363721 ich f hle mich auf jeden fall noch nicht wie 32 und ich werde meistens auf anfang bis mitte 20 gesch tzt
363722 bhs und liebesbriefe werden mir leider von meinem management nicht weitegeleitet und wenn mich frauen auf der stra e erkennen wollen mir alle in den bauch pieken aber das ist doch besser als gar kein k rperkontakt oder
363723 bei der kussszene mit angelina jolie war ich echt nerv s
363724 als ernsthafter schauspieler anerkannt werden wie zum beispiel matt damon
363725 ich lade dauernd leute zu mir nach hause ein und dann frage ich mich immer wieder was ich mir da angetan habe dann bin ich ein bisschen geh ssig bis sie endlich wieder gehen
363726 in los angeles wo wir leben herrscht immer brandgefahr da muss man h llisch aufpassen letzte woche hat es in meinem haus gebrannt meine tochter konnte das feuer l schen aber sie hatte es auch verursacht kerzen waren schuld
363727 das wichtigste an einer m nnerfreundschaft ist dass man sich auf seinen freund hundertprozentig verlassen kann dass man wei dass er ehrlich zu einem ist und dass er immer f r einen da ist wenn man ihn braucht und umgekehrt
363728 ich hab ein bisschen platzangst auf so schiffen wenn es dann weggeht und tagelang und ich hab nur noch irgendwie meine mitmenschen jetzt in diesem fall sind es ja 1200 das w re mir alles ein bisschen zuviel und zu eng
363729 mode ist mir pers nlich nicht allzu wichtig ich ziehe mich gerne bequem an am liebsten jeans und t shirts und wenn es ein tolles produkt ist wie zum beispiel die sachen von philipp also bequem und ansehnlich dann ist es eine besondere zugabe
363730 weil man sich mit mode einfach auch positionieren kann und man kann mit hilfe von mode einfach zeigen ich stehe hier oder ich bin so oder heute f hle ich mich schwarz oder heute f hle ich mich gelb irgendwie so und das finde ich ist ein mittel zu dem man immer greifen sollte man muss es nicht bertreiben also wenn man nur dar ber quatscht also ich finde man sollte sich im griff haben wie viel rede ich dar ber und wie viel anteil an meinem leben hat das aber ich finde es schon wichtig
363731 i immediately knew it was a mistake because it was a check for 60 000

363735 the role of women in the brazilian culture or economy has evolved
363736 if you think of the u s 20 years ago i think this is happening now in brazil in this case women rethink their role
363737 as a result of jessica hardys withdrawal from the u s olympic team usa swimming will follow the published u s olympic team selection procedures
363738 according to the pre approved procedures swimmers from the existing roster will be placed in the open events kara lynn joyce will swim the 50m freestyle
363739 this is the best chance for me and also for my team mates to win a gold medal i am in very good form right now
363740 all of us will be in top gear coming into the olympic games
363741 but i think the most important thing is to play the game well win and win over the fans with victory
363742 its disappointing i am bemused why there is this rush to get rid of it in fact the opposite should be happening we should be trying to build it up
363743 they wanted to have the same opportunity to take part in the qualifiers as the other counties which is understandable
363744 that didnt mean that the tommy murphy cup would have to be sacrificed it is a question of sitting down with these counties and working out the best way forward rather than waiting for them to put a motion to congress
363745 this was a reaction to what happened last year which isnt always the best way to do business
363746 oh look the cliffs are all dirty the birds have dirtied them
363747 the three workers quickly managed to operate their industrial cherry picker towards the stricken man
363748 the tide was rapidly coming in and the man was in danger of drowning the workers managed to reach the man and hold his head above water
363749 once firefighters arrived they reached the man via a ladder washed the mud off his face and placed breathing apparatus on to the mans face in case the water came over into his mouth
363750 the man was incredibly lucky that workers on the quayside had seen him in the mud
363751 its thanks to the quick thinking of the workers who came to his rescue as soon as they saw him in danger that he survived
363752 incidents like this are few and far between it is an unnerving thing to happen but it is also an isolated incident
363753 the police are out here patrolling more than ever and i really believe st olaves is a nice place to live this type of incident is few and far between and we have all really built up a strong community spirit around here
363754 we have launched this campaign because we want everybody within our community to enjoy the summer break without it being disrupted by drunken behaviour
363755 we are not being killjoys we are just trying to encourage the public to enjoy themselves but to drink in moderation and not spoil nights out for others
363756 it is time for the entire community to pull in the same direction and aim for a safer tendring we will not tolerate excessive drinking that then adversely affects others suffolk homes
363757 there is a room for teenagers at the hospice in julies memory which is especially equipped and what we are trying to do is provide funds to maintain that room
363758 art was one of julies great loves and young people was another so this is the prefect project
363759 we are really hopeful that people will be inspired by the idea and get the paintbrushes out and we really want to put together some terrific art
363760 this is a wonderful idea with the money going towards the young peoples room in the hospice and i really hope people get on board with it
363761 it is an extremely important room as it was especially set up for youngsters and is a place where they can play their music loud they can plug in their laptops and there is a widescreen television
363762 elliot is the same tissue type but not the right blood type
363763 i wanted to do it because i knew that elliot was having a tough time having kidney failure is worse than simply being plugged in for dialysis a few times a week he hadnt urinated for four and a half years
363764 now it is over is absolutely brilliant i have no side effects and he is running about it is wonderful i cant thank the doctors enough they have been amazing
363765 i felt pretty low i thought my life was on hold but now i am planning to go travelling to see the world and a few more ipswich town matches
363766 my dad is very caring he did all the running about to set up the appointments at addenbrookes he said he would have done it even if the chances had been 50 50
363767 i dont understand how it works i knew it was riskier than a regular transplant but i feel 100 better now
363768 it was hard to see them both go of together like that
363769 i wondered if they were going to come back but when they did eight hours later it was brilliant suffolk homes
363770 i think everyone is saying i am mad the first raleigh runabout moped was produced in 1958 and so this year is its 50th anniversary
363771 i really wanted to do the run on my oldest bike the 1959 model but it didnt pass its mot so i am having to do it on the 1965 model
363772 i have got a few bikes not sure i want to admit exactly how many but its about six plus
363773 this journey is about 900 miles and so is the furthest distance i have ever tried without suspension it will be as much a test for me as the bike
363774 i have never done the run before and i am really looking forward to it the nacc decided to organise the trip and i decided it was a great opportunity to raise funds for the three charities
363775 i used to be involved with the small inflatable inshore life boats i was on of the launchers never part of the crew because i wore glasses
363776 all of the charities do such a good job to me the three charities need supporting as much as possible
363777 everybody who is sponsoring me has the choice of donating their money to all of the charities or just one
363778 he was so kind he would help anybody whether they were strangers or not everybody who met him was touched by him
363779 it has left such a huge hole everybody left will miss him
363780 martyn returned to sudbury many times and always felt that sudbury was his home
363781 in april this year his dad martyn had a serious operation on his shoulder which left him physically unable to carry out his family business of tyre fitting
363782 typically martyn junior did not hesitate to come home and help his dad run the family business something that he had done many times before the transition of martyn senior to martyn junior running the business was seamless customers loved martyn junior in the same way all of his friends did
363783 martyn and lynda are devastated by their loss and are very much taking each hour and day as it comes but they would like to thank the many people that have sent flowers and cards in remembrance to martyn junior and are drawing strength from all of the kind words being written
363784 it is with deep deep regret that we have had to pull our court action as it started to look very unlikely that we would get an indefinite injunction at this stage
363785 the post offices defence regarding closing the crown street branch as opposed to keeping it open included the damage to its business and if we got an injunction then every branch in the land would
363786 this is the end for us and i only hope people start to realise what is happening to our community its heartbreaking for everybody
363787 the support here was phenomenal and i just want to thank everyone for it
363788 i feel numb i thought there was some hope i really did and this has come as quite a shock and i find it very hard
363789 this is a kick in the teeth you do something to the best of your ability and although it is not just happening to me it hurts
363790 i want to thank everybody so much from the bottom of my heart the community is devastated everybody has been crying its heartbreaking there was a glimmer of hope but this is the end of an era now it will never re open
363791 you have more of a sexual problem than you are prepared to admit
363792 it is quite clear you took advantage of this young woman in a disgraceful way you knew perfectly well she could not possibly be consenting to your sexual advances
363793 he has been shunned by his local community and people are shocked by what has taken place
363794 this sentence does not send out the right message it is a very very lenient sentence and downloading images of children we believe is a very very serious offence
363795 it is like a child being abused over and over again and it is creating a market for it which is a big concern
363796 local residents have been told to remain indoors keeping doors and windows closed the electricity is expected to be off for some considerable time
363797 it has been devastating for trade i should imagine i have lost hundreds of pounds today because of this
363798 i and many other businesses in the town will be looking to edf for some form of compensation
363799 we cannot serve anyone because the till does not work and the shop is too dark i should image this has caused quite a lot of people a lot of inconvenience
363800 i should image that anyone with a freezer full of food in this heat is beginning to worry
363801 edf energy networks engineers restored power in stages to the majority of customers throughout the morning
363802 we are working as quickly and as safely as possible to restore supplies to the remaining 1 042 customers who are still without power temporary generators are en route to the site in order to restore supplies to these customers throughout this evening
363803 the british red cross are now in the area on our behalf to help give practical support to customers without power they are working from a van which is parked in the library car park
363804 they will have the latest information for customers affected by the power cut on how work is progressing and can provide hot drinks to those who need them
363805 they will also be calling on any vulnerable customers we are aware of we would like to apologise to all of our customers affected by this power cut for the inconvenience caused
363806 the whole world of media communications and advertising are going to be turned upside down
363807 there will be no media consumption left in 10 years that is not delivered over an ip network there will be no newspapers no magazines that are delivered in paper form
363808 consumers dont move that fast there is no question that digital media is exponentially increasing in importance but there are lots of reasons that that statement is not going to prove to be correct largely because theres a whole group of consumers out there who like print media
363809 but that doesnt mean that newspapers dont have to fundamentally rethink their business models because they do
363810 leeched away to websites like craigslist com monster com and autotrader com which are cheaper and more effective than newspaper websites
363811 all of that has created a profit squeeze based on the fact that you still have a lot of the same costs associated with creating a newspaper but youre generating less revenue and fewer readers
363812 and you cant cut costs faster than the drop in revenues
363813 local town newspapers generate a lot of original content like sports stories from the local high school or the police blotter which matters to its readership
363814 it is content thats not available from any other sources those newspapers have made a very successful migration to the web because if youre the local pizza parlour or movie theatre where else are you going to advertise
363815 the bulk of the newspaper industry the large metro dailies like the san francisco chronicle the philadelphia inquirer and the chicago tribune
363816 those papers dont originate enough unique content which matters to a specific audience theyre too big for truly local markets and they dont have enough of a national audience thats where theres huge overcapacity in the industry
363817 have the potential to be newspapers of record on specific topics for specific audiences
363818 for example the wall street journal originates a tremendous amount of financial news and information content and theres no reason why it cant be a us and potentially broader financial information source of record
363819 id argue you could do the same thing with the la times and turn it from an ailing la based newspaper into the entertainment industrys source of record same thing with the washington post as a political rag
363820 so these guys who can stand for something unique because they own a content community and an audience that is in fact in synch that is large enough to give them a decent return on investment for covering that market those guys could have a business model that works
363821 i absolutely see newspapers like the washington post and the wall street journal successfully monetizing their web content because the content domain they cover is global in scope and of importance to a whole bunch of different people
363822 creating the multi platform print mobile online and video distribution of a domain that the newspaper stands for actually has a lot of robustness in it
363823 for example you can create a premium on demand service so that if im a politico it allows me to track the politicians or bills or political news im interested in and serves the stories up to me as theyre developed
363824 and businesses would pay a tremendous amount of money for a service like that
363825 what they wont pay for is generic news which is widely available and free
363826 when we were approached to do a dvd we were sure that we wanted it to be both different and special
363827 by shooting it in ireland and by involving all the musicians i think we certainly achieved that
363828 wed been approached to have our own dvd made on many occasions before and had always refused as cara and i werent keen on the recorded concert format we always wanted to do something a bit different
363829 when robin bextor and steve kersley proper music approached us we initially told them our reservations and then bored them with our dvd pipedreams expecting them to reel in horror at the logistical nightmare and un ending costs but we were shocked when they both looked at each other and said that sounds great lets make it happpen
363830 we assembled our favourite musicians in a converted hospital on the shore of lough foyle in co donegal and filmed for four days recording all the songs in single live takes
363831 we installed all the recording equipment lights and cameras and had four kettles going to make tea for the crew and musicians it was an amazing experience and everyone came away feeling they had been part of something very special indeed when watching it back you really get the feeling of being there amongst cara and the players
363832 this is probably the most talent you will see in a linfield shirt this season
363833 it was a very harsh decision and i sincerely hope phillip is able to bounce back from it
363834 maybe my timing for lurgan park could have been a bit better but the mmsp lancers have nothing to do with the uk rally team it is a completely different operation run by john easton who bought out the assets of the mitsubishi world championship team
363835 it will be the first time for one of these cars in the park so it will be a bit of a learning experience for me and the team
363836 it was after the world championships last year that i really started thinking about the olympics
363837 although olympic qualification was on my mind i never really thought it would be me that eventually goes to the olympics
363838 the olympics has always been a dream since i watched it on television from a very young age but never thought it would happen for me
363839 once i started rowing internationally i set my goals to the highest standard which are the olympics but i always thought it would be london 2012 beijing is a real bonus
363840 robin williams is an ex lightweight himself and he has been through it all before he knows what emotions we go through and how tough life is as an athlete
363841 the training is very demanding and you go through a lot of pain but i think im a bit sadistic because i love going right to the pain threshold taking my body to the extremes i know that if i train that hard then i can expect to do something good
363842 were in a gold medal boat and you know there are people who want to take your place
363843 last year was a tough year because some of us were not getting on that well and were four different individuals so you are going to get that we live together eat so you have to work out how to get on with each other but recently its been great and were focused on our goal
363844 there is only so much you can do on training camp to relax the easiest way to relax is to sleep which i do a lot of i quite like war novels and action films but ill confess that on this camp i have watched the odd chick flick
363845 you get there and you see just how much further you have to go
363846 i started off in the fifth eight and i just worked myself up through the levels
363847 i was just very determined i think im a natural fighter and i love that winning feeling
363848 we may not have got the results we wanted this year but we have been trying out new things and come beijing ive no doubt well be ready
363849 were going there with the intention of bringing home the gold medal everything has to come together the mental the physical and the technique and if we get it right we can win
363850 reeve works hardest on his short game fitness and course management and its paying off
363851 a win in the faldo series at ballyliffin was just what the doctor ordered and hell be going to brazil in october for the world finals a real shot in the arm for any 16 year old
363852 at 7 180 yards and off the tiger tees the course will be a new and exciting experience for all bar young whitson
363853 ireland have only won this series twice in over 20 years but must be well fancied after finishing runners up two seasons running their first hurdle is scotland on tuesday
363854 we have beaten two top ulster teams and now were facing the all ireland champions the qualifiers is certainly a very demanding route
363855 hes very much a top of the ground horse and im not so sure whether he will be effective on soft ground
363856 weve had a lot of rain here during the week but hopefully tony feels that leg spinner will do us justice
363857 we assumed that our quarter final would be in croke park so it has come as a real shock to hear that it might not be there
363858 mentally im totally committed you have to love the sport and if you didnt then you wouldnt do it for all the money in the world ive given up a career missed weddings missed parties just been very self centred and not a nice person to be around at times
363859 its pretty hard for my girlfriend because im away for weeks and i train seven days a week im up at 6am every morning no lie ins and if she wants to see me she has to come to me its very romantic isnt it
363860 when i do make the effort to make time i have to work out how much time it will take up how it might effect my training that probably sounds calculated but i have to do that because im immersed in this lifestyle 100 per cent
363861 i went to wellbeck college for sixth form did my a levels and then got accepted for sandhurst i went to the royal military college of science at shrivenham and did a software engineering degree and i wouldnt recommend it
363862 i was rowing with the army eight training at the boat club in london and thats when i met bill barry when we met he asked me what did i want to do and i said quite cockily and looking to catch him off guard that i wanted a gold medal in 2008 in the single sculls
363863 he said right well youll have to lose 10kg leave the army and learn to be much faster in your starts he was deadly serious and so was i so i left the army quit my degree and decided to give rowing 100 per cent
363864 it was a big decision and a surprise to my mum and dad but they were great they obviously thought that i had settled down i had a secure job and then i rang to tell them i was going to row in the olympics
363865 they were never pushy parents but they always encouraged me and backed me and i think you have to make your own mind up about what you want to do and then youll give it 100 per cent
363866 dont get me wrong id love to me a formula one driver but i wouldnt have the guts to throw a car around a corner at 120mph and im too big for a start but rowing is the thing that i love and i have done from the moment i got in a boat
363867 ive no regrets when i first left the army i was sleeping on floor at the boat club for six months with a bag of pasta a bag of porridge and tins of sardines then i got 1000 grant and thought all my christmases had come at once
363868 tough times but they are the ones that inspire you and even though im seen as the underdog because of the injury im backing myself to get gold
363869 they have been great over the past four years and not just because of financial help but i have been able to learn a lot from them in terms of business and that is great because one day you have to think about life away from rowing
363870 its not going to last forever its good for them because they can look at me and learn how to bring what i do as a sportsmen into business and it also helps me to switch off
363871 it was a downright insult to both counties to nominate this fixture for croke park on friday night the place would have been deserted
363872 in a sense it is perhaps a bonus that this game is coming up so quickly it means that the boys have had to re focus sharply and the fact that they will be playing in croke park has provided them with an extra incentive in the build up to the game
363873 obviously everyone was gutted by that defeat to armagh but we certainly have not become a bad team overnight
363874 we have lost very very few matches this year so we have no reason to fear kildare
363875 they are a very hard working committed side with a lot of quality players they will relish the chance to regain credibility after the ulster final so we have to have our guard up
363876 i dont think the county board is taking hurling seriously enough we have a young team who are showing great commitment and no little skill but they need to be encouraged and in all ways possible
363877 these boys are very keen to do well they enjoy representing their county and i just want to try and get what is best for them but we need more practical support from t he county board otherwise any progerss that is being made will come to nothing
363878 i suppose you could say that this is a measure of how we have come on but there is much much more work to be done
363879 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues
363880 i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
363881 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
363882 the ioc president jacques rogge met the chinese to discuss this problem all along the ioc has not shifted from its stated position and that was to have no censorship of the internet
363883 the chinese have the right to close down sites that are pornographic or subversive but otherwise everything that should be free and wasnt now will be
363884 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
363885 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations and we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
363886 i just dont know when ill ever make it back here
363887 since the release of the previous shpps in 2000 americas schools have made significant progress in removing junk food offering more physical activity opportunities and establishing policies that prohibit tobacco use
363888 our goal with this report is to provide health and education officials with useful information that will help them develop and improve programs that can have significant benefit for our school aged children
363889 this report is confirming that the awareness of a huge health problem of children growing up overweight is beyond people just being told about it that theres real evidence that action is being taken and momentum is building up
363890 its a little humbling to see that the number of schools that are serving water is now up to 46 percent why isnt it 100 percent a lot of the areas where theres progress are areas that need to be 100 percent
363891 becoming the number one problem among school children i think the health effects of children being overweight will be as great or greater than the impact of cigarette smoking
363892 if we want to build on the improvements that schools have made over the past six years we need to involve many people and programs
363893 families schools school boards and school administrators all need to work together to develop and implement policies and programs that promote health and safety among our nations young people
363894 to improve childrens nutrition and increase physical activity which will in turn improve their readiness to learn
363895 we are pleased to see the progress that has been made from 2000 to 2006 in the areas of nutrition services and food and beverages served outside of schools
363896 with the local wellness policy mandate as well as continued state policy development and the work of the thousands of action for healthy kids volunteers across the country and other committed school personnel parents and community members we are confident that progress will continue to be made in these areas in physical education and other critical areas
363897 we are also looking forward to seeing the full report and to continuing to work with cdc and our other partners as well as our volunteers to address the epidemic of overweight undernourished and sedentary youth and create schools where all kids develop the lifelong habits necessary to promote health and learning
363898 the democratic congressional campaign committee announced today the next round of candidates who earned a spot in the dcccs highly competitive red to blue program these six candidates qualified for the fourth round of the red to blue program by surpassing demanding fundraising goals and skillfully demonstrating to voters that they stand for change and will represent new priorities when elected to congress the candidates for change being named to the dccc red to blue program are running solid campaigns and are committed to making things easier for middle class families in their districts
363899 with less than 100 days to make their case for change to voters in their districts the red to blue program will give these candidates the financial and structural edge to be even more competitive in november

363904 almost half 49 said living together makes divorce less likely 13 said it makes no difference just 31 said living together first makes divorce more likely 7 had no opinion
363905 while researchers say the overall divorce rate is higher among those who lived together before marriage now they dont blame cohabitating
363906 twenty or 25 years ago if you were cohabiting and then married them the marriage was more likely to dissolve and end in divorce
363907 today thats not the case you can cohabit with your spouse and not experience increased risk of divorce were making these finer distinctions that we didnt make before
363908 ochoa and burriss havent had the at bats that velez has had to this point
363909 we want to see more of them than eugenio well play a few games here and well have to decide whether to keep velez here or
363910 it wouldnt serve any purpose to have him up here as a pinch runner or pinch hitter
363911 he needs to cut down on his strikeouts especially the called third strike but that may happen because hes hitting down in the order he wont feel inclined to take pitches if he gets a nice fastball with men on base its a different story
363912 its about time we give them some due respect especially burriss
363913 hes been up here for awhile biding his time and he needs to get out there on a regular basis
363914 a loved and missed family member not a brand name like mickey mouse
363915 this included working with sir donald in relation to the establishment of the foundation and working with him and the foundation to protect sir donalds name and trademarks from inappropriate use and infringement
363916 during this period the firm acted on behalf of the bradman foundation and sir donald bradman in accordance with instructions received directly from sir donald
363917 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
363918 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
363919 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind
363920 however we emphasise the fact that even if the person has spent some time in australia this does not mean that australia is responsible for all events that may befall them in the future
363921 i cannot make my husband see me i have exhausted the limits of my vocabulary and still i cannot forge a connection of genuine understanding i have run out of ways to explain and still i cannot see a light in his eyes when i speak to him

363938 i know many of you are worried some also deeply about the threat of fragmentation within the anglican communion

363941 humans just get carried away by new ideas like dressing up in jackboots and shooting people or dressing up in white sheets and lynching people or dressing up in tie die jeans and playing guitars at people offer people a new creed with a costume and their hearts and minds will follow it may help to understand human affairs to be clear that most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad but by people being fundamentally people

363947 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the us open you have no idea just to type those words hurt
363948 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
363949 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments
363950 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
363951 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
363952 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
363953 not that i meant the times life dealing with my parents
363954 what why i never heard you complain of your parents and are they
363955 pixies yeah just like me well not just like me they are older of course and not as rich or educated and dont quite have the social skills i do and they arent as good looking its awkward
363956 so why did you feel the need to visit me with this news is it because i just got the window repaired and you couldnt resist
363957 i just need a little help they are here for my birthday and will be heading home next week

363971 we found that in fish that do have temperature dependent sex determination tsd a rise in water temperature of just 1 5 degrees celsius can change the male to female ratio from 1 1 to 3 1
363972 if climate change really does result in a rise of 4 degrees which is the maximum the ipcc predicts and if species cant adapt in time or migrate then in the most sensitive cases of tsd were looking at extinction
363973 it could be because of chemical pollution or it could be because of climate change we dont know
363974 our work shows that the original method developed by yamanaka works great
363975 it opens the door to being able to make patient specific stem cell lines to treat diseases that affect people very late in life like parkinsons or alzheimers disease
363976 our lack of understanding of the disease process is preventing us from developing more efficient cures
363977 because the disease is happening in the spinal cord we dont have access to living samples of neurons undergoing the disease process but now we have in the culture dish the very cells affected by the disease
363978 we are not seeing a catastrophic collapse in the job market like you often see in recessions
363979 what we are seeing instead is a steady hemorrhaging of jobs and that is going to continue until housing stabilizes and stops dragging down the rest of the economy
363980 parents dont push their kids to go to work in good times
363981 but they probably are doing so now with gasoline and food prices squeezing family budgets
363982 if you are the federal reserve this jobs report might even be enough to convince you to cut rates again
363983 when the economy barely grows but labor productivity does you are inevitably putting people out of work

363987 statewide we have issued 6 278 citations to motorists who have not complied with the hands free cell phone law
363988 ive seen a couple of people pulled over by police officers and i know im not touching my cell phone unless its on speaker
363989 i think its pretty much the same i see people driving i see people on the freeway all the time you know talking on the phone without their hands free device
363990 a simple wire device such as the one im holding one that goes directly into your ear these things dont cost a heck of a lot of money i mean you can get these for as little as 99 cents
363991 banning telephone use altogether in the car that way people are more focused on driving rather than talking on the phone
363992 every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out on
363993 i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong

364002 sen obama over the past 18 months has been in a robust conversation with americans about health care energy and the environment
364003 during his two recent visits to the mahoning valley john mccain spoke very clearly about his vision for a stronger america that will create jobs and provide relief at the pump
364004 these are the issues that matter to working families and barack obamas status as the worlds biggest celebrity will do little to convince voters that he has what it takes to solve the serious challenges facing our country
364005 americans are looking for someone with solutions and sen obama has those solutions
364006 we need change in the past eight years this country has fallen into a state of neglect

364008 zowat in alle opzichten was hij een rolmodel als speler en als mens was niets hem ooit te veel guy was een sterktehouder een figuur ook waar de jongeren zich aan konden optrekken het wordt onmogelijk om het gat dat hij nalaat op te vullen
364009 hij belde me om te vragen of hij verstek mocht geven voor de eerste training dinsdagavond in de aanloop naar het nieuwe seizoen hij voelde zich te moe door de verhuizing hij had een huisje gekocht en zou eerstdaags uit het appartement trekken we spraken af dat hij volgende week mee zou komen trainen het was de laatste keer dat ik hem hoorde

364015 er is reeds een voorontwerp voor het uitdovend woonrecht en weldra zal alles wettelijk geregeld worden als het parket op deze pv zou ingaan wordt de tweejarige tony veroordeeld en moet hij verhuizen dit is in strijd met het europees verdrag voor de rechten van de mens

364017 hij stak zijn medepassagier zeker vijftig keer en daarna onthoofde hij hem
364018 achteraan zat een dertiger die niemand tot last was en haast niet opviel tot de man plots opstond en een groot jagersmes tevoorschijn haalde
364019 de dader bleef volkomen onverstoord inhakken op zijn slachtoffer ik was de laatste die buiten was hij had ondertussen zijn slachtoffer onthoofd
364020 de chauffeur en ik zijn met ons volle gewicht tegen de deur gaan leunen omdat we vreesden dat hij nog slachtoffers ging maken de moordenaar ging terug naar achteren om het hoofd van het slachtoffer te halen hij hield het fier omhoog en liet het dan zomaar op de grond vallen

364022 voor de praktische uitwerking schakelt de minister werknemersorganisatie voka in die zet in elke provincie een projectontwikkelaar in om ondernemingen te helpen bij het uitwerken van deze diensten
364023 in limburg is er tot nu toe geen goedgekeurd project wel begeleidt voka er momenteel een aantal dossiers gezien de grote schaarste aan kinderopvang in deze provincie vraag ik de limburgse werkgevers dan ook om de komende twee maanden vooralsnog in te tekenen op dit project
364024 ik durf al eens met eddy in discussie te treden
364025 met sneeuw is het begonnen ik ben een winterliefhebber het eerste woordje dat ik ooit als zoekopdracht heb ingegeven was winterverwachting dat was een tegenvaller er bestaan geen adequate voorspellingen voor een heel seizoen dus ben ik zelf zoveel mogelijk data beginnen sprokkelen om zelf een voorspelling te maken ik kan nu in het beste geval tot twaalf dagen ver kijken verder niet een accurate voorspelling voor een heel seizoen zal wellicht nooit lukken mij niet maar ook iemand anders niet

364028 voor de sneeuw en voor het poollicht ik werk aan een model om de verschijning ervan te voorspellen die lappen begrijpen er niets van maar ze beseffen wel dat ik met mijn site bijdraag aan het toerisme in hun land toen ik er de vorige keer kwam zei er eentje tegen me ah ben jij ruben een andere wilde met me op de foto ze beginnen me daar te kennen
364029 tel het maar na ik hoor tot de vlaamse artiesten met de meeste optredens op jaarbasis onlangs publiceerde een journalist een overzicht waar ik niet in voorkwam ik liet hem prompt weten dat hij zijn huiswerk niet goed had gemaakt
364030 hou het maar eens in de gaten het zijn altijd artiesten van dezelfde platenfirma die genoteerd staan ik verkocht van mijn vorige album 6 000 exemplaren maar ik haalde de hitlijst niet
364031 een telefoontje van jos van oosterwijck met de melding dat ik in tien om te zien mag optreden ik bewaar leuke herinneringen aan dat programma tijdens de eerste seizoenen werden we belaagd door dolenthousiaste fans dat was een openbaring
364032 you can play it on this machine but only on this machine we wont let you play it on that one because we dont like them

364050 can you say anything but a paragraph of information right now it is hard following you
364051 oh sorry go ahead and bathe wait i will come with you
364052 we are close that donald and sally didnt get us hey this neighborhood looks abandoned
364053 i think we will have to pick a house to live in and find its goods look for the closest museum and library we can find things there

364086 we back resistance against israel and we were pioneers in such a resistance
364087 but we are against a resistance that has become a militia deployed in the streets of beirut mount lebanon the bekaa and tripoli
364088 this means only one thing the weapons deployed in lebanon are not to be used either in defending its territories or to fight israel but to defend the nuclear program that exists in iran

364093 the country would boost the development of the nuclear power industry by speeding up construction of nuclear power plants in the coastal areas and drawing up plans for the inland regions said zhang guobao director of the newly established national energy bureau

364095 more than 70 percent of the plants equipment will be manufactured in china
364096 the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
364097 once weve had a chance to do that well consider whether the decision should be appealed
364098 i have long pointed out that this administrations claims of executive privilege and immunity which white house officials have used to justify refusing to even show up when served with congressional subpoenas are wrong
364099 todays landmark ruling is a ringing reaffirmation of the fundamental principle of checks and balances and the basic american idea that no person is above the law
364100 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
364101 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
364102 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
364103 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
364104 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
364105 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
364106 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes
364107 net dink aan die negatiewe en god die skuld gee vir alles wat verkeerd kan of mag gaan op hierdie aarde nie

364111 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form

364113 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
364114 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
364115 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
364116 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
364117 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
364118 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
364119 this president is making it impossible for congress to do oversight of the intelligence community
364120 the only effective oversight that can be done is out of the executive branch and this is the fox guarding the chicken coop
364121 we have secret laws governing secret agencies that are engaging in secret spying against americans and theyre using our own tax dollars to do it this isnt keeping us safer its only making all americans suspects in the eyes of the government
364122 issues such as operational coordination and the management of foreign liaison relationships can indeed be complex but in our profession the guiding standard is one of common sense the best solutions are those that get the job done most effectively
364123 intelligence is at its core a practical calling that by definition means a strong voice for those on the front lines those who do the day to day substantive work of intelligence

364129 all it take is a little dip in the polls for john mccain to cast aside his values
364130 how bad does john mccain want to avoid talking about real issues hes running ads with britney and paris is that what americans are concerned about britney and paris do you want to know how we are going to right the ship of our economy or do you want to hear about britney and paris want to talk about how we are going to extract our troops from iraq or do you want to hear about britney and paris
364131 yes thats a trashy ad but the britney and paris stuff isnt about race theyre just trying to say obama is frivolous and insubstantial like so much else in our celebrity culture
364132 the fallacy inherent in how many people think about the way race is used in political messaging
364133 facing an overweight electorate barack obama might find low body fat a drawback
364134 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones
364135 that obama thinks of himself as some sort of quasi religious figure who anointed himself to lead the world
364136 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
364137 senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
364138 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why

364177 he jumped in and was maybe our most productive hitter hes a veteran guy that has understood the responsibility and shouldered the load before so thats good
364178 i told david he won player of the week last year in september when i was fourth so he should be happy but i think when you hit in the middle your approach is the same i think we can make adjustments i dont think that this lineup has to be etched in stone i like it i actually think ill have more opportunities to drive in runs whatever the lineup is if it can translate into wins thats what were looking for

364185 theres no doubt that we do this having reflected long and hard and recognizing the deep concerns and frustrations that canada has gone through over the nuclear history with india but you cant keep somebody in the penalty box forever
364186 the way were looking at it is that our relationship has been underperforming if not in the doldrums completely for a couple of decades now if not more and indias come a long way in terms of democracy and the rule of law and the whole nuclear constellation of issues has evolved to the point where we just cant continue with our position that has been absolute and negative to allowing india back into the nuclear club as it were

364197 this is not crying wolf what does one do to have to capture the attention of the people who are supposed to deal with these issues what tactics are there it was truly done knowing how final it is

364199 im just not sure that the minister realizes what quality he has out there
364200 i nearly fell over when i read that in the paper
364201 the specialists in this area are so scarce across that country that i dont know where the minister of health in newfoundland thinks hes going to find the capacity to transfer these women into
364202 the outcome is poor these women are living under enormous burden the treatments are difficult to suggest that they now have to go somewhere else and have them is just unacceptable
364203 i dont know what id do without her i dont know if id be here without her
364204 the thought of her leaving is extremely upsetting its extremely upsetting for women in this province in general
364205 but i do understand where theyre coming from if there is a discrepancy why shouldnt they receive the same as the other specialists

364217 the islamic center of johnson county inc unequivocally affirms the quran and the sunnah as its eternal and ultimate constitution
364218 if they werent muslim theyd look like one of the biggest catholic churches youd ever seen from an organizational standpoint
364219 i think theyre even working on their first eagle scout
364220 a certain kind of sophisticated thinking is now beginning to emerge because people who were born in the u s are taking over
364221 there are lawyers in the muslim community they werent there before the management is learning how to work things out
364222 of the potential 35 prayers you have in a week for 34 there will be only about 30 people but for that one friday prayer there will be like a thousand people showing up
364223 where do they park they park on the road they park here they park there the prayer starts exactly on time every day so it becomes a huge bottleneck of space and time
364224 if somebody wants to operate a program within our mission and vision they can do it
364225 a free market of ideas and activities thats not centrally controlled
364226 theyre not saying were going to send people and create a new mosque or plant an independent church
364227 certainly it puts the expansion of their congregation ahead of the expansion of the kingdom
364228 because of how streamlined we are you can get off the highway from anywhere and find a mosque that is well maintained well structured and that will always be open
364229 we offer events that arent just one persons vision what we give is something that is formally approved by a committee
364230 if i go into any of the iscf islamic society of central florida mosques i know that just like the marketing material the newsletters and the community announcements are the same the imam is also following the same policy as all the imams in the other mosques to have good relations with people of other faiths so we can understand that we are a part of this country
364231 our rituals and congregational chanting are all pretty much the same
364232 if im in the downtown area i can just shoot over to any mosque for friday prayers
364233 this friday afternoon city police were called to tyson foods to keep tv news crews off the grounds imagine taxpayers dollars in a sense being forcibly used to keep media from fully telling a story
364234 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
364235 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
364236 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
364237 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
364238 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
364239 is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer salat at daybreak on its first day it is a time of official receptions and private visits when friends greet one another presents are given new clothes are worn and the graves of relatives are visited
364240 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
364241 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
364242 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
364243 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
364244 the date for this holiday eid al fitr is not the same each year
364245 all team members who have completed their probationary period are eligible for all eight paid holidays including eid al fitr
364246 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
364247 does have a prayer room to accommodate the needs of muslim team members
364248 in addition to regular non paid breaks all team members are allotted a seven minute paid break
364249 ochoa and burriss havent had the at bats that velez has had to this point
364250 we want to see more of them than eugenio well play a few games here and well have to decide whether to keep velez here or
364251 it wouldnt serve any purpose to have him up here as a pinch runner or pinch hitter
364252 he needs to cut down on his strikeouts especially the called third strike but that may happen because hes hitting down in the order he wont feel inclined to take pitches if he gets a nice fastball with men on base its a different story
364253 its about time we give them some due respect especially burriss
364254 hes been up here for awhile biding his time and he needs to get out there on a regular basis

364257 i was offered a 2 000 us dollar honorarium to pay my creditors
364258 obviously they are afraid of what i might say about singapore
364259 we would assume that her honorarium earnings could be used to help meet her obligations to her creditors
364260 over the next week several hundred athletes from almost a dozen countries will fly the a380 to beijing to compete
364261 my interest is in making sure we have got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
364262 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
364263 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong

364280 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
364281 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
364282 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
364283 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
364284 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
364285 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
364286 preparation of a geothermal based cross border electrical interconnection in the caribbean
364287 the dominica government has determined that greater energy security is one of most important national objectives and that dependence on foreign energy resources cannot be in our long term interest given our countrys energy resource endowment we have come to the realization that the only future for dominica in the energy arena is the development of our renewable energy resources
364288 this government is clear that all options including but not limited to geothermal wind hydro and solar should be investigated as alternatives to fossil fuel in that regard we continue to work with interested investors to adopt energy technologies that are not highly dependent on fossil fuel
364289 edmonton has become a trash bin the cuban athletes were poorly attended
364290 to what is owed the fear by the rich and powerful of our small and blockaded island
364291 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
364292 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
364293 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
364294 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
364295 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
364296 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
364297 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
364298 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
364299 the willingness of the oas to work closely within the inter american system and other partners to support haitis current needs in terms of the revitalization of the agricultural sector and in opening up the country to infrastructural development support
364300 while the oas fully understands that the nomination and confirmation of a new prime minister reside with the haitian legislature and the executive branch the absence of a government could impact negatively on the execution of projects in haiti and on donor assistance
364301 we have noted the interest of the venezuelan government in the banco de venezuela and are in talks at this time to that effect
364302 santander had planned to sell this bank to a group of private venezuelan investors an operation for which certain commitments had been made although no no final agreement had been reached
364303 were going to nationalise bank of venezuela im calling on banco santander to come and start negotiating
364304 they wanted to sell the bank to a venezuelan banker and as head of state im saying no sell it to the government to the state
364305 they are talking they are negotiating and they are going to reach an agreement
364306 we have closed a chapter and are opening have opened another chapter and i am certain that after the reconciliation better times are ahead
364307 he chanderpaul was given the accolade for his consistently outstanding performance as a cricketer especially as a batsman at the national regional and international levels
364308 the bahamas will send a contingent of 110 visual artists filmmakers junkanooers dancers singers musicians writers and theatre artists to participate in this event increasingly recognised as the premier occasion for sharing national culture within the region and showcasing caribbean really culture to the world
364309 art exhibitions workshops native musical performances mega concerts featuring the regions finest global performers along with theatre productions dance performances a culinary festival and a grand market create a unique experience that is not to be missed
364310 we want to offer to the corporate community of the bahamas first of all an opportunity to partner in this exercise
364311 the department of culture has put together some wonderful travel packages as a part of this whole trip to guyana
364312 we have organised airfare direct from nassau to georgetown guyana leaving on 21 august and returning on september 1
364313 the package for single occupancy is 3 000 per person and that includes breakfasts and 2 800 for double occupancy
364314 my government will ensure the independence of the police force we must allow you to do your jobs without fear or favour no one is above the law and anyone who breaks the law should be dealt with accordingly
364315 if we get crime in the caribbean under control then there can be a turn around in the growth and development of our countries
364316 i congratulate former commissioner james on his retirement and wish him well
364317 security reasons have prompted us to decide that president hugo chavez should not participate directly and he has sent a delegation instead
364318 pastors for peace has been organizing caravans to cuba since 1992 a way to express our disagreement with the immoral and inhuman us blockade policy against cuba
364319 our cooperation will strengthen the ties between our peoples which share a common history cultural roots and aspirations
364320 es normal que la principal preocupaci n ciudadana sea la situaci n econ mica y el paro es normal y somos conscientes de ello el gobierno est tomando las medidas que est n a su alcance
364321 the way that the jaaa are forcing us to prepare for the olympics that is not what we had in mind
364322 we believe the people who are doing this preparation have no clue about what they are doing they want the athletes to go with a bunch of high school coaches
364323 they put on this camp only after hearing in february that we were planning to have our own
364324 i guess because they want to ensure that the athletes who i coach dont do well they decided to come up with this camp and this mandatory thing i guess they know that the preparation i have in mind doesnt involve a camp so i guess theres a debate
364325 i dont know what is going to happen but all i know is that they are doing something to try to get rid of my athletes
364326 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
364327 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
364328 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
364329 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
364330 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
364331 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
364332 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
364333 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
364334 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
364335 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
364336 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
364337 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
364338 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
364339 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
364340 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
364341 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
364342 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
364343 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
364344 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
364345 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
364346 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
364347 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
364348 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
364349 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
364350 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
364351 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
364352 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
364353 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
364354 jamaica will not be able to find comparable and affordable accommodation later in august due to the return of students to the tertiary institutions
364355 we have no focus at all on elections elections are not of central importance to us
364356 from adult suffrage in 1951 up to this time in many respects we have had changes in governments and changes in parties that have governed but we have not yet had a fundamental change in direction
364357 but at each and every juncture these messiahs have flattered to deceive
364358 a house a home where all the best practices in regard to good governance should be lift up
364359 we want to look at the problems facing the nation we want to look at the successes over the years we want to look at the bright spots and we want to look at the dark light we want to look at our potential and the draw backs we may face
364360 part of the falling values we see part of the cheapness that is now reflected in some of our men and some of our women come with the fact that they have lost hope that we live in a state of hopelessness and helplessness and the peoples movement for change tends to arrest that problem but you are the ones who would help us do that
364361 we will continue to work with the government of president ren pr val and his new prime minister and hope that this opens a period of enhanced stability progress and cooperation for haiti and its people
364362 a positive development which will allow for even more effective support from the oas and the international community in general towards haiti
364363 vi r s ledsna straffen r f r l ga
364364 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
364365 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
364366 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
364367 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
364368 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
364369 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
364370 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
364371 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
364372 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
364373 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
364374 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
364375 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
364376 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
364377 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
364378 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
364379 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
364380 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
364381 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
364382 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
364383 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
364384 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
364385 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
364386 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

364535 taj gvk hotels amp resorts q1 fy09 sales increased by 3 5 yoy as arr growth in its main hyderabad market remained muted yoy however margin decline of 60bps yoy was less than that witnessed in larger sized peers like hotel leela and was on account of higher staff and fuel expenses net profit remained virtually unchanged on lack of any room additions and marginal arr increases
364536 taj gvk hotels would commission two hotels one each in chennai and hyderabad by cy10 which would add about 405 rooms to its portfolio in addition it also has plans for brownfield expansion at its existing properties in hyderabad which would aid volume growth in future although we expect hyderabad arr growth to continue to remain muted on account of rising airfares and inflation a high interest rate scenario implies that not all the announced hotel projects are likely to materialize in the city we would prefer to observe the evolving room demand in the companys main market especially in the busy season and for now maintain our market performer stance but with a reduced price target of rs 111

364641 its rewarding to be doing something so unusual and challenging
364642 a lot of homeowners have amended the soil and gotten them to grow well enough to have blueberries for their cereal
364643 but for most people its easier and cheaper to buy them
364644 i went to school with merv at byu and utah state he is a passionate plant grower and always had this dream of growing blueberries
364645 i always knew he would do it i just never knew he would go into it on this scale
364646 in the east where traditionally blueberries have grown they have acid soils
364647 they have been fairly successful in oregon washington and now california but utah is a real challenge
364648 with the right varieties i think weve got a niche
364649 it gives him a chance to grow with a team thats building and allows him to stay with the team he came into the league with
364650 he said some real nice things i really appreciate it it was nice of him

364653 child support payments for children on welfare are being used in almost every state to recoup state and federal welfare expenses when congress created the child support system 30 years ago recouping welfare costs by siphoning off collected child support payments was an explicit goal yet close to half the states pass along none of the collected child support while most others pay only 50 per child even when a non custodial parent pays several hundred more

364659 mark guiliana may well be at the forefront of an exciting new style of drumming
364660 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
364661 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
364662 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
364663 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4

364669 people are moving online and there are going to be more questions raised about how moving things online subjects people to copyright
364670 the internet works through copying things thats just how digital technology works
364671 copyright law used to be this obscure thing that only publishers were interested in
364672 its something that now affects everyone when you change copyright law now it affects everybody who owns a pc
364673 there are two cultures the web and the real world and whenever cyberspace comes up against the real world it finds that the real world has a different set of rules
364674 the idea of scrabble the idea that you would get points for spelling words cant be copyrighted

364678 coal fired power plants which supply 78 per cent of the countrys electricity are pressured by rising coal prices and increased electricity prices
364679 ochoa and burriss havent had the at bats that velez has had to this point
364680 we want to see more of them than eugenio well play a few games here and well have to decide whether to keep velez here or
364681 it wouldnt serve any purpose to have him up here as a pinch runner or pinch hitter
364682 he needs to cut down on his strikeouts especially the called third strike but that may happen because hes hitting down in the order he wont feel inclined to take pitches if he gets a nice fastball with men on base its a different story
364683 its about time we give them some due respect especially burriss
364684 hes been up here for awhile biding his time and he needs to get out there on a regular basis
364685 beim geistigen fasten soll die seele wieder frei von ballast werden der den menschen an seiner lebendigkeit hindert
364686 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
364687 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533

364690 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
364691 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
364692 according to a report microsoft isnt just looking at the next version of windows no not mojave for future os possibilities but is looking beyond the windows architecture altogether with a project known as midori
364693 the midori documents foresee applications running across a multitude of topologies ranging from client server and multi tier deployments to peer to peer at the edge and in the cloud data center
364694 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
364695 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
364696 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
364697 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
364698 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
364699 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
364700 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us
364701 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
364702 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
364703 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
364704 i hope chinese media enhance the report of chinese traditional culture
364705 war is the supreme test of man in which he rises to heights never approached in any other activity
364706 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
364707 beware of those powers which come from god but which can so easily be purloined by the devil
364708 a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural or exceptional powers or qualities
364709 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
364710 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
364711 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
364712 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
364713 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
364714 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
364715 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
364716 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
364717 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
364718 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
364719 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
364720 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
364721 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
364722 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
364723 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
364724 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
364725 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
364726 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
364727 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
364728 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
364729 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
364730 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
364731 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
364732 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
364733 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
364734 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
364735 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
364736 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
364737 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
364738 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
364739 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
364740 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
364741 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
364742 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
364743 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
364744 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
364745 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
364746 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
364747 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
364748 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
364749 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
364750 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
364751 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
364752 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
364753 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
364754 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
364755 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
364756 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
364757 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
364758 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
364759 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
364760 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
364761 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
364762 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
364763 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
364764 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
364765 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
364766 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
364767 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
364768 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
364769 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
364770 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
364771 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
364772 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
364773 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
364774 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
364775 i felt like if youre going to clean something it really should be clean
364776 but i had seven children i wanted to go on home i told him im not staying these arent slavery times anymore he said i had to stay i walked
364777 one day we decided to march on the welfare office we asked to see their policies their manual of how they would treat us they said the state couldnt do that so we went up the back steps on a friday afternoon went into the directors office and told him we wouldnt let him leave
364778 storming caesars palace how black mothers fought their own war on poverty
364779 finally we understand that the civil rights movement was a lot bigger and longer than martin luther king as wonderful and important as he was
364780 there are so many levels on which this movement was important not only statewide but nationwide
364781 and theres no question ruby was in the absolute forefront
364782 as long as they graduated and walked across that stage that was enough
364783 it was exciting to see how poor people could stand up
364784 just the way she looked you could feel her power it was so uplifting
364785 im glad shes finally being recognized for all that shes done
364786 so many people give up homes so many jobless people
364787 let somebody make me wealthy before i leave just for one year
364788 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
364789 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
364790 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
364791 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
364792 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
364793 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
364794 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
364795 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
364796 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
364797 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
364798 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
364799 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
364800 gather up everything the creation has been doing and to come and present it before god
364801 estamos a favor de una reforma pero en contra de la privatizaci n
364802 lo mismo quieren hacer con pemex para que calder n luego sea a trav s de sus prestanombres m s rico que el mismo slim
364803 lo que est n tratando de hacer es legalizar una privatizaci n ilegal que ya tienen por eso quieren reformar la ley pero no se puede reformar la ley contradiciendo a la constituci n
364804 cada vez m s observamos que con la venia y autorizaci n de la suprema corte de justicia de la naci n se viola a la constituci n cuando que los ministros deber an de ser los guardianes de la constituci n por eso estamos haciendo este recorrido por todo el pa s para que la gente participe en la consulta y la sociedad mexicana opine sobre los bienes estrat gicos de la naci n para que se defienda una riqueza que es de todos y para todos no un negocio para los grandes capitales extranjeros
364805 el a o pasado con el apoyo del anterior presidente municipal se hizo el barrido sanitario que se requer a para poder ingresar ya solo estamos esperando que se oficialice nuestro ingreso a la zona uno
364806 la ganader a local ha crecido mucho y ya estas instalaciones no han quedado chicas
364807 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
364808 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
364809 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
364810 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
364811 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
364812 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
364813 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
364814 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
364815 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
364816 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
364817 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
364818 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
364819 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
364820 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
364821 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
364822 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
364823 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
364824 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
364825 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
364826 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
364827 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
364828 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
364829 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
364830 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
364831 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
364832 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
364833 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
364834 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
364835 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
364836 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
364837 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
364838 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
364839 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
364840 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
364841 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
364842 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
364843 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
364844 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
364845 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
364846 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
364847 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
364848 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
364849 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
364850 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
364851 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
364852 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
364853 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
364854 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
364855 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
364856 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
364857 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
364858 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
364859 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
364860 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
364861 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
364862 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
364863 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
364864 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
364865 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
364866 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
364867 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

364870 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
364871 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
364872 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
364873 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
364874 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
364875 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
364876 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
364877 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
364878 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
364879 just a matter of getting some of the numbers right
364880 as far as we are concerned chances of the fight happening are around seventy percent
364881 doing his job appropriately and has laid everything out and we are working as a team
364882 dear god thank you very much for sending the money
364883 kebijakan berpakaian resmi akan ditinjau dan pegawai akan dianjurkan lebih santai dengan pakaian dari bahan yang lebih tipis
364884 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
364885 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
364886 you act like a crazy person you apologize but you never change you never mean anything you say to heck with this
364887 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
364888 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
364889 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
364890 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
364891 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
364892 if the vice president says its do able i believe
364893 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
364894 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
364895 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
364896 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
364897 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
364898 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
364899 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
364900 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
364901 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
364902 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
364903 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
364904 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
364905 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
364906 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
364907 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
364908 they made a living through the depression for all of us
364909 they were telling me about boyfriends and going to the movies
364910 they said they could get a job for me at sears roebuck
364911 she said theres nothing here but the sisters that are getting older
364912 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
364913 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
364914 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
364915 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
364916 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
364917 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
364918 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
364919 and anything else that separates us from a full relationship with god
364920 guns were drawn and doors were battered down during this violent interlude
364921 a lawyer a farmer and a railroad man himself elder became disillusioned with the republicans and the railroads
364922 his radicalization brought him to the populist party in 1892 and even farther left after the turn of the century
364923 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
364924 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
364925 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
364926 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
364927 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
364928 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
364929 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
364930 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
364931 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
364932 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
364933 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
364934 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
364935 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
364936 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
364937 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
364938 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
364939 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
364940 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
364941 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
364942 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
364943 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
364944 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
364945 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
364946 the intention to commit any act he commission of which is a necessary element of any offense
364947 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
364948 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
364949 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
364950 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
364951 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
364952 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
364953 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
364954 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
364955 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
364956 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
364957 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
364958 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
364959 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
364960 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
364961 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
364962 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
364963 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
364964 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
364965 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
364966 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
364967 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
364968 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
364969 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
364970 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
364971 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease
364972 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
364973 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
364974 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
364975 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
364976 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
364977 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
364978 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
364979 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
364980 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
364981 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
364982 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
364983 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
364984 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
364985 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
364986 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
364987 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
364988 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
364989 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
364990 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
364991 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
364992 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

365004 i cant wait till i write something so i can read it
365005 close the door write with no one looking over your shoulder dont try to figure out what other people want to hear from you figure out what you have to say its the one and only thing you have to offer
365006 only write from your own passion your own truth thats the only thing you really know about and anything else leads you away from the pulse yours or anyone elses
365007 always stop the days work when you know exactly what your next paragraph will be when you start up again the next day it also keeps your mind writing even after youve put down the pen typewriter computer or whatever
365008 when in doubt read it out loud this helps you find deadwood and lame writing and get rid of it which is all the more important if you use a computer computers seem to lead to flabby and tone deaf writing and we pay dearly for the convenience
365009 i have lost count of the times ive seen the flow of a story spoiled by an ugly sentence and the times that what was printed could not possibly have been what the writer or editor thought was meant

365021 we want people to know we put on a horror convention as big as those found anywhere in the country as weve proven in the past and as usual this year we are bringing a variety of horror guests from classics like creature from the black lagoon
365022 we try to take in all that is part of the horror culture and make it part of spooky empires ultimate horror weekend this year we will have a special tattooing component of the convention screamin ink as well as the freak show film festival a huge costume contest seminars and various q amp a sessions with the celebrities and a video game room
365023 that dohn hurt knock it off fore i knock it off for ya
365024 but i dont think it can apply in a nation like nigeria where journalists are killed for investigative reporting especially as it affects the government and their negative policies
365025 to raise public enlightenment in an effort to strengthen democracy and justice
365026 it all depends which country in dictatorships the media serves to indoctrinate or feed people with propaganda in democratic countries news provides a space to manifest politicians or others misdeeds and sometimes good ones
365027 i would argue that in any society democratic or otherwise news and media can and have been manipulated for the purpose of those in power
365028 coming from a country where the media indulges in self censorship to be safe its difficult to see an appreciation for such a definition in this country
365029 some of the pictures about chavezs social programs are really achievements of past governments
365030 more than six million people have applied for a membership of the new socialist party of venezuela founded by hugo chavez
365031 total population of venezuela is 26 million people 6 million from 26 million
365032 reporting does not have to be making a big picture of a doomsday
365033 do not forget that ethiopia had a flourishing civilization long before america was born and europe was in its dark ages we are a people of a three millennium history with rich culture we are still proud of travel the length and breadth of the country before reporting
365034 i exited iran 4 days early because my fixer was nervous i had interviewed too many people not in favor of the regime or whod just got out of prison or clerics in qom who i couldnt approach directly as a reporter for lack of press accreditation and had to use some very unconventional ways to access them
365035 my fixer too could have been in serious trouble if found helping a non accredited reporter hes served time in prison before and took a lot of risk fixing translating for me
365036 if you dont want your daughter with him why are you with his daughter
365037 as the violence spread to other towns in the rift valley and with looting and killing going on with great abandon a family of 18 hiding from the gangs that had blockaded the main nairobi nakuru highway were locked in and burnt in their house
365038 two wives and their 14 children died the pictures showed the dead mothers trying to cover their children from the fire
365039 out on the highway the gangs stopped public service vehicles and pulled out any passenger belonging to the wrong tribe there was footage of a man who was pulled out and cut into pieces the mini bus sped off leaving him at the mercy of the group
365040 he was stoned and as he dashed to catch up with the bus a rock hits him from behind and he falls on the tarmac the bus runs over him
365041 the pictures of the first incident were not run we feared that other groups would pick up the burning and do it again two or three churches were burnt in copy cats after the first was reported the second incident ran its graphic shocked the nation and the leaders came out to talk it was about the lesser of the evils and exercising judgment
365042 earlier on in the paper k is rather dismissive of two dimensionalism the kind which distinguishes two propositions associated with sentences which have been taken to express a posteriori necessities and a priori contingencies but here it appears that k is merely replacing that bifurcation of propositions by a bifurcation in the notion of truth so in what lies the superiority of ks way of doing it
365043 nothing in the meaning of something or exists is such that it guarantees the existence of something in the manner required for a logical truth
365044 one might respond well one only needs to grasp the meaning of 2

365055 this is unheard of there have even been reports of penguins washing up as far as aracaju
365056 were telling people if the penguins dont appear to be injured or sick to leave them alone so they can swim back
365057 the last time that you got a lot of penguins was in 2000 mostly in rio but some further north that year the sea surface temperature was a degree lower than the 30 year average so the penguins just keep swimming in search of food without noticing where theyre going
365058 most likely there will not be a new record minimum ice year in the arctic this september
365059 its looking rather unlikely that we will beat the record sea ice minimum of 2007

365070 for me to travel from my home in santa cruz to fort in peak hours takes at least an hour and a half i use the train instead and reach my office in an hour or so i dont get tired as well also its much more economical
365071 oh i agree i am just happy to know i am not the only one whose children take turns being the terror
365072 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
365073 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
365074 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
365075 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
365076 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
365077 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
365078 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
365079 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

365087 theres certainly no anxiety about beijings venue construction or infrastructure improvement
365088 we tested the operational capacity of beijing games organizers during a series of test events last year the good luck beijing and got good results
365089 there was the anxiety this week that websites that were reasonable to be opened for the games reporting were closed
365090 we addressed the issue quickly with bocog and these sites are now being opened
365091 wherever you go in the world youll always get censorship in some form whats important is that censorship didnt impede on the justifiable ground for internet access for reporting the games im saying this because now were moving in that direction
365092 readiness to work in a cooperative way with the international olympic community

365133 it was an extensive at bat where i saw about everything in the book
365134 i was just looking for a pitch to hit and he finally got one up in the zone i got it off the end of the bat a little bit but it got in the outfield to score a big run
365135 we overcame some adversity tonight trav hit that three run homer to put us up and then we tacked one on an inning later before things kind of fell apart from there we had a few errors but the good teams overcome adversity
365136 i was lacking a little concentration out there at the start but some times those things cause you to focus a little bit more bobbby wellmann is a good pitcher who keeps you off balance he didn t make a very good pitch and i got lucky i guess
365137 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
365138 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
365139 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind
365140 however we emphasise the fact that even if the person has spent some time in australia this does not mean that australia is responsible for all events that may befall them in the future
365141 a loved and missed family member not a brand name like mickey mouse
365142 this included working with sir donald in relation to the establishment of the foundation and working with him and the foundation to protect sir donalds name and trademarks from inappropriate use and infringement
365143 during this period the firm acted on behalf of the bradman foundation and sir donald bradman in accordance with instructions received directly from sir donald
365144 hes back thats all i can tell you hes back
365145 i used to do that a lot in high school and college not so much in the pros
365146 he had a great game against us a few years ago and he was real brash about it trash talking and things of that nature so its my responsibility to bring it to him
365147 he reminded me of it so we sicced the doberman on him
365148 sometimes these races can be a bit light on in numbers
365149 we thought wed wait and see how the numbers came out and if theyre a bit weak we might throw him in
365150 we thought we might aim at a race like the standish in the summer
365151 if we throw him in the deep end well get a guide as to whether were kidding ourselves or not
365152 i said to him he shouldnt be too far off the speed but if theyre going silly you ride him how you like
365153 hes a gun rider and thats why you put them on
365154 it was not a stellar bletchingly stakes but it gives you a good guide to where hes at and i thought he was very convincing
365155 he really surprised me i didnt think he would finish off that well
365156 hes had a pretty solid preparation and hes probably only got another one or two runs in him
365157 well have a look at the calendar and see how he is
365158 we might persevere a little bit further now and we might not have to worry about the standish
365159 weve had the emirates stakes in mind with him for a long time what race we will run in next i dont know
365160 well just see how he pulls up and pick a race in about five days
365161 when ma shang shot about i thought it was all over but i know how he can fight hes a real fighter

365172 theyre happy mannys happy im going to miss my man im not going to lie to you but were looking forward the team needed it
365173 we need no more distractions here we need to play baseball weve been struggling because of this situation like i said its been a little crazy
365174 things escalated to degrees where something had to be done either way either way i think its a relief that theres closure to something thats been going on for the last week or 10 days im just relieved theres an actual solution which there was going to be regardless on this day
365175 from the front office standpoint i feel like this did have to happen
365176 sometimes you make decisions regardless of whether you got a worse player or better player out of that deal it makes your team as a whole better i think thats what their decision was based on that feeling of camaraderie and 25 guys playing for the goal

365186 you have to focus on that and put all the individual stuff aside
365187 juan for me will play the bulk of the time that is taking nothing away from ethier but matty right now is impressive for me in how he goes about his business somebody is going to have to sit but it wont happen all the time we have to play the backup guys now and again just to make sure they get action
365188 he told us to be prepared for anything just be ready because you dont know what situations are going to come up he is going to do whatever gives us the best opportunity to win
365189 we would like to see as many people trained as we can
365190 the professors are guys who have been out there and done that
365191 i think everyone has a responsibility to be prepared for any type of emergency especially with everything that has happened in the last few months with tornadoes earthquakes and flooding
365192 by being well prepared for emergency situations it saves lives and also helps communities recover quicker and return back to normal status
365193 im so thankful that many national media marketing industry heavyweights took time out to come and talk to us ive learned a lot of new things found out industry news and was able to network successfully with others who have jobs similar to mine

365195 people are buying this national media marketing stuff like hotcakes im thrilled about the success of these products
365196 im really impressed by the presentation chantell grenko did about up and coming national media marketing businesses the reasoning was solid plenty of detail was provided and some of the conclusions were very provocative
365197 i like the idea of having a national media marketing conference in our town but cant sleep at night with all them creating a rucus
365198 it wasnt so bad last year but last night i didnt get to bed until 3 am with all the shananigans going on

365264 this happened after the original title was approved now same sex couples have a right thats recognized and supporters of the proposition want to eliminate that right

365312 on july 26 i watched the entire coverage of the ahmedabad blasts i saw that a maruti wagon r car with the cd series registration was used for one of the blasts next day when i went to varchcha i found that three shopkeepers were discussing what to do with a car parked in front of their shops the number plate was of the cd series i got suspicious and informed the police
365313 when none of the earlier 18 bombs had gone off in surat i was sure that this too would not i didnt fear even once about the bomb that i was carrying
365314 we started a campaign asking our members and acquaintances to move around and look for such bombs we started getting calls from our members and other people and we kept moving from one place to another informing the police about the bombs
365315 the israeli interior ministry say i have a lebanese passport
365316 apparently they think im planning to smuggle more palestinians into the country
365317 my male lead salah bakri is a 48 palestinian and so wasnt allowed to be in ramallah we had the same problem with my production manager and some other crew including the europeans like my director of photography benoit chamaillard
365318 we had about 80 locations around ramallah jerusalem and jaffa
365319 we were denied permission to shoot a very important scene at ben gurion airport so we ended up having to build a set and shoot it there
365320 all the gear for the shoot was in the back of my production managers beat up old pick up truck a silver mitsubishi that old truck got shipped to marseilles because it was cheaper than renting a vehicle in france he left it there
365321 theres a key aerial shot we needed from a helicopter approaching jaffa from the sea since im a security risk the israelis wouldnt give me permission to be in the helicopter for the shot so my camera operator had to shoot it alone
365322 we had plenty of police visiting the set and harassing salah
365323 one day the israeli army blew up the nazareth restaurant my french production designer franciose joset had been there just half an hour before that sort of things very upsetting for the european crew
365324 im not sure but i think this is the only film shot inside israel without israeli line producers when i told my friends i planned to shoot in palestine they told me it would be impossible i told them wed show them it could be done and we did
365325 the way people supported us when they found out what the film was about
365326 was really amazing so many people went out of their way to help us bringing us food and water we had extra production assistants everywhere we went
365327 a lot of our people were working on their first film a jewelry maker a dj kaza at the beginning of the process they had no experience making films but since we wrapped up the shoot theyve kept working there have been three features and seven or eight shorts shot around ramallah
365328 the films about her going to palestine and falling into life among the elite there when she meets this guy from amari camp she finds she cant relate to him at all but they connect
365329 its such a great honor to be premiered there especially with this year being the anniversary of the nakba
365330 but the film was such a labor of love for us and the people who helped us in the camp that it seemed more important to share that pleasure with them prestigious as cannes is theres a sense that this film is for us
365331 ive decided im going to screen the film in palestine anyway whether they let me in or not right now its scheduled for august 21 in al amari camp
365332 those of us who have watched markets for a long time realize the picture can change rather dramatically in a short period of time if something allows people to sell their house more quickly such as a change in the property tax situation or a sudden improvement in the economy
365333 with the population growing the demand for homes isnt going away its just being delayed
365334 more buyers and cutbacks in new construction will eventually draw down the inventory levels and support future price appreciation

365363 i just dont have a comment at this time until i talk to wrona
365364 what i can tell you is on tuesday counsel for community wireless submitted requests to dismiss the six late filed applications for new noncommercial stations in utah
365365 part of what you are seeing is the effect that a stronger and more independent board of trustees is having on the direction of community wireless

365371 a visitor shows up at the door of a club and is issued a temporary free membership card
365372 that if theres a membership requirement a card or an additional hoop that people have to jump through it could enforce the perception that its hard to get a drink in utah
365373 im getting tired of answering people questions on why we have such stupid liquor laws
365374 we cant change the mountains or the weather but abolishing club membership is something that we can change
365375 i do see some problems because it discriminates against utah residents and we certainly want to be fair to everyone
365376 that the availability of alcohol has substantial effects on alcohol consumption and alcohol problems

365405 its a luck thing if it works ill stick with it youve got to get that food in you
365406 you just put a little more uppercut to the ball
365407 i was already 3 for 3 so there wasnt much pressure its weird knowing theres potential for even more
365408 after i hit the triple i stepped on third and i told my coach i have two more at bats i should take a couple of swings to try and get it he told me hey go for it and sure enough i put it into the left field seats
365409 it was just one of those nights where you cant do anything wrong
365410 ive been hot lately and this is icing on the cake
365411 my teammates couldnt believe it they had an awesome time
365412 ive been asked what im doing differently and the truth is im doing the same thing ive always done
365413 its been working out in my favor the last few months but its true you get into a groove and you cant explain why youre in them i cant explain why im swinging the bat so well
365414 ive heard people talk to me about the orioles giving me a lot of thought
365415 its a good possibility when rosters expand but ive been in this position a couple years and it still hasnt happened
365416 im not really going to get my hopes up too high i know a lot of things can happen ill just keep doing what im doing and see if it will work out
365417 it might have had something to do with being on the ground

365452 the kr is much more than just a great straight line performer its the complete package handling power and performance
365453 the team put the gt500kr through rigorous testing and have witnessed slalom runs with sustained lateral acceleration of 1 0g on the skidpad those are world class numbers
365454 for example a new front splitter and revised rear spoiler aid in aerodynamic improvements adding downforce over the front axle and moving the center of aero pressure forward in the vehicle to improve high speed balance and stable predictable braking character
365455 the kr is more responsive and has more body control
365456 it delivers even more racing feel than a stock gt500 yet its still extremely comfortable and doesnt beat you up like some performance cars weve been able to increase handling substantially without giving up a lot in ride comfort

365467 im probably the most famous flag football player in america
365468 that was my inspiration going to college i wanted to play basketball that was my first love but i was always better at football
365469 football came a lot easier basketball i had to work at but i enjoyed playing it a lot more
365470 its like if you get a call from the president of the united states
365471 i dont know if it ever happens to any guy or if it happens all the time here but for me it was huge
365472 i dont think theres anything were doing he hasnt done before
365473 those guys are lightning fast but i still run pretty well and i still feel i can block so i like to think of myself as a complete tight end thats something im trying to stress to david and ben and young guys as well strive to be a complete guy not just guys looking at you as a pass catching tight end
365474 i still feel that competitiveness you need to have i still just enjoy getting up in the mornings and having something to do rather than being a couch potato
365475 it wont be well can i go one more year when its gone itll be gone and i know itll be gone
365476 for me i just think that we are in an era of people that dont really appreciate the history as much as they should and i might be wrong
365477 sometimes i joke with players and ask young guys do you know who
365478 you hear some of the stories that have gone on some of the trials and tribulations that they had to go through
365479 a lot of guys dont really understand and i think it was good for the rookies to go there
365480 for guys that come into the league to not have some kind of understanding other than the fact that i am getting paid a lot of money youre doing yourself a disservice
365481 you really truly should understand the people that have come before you
365482 we are playing a lot of people so we need to prepare more than one player at a position because we know that we will play two or three players at each spot you have to cut your preparation down to being realistic instead of playing 60 plays in a game maybe you only play 20
365483 how many plays do you need if you are only going to be in there for 20 plays you dont need the biggest game plan of the year for guys that are only going to be in there for 15 to 20 plays you scale it back and adjust
365484 its just a sports fantasy dream to have someone you watched play ask you to introduce them into the hall of fame

365529 the whole team worked together and was there for each other the whole week we supported each other and were confident all week
365530 this is my second time winning it and i think it may be even sweeter than the first
365531 during our first match on the first day we realized that we were grinding too much and not having fun we realized that its just golf and that we needed to work together as well as we can and keep each other up and pumped up it worked out well for us
365532 i got to watch someone else do it last year
365533 to be the person that got to do it this year was awesome i didnt make too many putts this week but i hit the ball really well
365534 the weeks been great this is my first time in the canon cup and its probably the best tournament that ive played in all year
365535 i loved the team atmosphere that was present and how we all got psyched up every day it was so much different than a normal golf match we all know each others strengths which played a huge part in this victory for our team
365536 its always fun to be a part of it we tried our best to win it but we were too far down
365537 i just want to continue playing well i really liked playing on this course
365538 they really fed off each other and carried the momentum over into each day
365539 they just kept having fun and supporting each other out there
365540 one of the keys for us has been to get leads early in games
365541 i played in a tournament with a 54 foot mound recently and that extra six feet today definitely helped me
365542 we have a great defense and i know if they hit it theyre going to make the plays
365543 the great thing about dylan is how quickly he warms up
365544 he can move right for shortstop to the mound without me taking him out of the game to warm him up and be effective
365545 even though today i didnt really feel like i was on top of my game our defense made plays
365546 also these kids are tournament tested theyve played a lot of high level ball at their relatively young ages
365547 the key in any baseball game is pitching and im very confident in my pitching staff
365548 on any given day if one kid doesnt have it out there somebody else will step in and get it done
365549 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
365550 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter

365947 you feel that way every time i can show you transcripts of our chats
365948 the best songs the beatles write add dimensions of experience and imagination to our lives revealing new realms into which we might not have entered without a little help
365949 so much of its melody line is disguised harmony that singing it without chordal support makes for comic results
365950 the melody of the voice parts is very difficult to sing particularly without the underlying chords to keep you oriented have you tried singing this song in the shower lately
365951 the words werent so meaningful but the chord changes really had magic in them
365952 they were doing things nobody was doing their chords were outrageous just outrageous and their harmonies made it all valid
365953 plunge from the home key of g major onto an unstable b minor
365954 in short they had no preconceptions about the next chord an openness which they consciously exploited
365955 remember to let her into your heart and then you can start to make it better
365956 yeah ill tell you something i think youll understand when i say that something i want to hold your hand
365957 much of the pairs musical originality derived from their self taught willingness to let their fingers discover chord sequences by exploring the architecture of their guitars rather than following orthodox progressions of which they knew little
365958 the rise and fall of the experimental style of the beatles
365959 the beatles and their times thoughts on the relative autonomy of stylistic change
365960 rock is a four letter word which means a new awakening

365964 and we believe in jesus christ conceived by the holy spirit and born of the virgin edna
365965 we have no money and only five loaves and two fish what can we do
365966 i can do all things in him who strengthens me
365967 if we dont stop the destruction of life well come to midnight that is nuclear war in which there will be a total disregard for life
365968 we need the protection of mary we need her to put her mantle around our country
365969 she continues to obtain graces for us and we need grace to do what she last says in scripture do whatever he tells you
365970 moved by grace mankind turns toward god and away from sin thus accepting forgiveness and righteousness from on high
365971 this is my body an evangelical discovers the real presence
365972 behold your mother an evangelical discovers the blessed virgin mary
365973 do es not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state defined age of majority
365974 in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do for they think that they will be heard for their many words do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him
365975 what you did for the least of my brothers you did it for me
365976 when we introduced the one minute monk to catholic radio in late may we were unsure of the response
365977 nearly 70 of catholic radio stations have already agreed to air the show with more telling us they will likely work it into their fall rotation we just recorded the second dozen episodes covering everything from prayer to anger to joy and so much more i myself didnt realize how a short booklet written to order monastic life in the 6 th century could apply to our modern life outside a religious community
365978 when i moved down here two years ago to join the college
365979 i lived for two months as a guest in the monastery i was given a copy of the rule and observed firsthand how the monks lived according to it in discussions with them i began to realize how it is a guide to daily growth in holiness that can aid us all whether within monastery walls or without a benedictine monastery is a family and the rule is truly a guide to family life well god puts us all into families of one kind or another so it actually makes a lot of sense to introduce the modern stressed out maxed out on the go catholic to the wisdom of 1500 years ago whats more when our holy father chooses benedict as his name it suggests that he thinks the original benedict had something important to say to us today
365980 its been the hard word of the people who stepped up energetically to execute it which has made this a success story and not just another interesting idea
365981 the challenge is to retain that richness that elegance that permeated the written english of educated men a hundred or even fifty years ago
365982 temper ing the archaic tone that turns away too many readers
365983 the strong to have something to strive for and the weak nothing to run from
365984 dont detect my modem i will select it from list
365985 the girls in high school can seem scary i remember my freshman year some girls showed up drunk at the very first dance and i was shocked but i just kept my distance and stuck with my group my friends were all good girls and they still are
365986 the good girl revolution young rebels with self esteem and high standards
365987 i wanted to showcase a new generation of role models beyond paris hilton and britney spears to get people thinking about and talking about girls who represent something deeper there are so many amazing young women out there but all you usually see in the media is the exhibitionists
365988 youll have some challenging experiences and its a good idea to go into the next four years knowing that it wont always be easy but raising good girls is entirely possible and worth the effort
365989 my fellow americans im pleased to tell you today that ive signed legislation that will outlaw russia forever we begin bombing in five minutes
365990 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
365991 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
365992 wall street got drunk and now it has a hangover the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
365993 thousands of traders and executives that pumped up the credit boom made specific decisions to buy ever more collateralized debt obligations they saw competitors making a mint and followed suit if they were under the influence of anything it was greed
365994 i knew ronald reagan ronald reagan was a friend of mine barack obama is no ronald reagan
365995 even some of reagans aides were embarrassed by the tear down this wall line thinking it was too provocative or grandiose
365996 ronald reagan wasnt the only lame duck at the economic summit in venice last week and he wasnt the only allied leader to nod off when the proceedings turned soporific
365997 it is the ultimate paradox of reagans lifelong opposition to all things communist that a u s soviet arms agreement and a third summit with gorbachev officer the best and perhaps last hope for reinvigorating his presidency
365998 i wonder if they have ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek no one would ever be able to do what theyre doing again
365999 people of the world look at berlin where a wall came down a continent came together and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one if we could win a battle of ideas against the communists we can stand with the vast majority of muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope

366001 those top issues that remain somewhat enigmatic to many of us we can tackle those do the research respond with all the proper principles and provide those to our policy makers while at the same time taking our findings and wrapping them up in a form that the general public can understand
366002 are life human sexuality family and bioethics and our briefs are designed by academics actually to inform on the issues in about 1100 to 1200 word average
366003 its not enough to only inform policy makers and in order to reach the public we have to use modes such as radio television email public conferences public events small networks and ultimately to reach the people in the pews
366004 maintaining linux libre takes me two to three minutes a day most of the time no clean up is required because the non free bits in linux tend to remain in place and i have scripts that will let me know whether theres anything new that requires manual intervention it took me several workdays to write these scripts and i still tweak them every now and then but its mostly trivial maintenance these days when a new linux release comes up it takes me just a few minutes of attention to prepare a freed tarball because ive been accumulating the preparation for it throughout its development cycle
366005 its not a community that values users freedom as much as it values convenience
366006 i had reports from developers involved with gnewsense and blag another free distribution whod tried to submit patches to clean up non free software from linux and who had been lets say laughed and cursed out of the room
366007 the idea of adding yet another kernel split was perceived as a risk of bringing all that grief back so the idea of offering additional kernels built out of linux libre was vetoed
366008 it does nothing to address the problem of other obscure chunks of code in the kernel often derived from documentation under non disclosure agreements or from non free drivers that dont offer permission for the code to be distributed under the gnu general public license
366009 to build a complete general purpose operating system exclusively from free software
366010 thats a question i ask myself every time i face this kind of hostility
366011 i expected negative reactions to the idea of replacing the non free kernel
366012 but i thought adding an alternative 100 free kernel built out of 100 free sources was going to be a no brainer
366013 and id really like to be able to recommend to people out there a distro that the company i work for helps create it was quite disappointing that a community that set out to create an operating system exclusively from free software would not permit anyone to install or distribute a system without also installing or distributing non free software
366014 it is a historic event and a big step towards the final approval by us congress it will provide india additional source of energy which it desperately needs
366015 we are hopeful that india will get unanimous approval from the 45 member nuclear supplier group no doubt there are some challenges in the second and third steps time is of the essence for ratification of 123 agreement by us congress
366016 like true leader prime minister manmohan singh took a bold step and risked the survival of his government for the national interest
366017 the policemen were overstretched trying to prevent mobs from setting afire the government buildings and vehicles hence the army had to be called out
366018 the situation is taking a grim turn these are difficult times and we will have to take difficult decisions to deal with the situation
366019 india is a vibrant democracy that shares our values of freedom democracy human rights and the rule of law
366020 will strengthen the international non proliferation regime by placing additional civilian nuclear facilities in the worlds largest democracy under international monitoring
366021 indias rapidly expanding economy has an increasingly large demand for energy canada recognises the need for india to employ clean energy solutions if we are to truly reduce greenhouse gas emissions nuclear power emits virtually no greenhouse gases and it will play a critical role in developing a clean energy future as part of a global climate change strategy
366022 theres no doubt that we do this having reflected long and hard and recognizing the deep concerns and frustrations that canada has gone through over the nuclear history with india but you cant keep somebody in the penalty box forever
366023 i think both sides feel that ceasefire is the most important confidence building measure between india and pakistan and it should be upheld as being a very useful cbm
366024 if you ask me to define the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years because we face a situation where things have happen in the recent past were unfortunately has effected the future of dialogue
366025 on friday there is a realisation amongst saarc countries that it is only by co operating within saarc that we will be able to strengthen ourselves individually and as a region and address the many common challenges that face us
366026 investors seem to have realized that the business yahoo is in is a very complicated and challenging one and the current macroeconomic environment is even more challenging
366027 so turning over the reins to an unknown quantity doesnt appear to be the prudent thing to do at the moment
366028 at no point did the board and management ever resist microsofts proposal
366029 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts

366031 thats something that i dont even know how to describe
366032 it went from 28 to 66 to 99 and then to 34 and 11 and i dont know what else and them back to 99 again
366033 i dont want them to treat me different than other guys if they want me to cut my hair i cut it dont worry itll grow back
366034 if this is the petite dining hall lad im afraid to see the grand one

366037 it was agreed that the long heroes holiday will give banks sufficient time to slash the additional zeros from banking systems
366038 remember we had already taken off three zeros and so this wont be a difficult job
366039 banks expressed that they were fully behind the currency reform and were prepared to implement the new monetary measures

366044 we have worked hard these first few months to get into a situation where we can go where we want to go
366045 you have to focus on that and put all the individual stuff aside
366046 juan for me will play the bulk of the time that is taking nothing away from ethier but matty right now is impressive for me in how he goes about his business somebody is going to have to sit but it wont happen all the time we have to play the backup guys now and again just to make sure they get action
366047 he told us to be prepared for anything just be ready because you dont know what situations are going to come up he is going to do whatever gives us the best opportunity to win

366049 there are two positions for part time workers opening up but were only hiring seasonal and well pick the part timers from there
366050 oh crap shes not kidding this is the wrong lock
366051 when you get yourself in to trouble is when you feel you have to do something and then you get yourself in trouble
366052 lets build a stupid hill in centerfield so we can risk the health of our multimillion dollar players on a regular basis
366053 damn i love videogames and i want no part of that show
366054 what we found in the study is that for example over half of all cases of tb among foreign born persons occur among just 20 percent of the overall foreign born population
366055 that includes mainly persons who are born in southeast asia sub saharan africa and south asia as well
366056 we believe that this is helpful because while it might not be possible to test and treat all foreign persons for latent tb if programs can try to focus on the highest risk groups and can reach out to the populations that need this testing and treatment the most then theyll have a greater chance of preventing as many cases as possible for the number of tests that they are able to do
366057 herded into a cattle arena and prodded down a cattle chute coerced into guilty pleas and then to federal prison
366058 is not an unusual one based on what we have seen in this court and in this community
366059 one can only wonder where his concern was on the dates in question
366060 its hard to imagine that someone who acknowledges his concern for children of that age puts himself in that situation and causes the implications hes caused he showed no concern for her well being he was only concerned about his own personal satisfaction
366061 we understand the value that immigrants hold in our society whether documented or undocumented
366062 we are mandated to enforce the nations immigrations laws and we continue to aggressively do so
366063 ice is here and available to work with any law enforcement that requests assistance
366064 if there is any violation we want to get to the bottom of it we want to make sure we continue to be leaders in the nation on this issue
366065 its always been seen as a place thats been more open and friendly to immigrants
366066 this particular announcement is a further step in making immigrants feel that their rights are going to be protected
366067 they treated us as if we were criminals on the streets and all we were doing was working
366068 were not doing anything wrong everybody needs to work to eat you work you eat you dont work you dont eat
366069 the officer who was questioning me said that he was helping me and i told him that arresting someone and forcefully removing them from their family is not helping them
366070 the cops that arrested me and drove me to the station were racist they were rejoicing in how wonderful a job they did and celebrating their victory against immigrants thats racism
366071 i cant work i suffer from anxiety and paranoia my world was flipped upside down ice agents seem to delight in our misery they pressure us with fear so that we will leave willingly they tried to get us to sign papers that said we were giving them the right to deport us

366082 itll be an adventure for the kids and we want it to be fun but at the same time the kids will hopefully take some things home and apply it and share it and create a lifestyle that will be more environmentally conscious

366084 given the importance of the temple in the conservative and orthodox movements whether spiritually or practically we reformists would do well to consider exactly what we would be tying onto ourselves were we to adopt tishah bav observances
366085 would this then also entail re instating the tri fold division of our people into kohanim leviim and yisraelim priests levites and israelites as we mourn the loss of the temples and the sacrificial system it embodied
366086 does mourning the loss of the immense and rich culture of european jewry that existed before the shoah mean that we desire to return to a ghettoized isolationist shtetl lifestyle
366087 there is merit in our knowing the history of the calamities which befell our people on this date in the jewish calendar
366088 the point of these fasts according to maimonides is not their historical referent but rather that their historical referent should cause us to reflect upon the reasons that brought us to catastrophe tisha bav the ninth day of av is a fast which memorializes the breakdown of the polity and forces us to confront the radical possibility that an ethical or just polity is itself impossible for this reason the customs of the day such as not greeting one another and sitting alone and not engaging in business or even in torah study all these are performances of the dissolution of society
366089 we often run the risk as reform jews of living as though we are observing our religion through the practices of our co religionists
366090 do we want to build the third temple and return to a sacrificial system of worship
366091 sharing lessons on what it means to be religious in a secular society
366092 the time has come to engage in dialogue with our muslim neighbors and to educate ourselves about islam
366093 muslims have instinctively turned to the example of jews in america to understand how to deal with the challenges we face as religious minorities whether these challenges involve securing the right to religious accommodation in public institutions or dealing with workplace discrimination at the same time i believe that the jewish community will also benefit from having muslim partners in the struggle to uphold the constitutional separation of church and state to promote civil liberties to extend religious accommodation to minorities and to counter prejudice and hatred
366094 i dont know how to describe it the only thing i know is that im going to play the game hard and give all i have to help the team
366095 every time people ask me about boston i pull my brain and go pop
366096 im not going to waste any energy when people talk like that
366097 i took like 5 000 pounds off my back coming here i want people to judge me on what i do here not on what i did in boston im thinking dodger blue right now im happy to be playing here and im excited to wear blue ive been playing this game for 15 years and im like a little kid now
366098 its a new chapter in my life and im nervous

366100 the officers wanted to know if we had any guns
366101 this isnt about definitions this about action on the ground to help these workers
366102 my brother in law said that mom could find something good to say about everybody even for people who didnt deserve it
366103 there was so much prejudice against hispanics she didnt see it
366104 it was not her problem the problem of the people who were being prejudiced she just chose to overlook it thats why she was able to excel
366105 in addition to all the other things they did my mom and dad made television commercials and newspaper ads after they retired
366106 they got hooked up with a modeling agency after they retired most were for health companies and retirement communities they had so much fun
366107 she used to say that she spent her entire life preparing to meet her lord
366108 she loved to barbecue eschewing charcoal briquets making a bed of coals from scraps of wood as her father had taught her
366109 as you grow up with it its just regular food to you
366110 then when you get out into the real world you realize what a great cook she really was
366111 we wanted a week of peace and quiet and hiking with the kids so i googled sequoia cabins and then this house popped up that looked fantastic with close proximity to a river in fact you can hear the river from the house
366112 since the trip we have decided to spend one week each month not using electronic devices
366113 it will be our attempt to relive the vibe from kaweah
366114 healthy alternatives to big box condos and hotel gift shops
366115 i offer a great place at the right price and the value added is that it is also eco friendly
366116 i think people are becoming nostalgic in this crazy age of technology
366117 searching for life as it used to be more simple more thoughtful about the way we treat the land we live on and more sensitive about the food we eat
366118 people come here to connect to nature and eat better
366119 we offer them fresh eggs free range chicken and produce from the garden all organically farmed
366120 in the u k there is a back to basics trend occurring
366121 people want to go walking in beautiful landscapes rather than lie on a beach boiling in the mediterranean
366122 and these residences because they are all made with natural materials are very high quality
366123 our goal is not to rub guests down with all the sustainability issues better for them to just come and enjoy it and see the difference
366124 we loved everything about it and so did the kids
366125 my husband and i dont want to get to italy with a 13 year old and be looking at each other and thinking
366126 it quickly went from a brainstorming session to an oh my god what have we gotten ourselves into moment
366127 what i liked is that i didnt have to be the mom on this trip
366128 sometimes they dont understand that 45 minutes means 45 minutes
366129 some people believe that you can even see the ghost of marco polo wandering these streets
366130 the opportunity to wander a vast glacier frozen in time

366139 this is the peoples house this is not pelosis politiburo
366140 the fact that democrats left before getting their work done is highly disappointing
366141 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
366142 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
366143 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
366144 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
366145 what are you looking at you wanna get your balls busted
366146 is there any difference between the awrah of free women and the awrah of the slave women and what is the limit of the awrah of the women to other women and what is the limit of her awrah to her mahram like her father and her brother
366147 there is no difference between the awrah of the free women and the awrah of the slave according to the correct opinion which some of the authenticators have chosen like shaykhul islaam ibn taymiyyah and others and it is that her whole body is awrah except the face and the hands
366148 gesu vuole servirsi di te per farmi conoscere e amare egli vuole stabilire nel mondo la devozione al mio cuore immacolato
366149 il 10 dicembre 1925 mi apparve in camera la vergine santissima e al suo fianco un bambino come sospeso su una nube
366150 abbi compassione del cuore della tua madre santissima avvolto nelle spine che gli uomini ingrati gli configgono continuamente mentre non v chi faccia atti di riparazione per strappargliele
366151 guarda figlia mia il mio cuore circondato di spine che gli uomini ingrati infliggono continuamente con bestemmie e ingratitudini consolami almeno tu e fa sapere questo a tutti coloro che per cinque mesi al primo sabato si confesseranno riceveranno la santa comunione reciteranno il rosario e mi faranno compagnia per quindici minuti meditando i misteri con lintenzione di offrirmi riparazioni prometto di assisterli nellora della morte con tutte le grazie necessarie alla salvezza

366155 plug it in for 10 minutes and miraculously it appears that youre back to full strength how can that be we all know its not actually back to full or gt 80 as the bars would suggest so what is actually going on marketing
366156 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
366157 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them
366158 however the post office does not allow for contraband to be freely delivered so in their defence they would be guilty of negligence if they know it is contraband then they are obliged to act and stop it much like the post office does
366159 already more than 1 6 million people have contacted the fcc and congress to protect net neutrality

366162 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
366163 or if they opened letters mailed to you decided that because the mail truck is full sometimes letters to you could wait and then hid both that they read your letters and delayed them
366164 if the mail that i was sending contained items that broke the law i could hardly complain if the post office refused to deliver it

366206 it was no problem you can just owe me an errand run in the future some time it wont be for a while but ill just keep it in mind thanks just dont forget
366207 hey there remember you owe me a favor for running that errand for you the other day
366208 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
366209 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
366210 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and off shore drilling
366211 we hope barack obama will realize that his ongoing opposition to john mccains realistic energy solutions and additional off shore drilling is wrong
366212 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
366213 this is a company that we are determined and very excited to transform
366214 the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft right from the start
366215 we all cross bridges and im not talking about metaphors

366219 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
366220 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
366221 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
366222 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
366223 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
366224 the governor promised california when he was running for this job that he was the leader that could work with the legislature to get responsible budgets for california
366225 i needed this job to continue to do my part in being their mother to provide them with the security that they need
366226 it hurts me to my heart to have to tell my sons this
366227 understands how difficult this is going to be for state workers
366228 its a day by day situation so well try to manage
366229 i knew when they start cutting jobs youre going to get poor service
366230 we dont believe the governor has the authority to lay off state workers by executive fiat and thats what that executive order does
366231 we will defend ourselves in court if necessary to make sure the state can meet its obligations
366232 imagine going in to talk to your boss and saying lets talk about wages and he says well im cutting you to minimum wage now what do you want to talk about
366233 he just looked worried depressed anxious way turned into himself
366234 it would be overstating it to say he looked like a guy who was being led to his execution but its not far off
366235 almost everybody believes that he had absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax

366267 we heard for years and years that we were producing too much and now thats changing its a turn around for farming in europe and i think its a big improvement for us
366268 basically what we are seeing is a big drive towards intensification which will put huge strains on the environment
366269 set aside has been abolished with hardly any thought to the implications we are predicting a threat to many wild species biodiversity will feel the heat from this
366270 one of the most important issues will be water quality we are already facing very severe ground water and river pollution problems in europes most heavily cultivated regions
366271 what we are saying is that when you take set aside away you need to replace it with a targeted scheme which will keep its environmental benefits or face the consequences
366272 the whole philosophy now is to free farmers to follow the market and not just chase after the biggest subsidy from brussels
366273 we are asked to deliver food for reasonable prices and at the same time we are asked to maintain biodiversity
366274 and its a difficult question should we do the biodiversity thing or should we respond to the market requirements i dont think we can do both
366275 the main issue over the last one or two years is the high food prices internationally and if we didnt respond to that by producing more then the accusations against farmers would be more serious
366276 there is definitely no doubt that the drive is on at the moment to produce more
366277 ive been following agricultural policy and its the sort of subject that stops dinner parties in their tracks
366278 suddenly its on the front pages and everyone is crucially interested in how farming affects what theyre paying in the supermarkets
366279 i think a fundamental change is coming its that farmers will concentrate less on their role as custodians of the countryside and more on providers of food the return a farmer gets from the market will always come first

366289 it is a tremendous honor to be the first museum to present these drawings as a group to the united states
366290 we are deeply grateful to the biblioteca reale and to the foundation for italian art and culture for facilitating this initiative the birmingham museum of art is committed to bringing to our community objects of global significance that broaden appreciation for artistic endeavor our understanding of the world and ourselves these drawings by leonardo da vinci offer an unparalleled opportunity for careful observation and insight into the mind of a master

366298 he would love to get a score but he is a tough bloke and has played well over the last 12 to 18 months he has had a bad run of scores but we have supported him because we think he can come through
366299 we picked what we thought is the best team for england he will be disappointed he didnt get a score today but he will get another chance in the second innings
366300 there is nothing wrong with the pitch and we are disappointed we didnt bat better
366301 the team need to show some character and get stuck in which they will do
366302 we scrapped all day and we needed wickets to get back into this match im reaping all the hard work ive done with lancashire physiotherapist dave roberts after my ankle operation

366308 people say test cricket is dying but its clear that is not the case what more do you want than periods of play like that

366317 police you shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
366318 i was feeling good and i was hitting the ball well but then all of a sudden i just got exhausted completely lost my concentration
366319 it was hard for me throughout you know for that rest of the match to keep up because the points were quite long the longer the play went i felt worse and worse
366320 im suffering in that department it will take time for me to get that better because at the moment you know im struggling to play in a high level for two sets
366321 if i was playing three sets i dont know they would probably take me in an ambulance
366322 its ok doesnt matter the first ranking i want to be healthy

366329 i think if i played a couple of mens tournaments in a row itd be a different story but its hard to play one a year you know
366330 i think if i played eight in a row and missed all eight thatd be a different story
366331 but i gave it my best today and i feel like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones that i made mistakes on
366332 i had about a 10 footer there and thought if i birdie the last five ill shoot 59

366336 we judged there was no need to immediately report it since it would not have any impact on humans
366337 i believe the foreign ministry should report a matter of this kind immediately to the prime ministers office and make it public when it is notified by the u
366338 i too came to know about it this morning on television
366339 i wonder why the foreign ministry didnt communicate to local communities when it obtained the fact since its about radioactivity i wish they had handled it properly
366340 philippes story represents a kind of magical moment where the towers these two vast monuments to capitalism were transformed as an artistic canvas for 45 beautiful minutes
366341 so i decided very early not to engage or reference any images of a disaster that is obscene and involves the tragic loss of thousands of lives when philippes story is the absolute opposite of that
366342 i just had this crazy idea to marry these two wonderful buildings with a cable
366343 my mind was a tempest a tempest of pleasure and elation a tempest of surprises
366344 the practice counted for very little because practice a few feet off the ground can never represent what it is like to mingle with the void to feel an ocean of nothing underneath you with the turbulence in the air and the aggressivity of a giant precipice
366345 i turned down dozens of offers because a lot of them were commercially oriented so i was totally uninterested i said no to becoming an instant millionaire
366346 i honestly think that these days one would be shot before you could do something like that
366347 i have many secret projects buildings around the world that i would love to walk between but we live in a different world and i dont want to be shot attempting it
366348 its very frustrating for me to see structures being made and to think i would love to put my wire there because if the phone doesnt ring or i dont get the invitation from the owners of the building then its impossible
366349 what is web logging and why everyone is talking about it
366350 this terrorism is certainly one of the issues which for us is a very important part of the issues in the summit

366352 i will address the present challenges and promote reforms from the peoples viewpoint looking ahead to the future of japan and the world
366353 the referendum does not solve anything it just offers the prospect of a new election
366354 this will make mps more responsible towards the voters this will give us an instrument to hold parliament to account
366355 the possibility of dismissing parliament would stand as a warning to mps that they have to take public views into account
366356 parliament is elected once every four years and has to work during that time

366381 otherwise its going to pass you by if a woman is sitting there thinking oh my god i know this beautiful man and he is so smart and witty and funny then why doesnt she do something about it its the same as somebody dying to learn to scuba dive and not doing anything about it its the dumbest thing ive ever heard i dont understand why you wouldnt pursue something that youre passionate about
366382 when someone comes up to you and starts to make conversation but pretending its not a big deal like he didnt really come over just to talk to you thats creepy its okay to go up and say hi i dont know you but id like to introduce myself thats clarity and clarity is good

366438 bugger you i dont have to explain my reasons for going where i please because the world is indeed free for muggleborns to wander as much as that must pain you would you prefer that i were off somewhere being tortured to death by your fanatical heroes in halloween costumes is that what you want or would you rather youd never met me and that i be damned to live uneducated amongst muggles whod never be able to even begin to help me understand myself is that why youre up here sulking am i not miserable enough for your liking is that why you feel the need to verbally abuse me when all ive ever wanted from you is your affection
366439 you do not have the right to speak to me that way you never have and never will no law of mortal men can change that the ministry cannot clear the filth of your blood or alter the details of your birth truly you are nothing more than an uneducated muggle asserting yourself as if youre worth something well youre not not to me and not to the rest of the wizarding world
366440 in case youre too simple to have noticed i do have the right to speak to you however i want
366441 and it has been proven time and time again that anything a pureblood can do a muggleborn can do just as well if not better have you forgotten our last session in the dueling chamber so soon dear

366444 because im tired i dont want to do this anymore i dont want to love you anymore youre certainly not worth the pain youve done a splendid job punishing me for ever giving a damn about you already dear the dark lord would be proud of how expertly youve used my emotions against me too bad your boss is dead but maybe if you torture enough mudbloods you can have his job
366445 i would rather not have to do this again should you insist on placing yourself between a slytherin and his ambitions youll only be another casualty
366446 you had the loyalty of a hufflepuff but thats clearly less than worthless to someone like you
366447 you love the people that love you you hear the music they move to you give your ode to the fall through but you dont know you dont know you dont know you dont know you love the people that love you you hear the music they move to you give your ode to the fall through but you dont know you dont know you dont know you dont know you you just got off work huh another night feeling like the worst one you didnt even count your tips yet but you can tell that it aint no big step i dont see why you so nice to customers theyre all fucks and low lives but dont fight just keep the lip stiff and get that money its the weekend shift but why they all gotta be freaks wish they would just eat and leave and keep they eyes to theyselves already insecure dont need any help but you can blame the pride that makes you hold your anger inside but deep down you wanna curse them all fuck off asshole jerk off dirt ball you love the people that love you you hear the music they move to you give your ode to the fall through but you dont know you dont know you dont know you dont know you love the people that love you you hear the music they move to you give your ode to the fall through but you dont know you dont know you dont know you dont know you now attitude check still show up you havent quit yet and even when your meat gets sweet they still treat you like a piece of meat huh outrageous each day this clock tick tock and you still a waitress trying to pay them student loans and the lights and the phone and the food and the home and you aint quite broke but you couldnt afford that place on your own gotta roommate to split the rent with now you never feel independent and everything seems so hallow cause after work whered that smile go better bring it back tomorrow now pick up the pace and you might make bar close perfect last call then some flirtin sexual tension surfin through them men cause they all searching for that bent one but just one to bend and you look like you could be my friend with a smile like that i gotta flirt girl you just look like you got off work huh huh huh you love the people that love you you hear the music they move to you give your ode to the fall through but you dont know you dont know you dont know you dont know you love the people that love you you hear the music they move to you give your ode to the fall through but you dont know you dont know you dont know you dont know you
366448 the malaysian governments record provides little basis to believe this is anything other than a partisan political attack on anwar

366460 the irony of this case is that the immigration officers arrested these women at the hostel provided by their company if they were at the hostel why did they arrest them for running away from their employment
366461 this is not against any of the immigration laws however not only did the immigration arrest them they also put them in the immigration prison and are now even arranging for their deportation

366745 when you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality other people get killed not you then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you after being severely wounded two weeks before my 19th birthday i had a bad time until i figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me whatever i had to do men had always done if they had done it then i could do it too and the best thing was not to worry about it

366751 first say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do
366752 we have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable

366759 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat
366760 somebody may beat me but they are going to have to bleed to do it

366762 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of those moments we choose we either take a risk and move toward what we want or we play it safe and choose comfort most of the people most of the time choose comfort in the end people either have excuses or experiences reasons or results buts or brilliance they either have what they wanted or they have a detailed list of all the rational reasons why not

366936 when you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality other people get killed not you then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you after being severely wounded two weeks before my 19th birthday i had a bad time until i figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me whatever i had to do men had always done if they had done it then i could do it too and the best thing was not to worry about it
366937 the minute you start talking about what youre going to do if you lose you have lost
366938 first say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do
366939 we have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable
366940 anything is possible but you have to believe and you have to fight
366941 the fear of suffering is often worse than the suffering itself
366942 its only pain and its only suffering its not going to kill you and if its not going to kill you whats the big deal
366943 i never saw a wild thing sorry for itself a small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself

366946 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat

366971 im not about to tell you my views on the end times
366972 i look at my life and see what looks like both good and bad fruit
366973 every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
366974 in the 1980s there was a successful fruit company out of california they were publicly traded the company did just fine at first exported a lot of fruit but didnt make a huge splash the company then experienced many flat months and some that appeared absolutely wretched
366975 today that company is worth 10 times what it was 10 years ago
366976 and i played a little trick on you the fruit company is apple
366977 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come
366978 those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires
366979 therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of god
366980 my dear children for whom i am again in the pains of childbirth until christ is formed in you how i wish i could be with you now and change my tone because i am perplexed about you

366986 i voted for the drill act because it provided our country with an opportunity to drill more here at home and decrease our dependence on foreign oil
366987 unfortunately the republicans voted it down i will continue to vote for legislation that will allow for more drilling in the united states including off of the coast and in anwr the hard working families of my district cannot afford 4 a gallon gasoline or 5 a gallon diesel fuel they need relief and they need it now it is time for the partisan games in washington to end

366997 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
366998 gw1516 activates the ppar delta protein but the mice must also exercise to show increased endurance it seems that ppar delta switches on one set of genes and exercise another and both are needed for endurance
366999 activates the ppar delta protein and mimics the effects of exercise thus switching on both sets of genes needed for the endurance signal
367000 signals the cell that it has burned off energy and needs to generate more it is pretty much pharmacological exercise
367001 its pushing your genome toward a more enhanced genetic tone that impacts metabolism and muscle function so instead of inheriting a great set point you are using a drug to move your own genetics to a more activated metabolic state
367002 the drugs effect on muscle opens a window to a world of medical problems

367007 theres another reason for working inside the system dostoevsky said that taking a new step is what people fear most any revolutionary change must be preceded by a passive affirmative non challenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people they must feel so frustrated so defeated so lost so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future this acceptance is the reformation essential to any revolution

367009 i will ask for your service and your active citizenship when i am president of the united states this will not be a call issued in one speech or one program this will be the central cause of my presidency we will ask americans to serve we will create new opportunities for americans to serve and we will direct that service to our most pressing national challenges
367010 tonight i speak to you not as a candidate for president but as a citizen a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
367011 the democratic socialists of america dsa is the largest socialist organization in the united states and the principal u s affiliate of the socialist international dsas members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly socialist presence in american communities and politics
367012 in the united states we must fight for a humane public policies that will provide quality health care education and job training and that redirect public investment from the military to much neglected urban housing and infrastructure such policies require the support of a majoritarian coalition of trade unionists people of color feminists gays and lesbians and all other peoples committed to democratic change our greatest contribution as american socialists to global social justice is to build that coalition which is key to transforming the power relations of global capitalism
367013 many socialists have seen the democratic party since at least the new deal as the key political arena in which to consolidate this coalition because the democratic party held the allegiance of our natural allies through control of the government by the democratic party coalition led by anti corporate forces a progressive program regulating the corporations redistributing income fostering economic growth and expanding social programs could be realized
367014 we are not a separate party like our friends and allies in the feminist labor civil rights religious and community organizing movements many of us have been active in the democratic party we work with those movements to strengthen the partys left wing represented by the congressional progressive caucus
367015 we call for the united states to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from iraq and afghanistan
367016 we call for an end to the u s occupation of the province of guantanamo cuba
367017 we call for an end to the israeli occupation of the west bank east jerusalem and gaza and an end to all u s aid to israel as a precondition for peace
367018 we demand the immediate withdrawal of the united states from the north american free trade agreement nafta and the central american free trade agreement cafta and oppose the creation of a widened free trade area of the americas ftaa
367019 we call for a steeply graduated income tax and a steeply graduated estate tax and a maximum income of no more than ten times the minimum we oppose regressive taxes such as payroll tax sales tax and property taxes
367020 we call for the restoration of the capital gains tax and luxury tax on a progressive graduated scale
367021 we call for the end of all anti gay lesbian bisexual and transgender glbtq restrictions in law and the work place the repeal of all sodomy laws and the legalization of same sex marriage
367022 we oppose all efforts to declare english an official language and call for an end to all language discrimination we demand that all public and private institutions provide services and materials in the languages of their communities
367023 we demand full support for every womans right to choose when if and how to have children including the right to free abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy without interference or coercion
367024 we support public child care starting from infancy and public education starting at age three with caregivers and teachers of young children receiving training wages and benefits comparable to that of teachers at every other level of the educational system

367028 if offshore drilling would provide short term relief at the pump or a long term strategy for energy independence it would be worthy of our consideration regardless of the risks
367029 but most experts even within the bush administration concede it would do neither it would merely prolong the failed energy policies we have seen from washington for thirty years
367030 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
367031 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

367065 an emr is essentially an electronic version of the medical records normally kept by physicians in paper format this electronic record is kept and maintained by the physician and his or her staff it is considered to be an unadulterated history of any and all care a particular physician provides to a particular patient these systems are generally only accessible to medical staff not the patients themselves although some advanced systems are granting patients viewing access but not editing privileges

367068 because we are not going to ask the taxpayers of new zealand to wait 18 months to get the second round of their tax cuts theyve waited far too long

367074 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
367075 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
367076 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
367077 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
367078 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
367079 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
367080 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there
367081 maintaining linux libre takes me two to three minutes a day most of the time no clean up is required because the non free bits in linux tend to remain in place and i have scripts that will let me know whether theres anything new that requires manual intervention it took me several workdays to write these scripts and i still tweak them every now and then but its mostly trivial maintenance these days when a new linux release comes up it takes me just a few minutes of attention to prepare a freed tarball because ive been accumulating the preparation for it throughout its development cycle
367082 its not a community that values users freedom as much as it values convenience
367083 i had reports from developers involved with gnewsense and blag another free distribution whod tried to submit patches to clean up non free software from linux and who had been lets say laughed and cursed out of the room
367084 the idea of adding yet another kernel split was perceived as a risk of bringing all that grief back so the idea of offering additional kernels built out of linux libre was vetoed
367085 it does nothing to address the problem of other obscure chunks of code in the kernel often derived from documentation under non disclosure agreements or from non free drivers that dont offer permission for the code to be distributed under the gnu general public license
367086 to build a complete general purpose operating system exclusively from free software
367087 thats a question i ask myself every time i face this kind of hostility
367088 i expected negative reactions to the idea of replacing the non free kernel
367089 but i thought adding an alternative 100 free kernel built out of 100 free sources was going to be a no brainer
367090 and id really like to be able to recommend to people out there a distro that the company i work for helps create it was quite disappointing that a community that set out to create an operating system exclusively from free software would not permit anyone to install or distribute a system without also installing or distributing non free software
367091 on friday three newspapers published opinion pieces that address issues related to health it adoption
367092 i want to be clear that the board controlled the process of dealing with microsoft
367093 to this day i cannot tell you why they withdrew their offer to acquire us
367094 there may be a few more dollars on the table
367095 there was never anything given to the board in writing
367096 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
367097 i still believe theres something there to be gained i want them to buy yahoo
367098 i think yahoo is a leader in internet human rights efforts
367099 weve done right with the families and ive been personally involved we have a lot more work to do weve condemned the chinese government for blocking peoples use of the net and set up a fund for internet and any human rights abuses around china
367100 we started the company and took an aggressive open source approach not for any religious zealot reason but just because we saw it as a good value proposition for the customer
367101 we tried to do open source software and hardware and it has not been the success we hoped for
367102 it is open but not as much open source as the work we did before
367103 we dont actually have a rich community of third parties that are developing and extending the product and thats probably the acid test for an open source project
367104 the personal health record landscape is rapidly changing many issues are being uncovered including concerns over the privacy and security of an individuals personal health information in the phr access and control of data secondary uses of data and sources completeness and reliability of data in the phr
367105 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
367106 and if the fcc turns around now and gives the companies the get out of court free card it means the fcc is going to be condoning what was past illegal behavior and letting the companies off the hook for illegal behavior
367107 a national regulatory framework protects customers from a confusing patchwork of state regulations
367108 there have been questions about the access to the internet and other issues at the olympic centers
367109 we think the chinese government needs to heed those concerns that if china is going to demonstrate it is truly moving forward as a modern society this is part of it
367110 the international olympic committee and the beijing organizing committee of the olympic games should fulfill their commitment to full media freedom and provide immediate uncensored internet access at olympic media venues
367111 censorship of the internet at the games is compromising fundamental human rights and betraying the olympic values
367112 this is a slap on the wrist for comcast but it will be a cutting off of the hand for the next provider who violates rules
367113 if we didnt do this wed go out of business
367114 i dont quite see metering as an outrage and in fact is probably the fairest system going though of course the psychology of knowing that youre paying for bandwidth may change behavior
367115 i was getting creamed so its probably a good thing in that respect
367116 scrabble and scrabulous are not really about the game what makes them fun is the way they help me connect with the personalities of my friends and family
367117 the world is a sadder lonelier place today what kind of society are we that allows such a thing to happen
367118 things got to the point where they had to do something and they did
367119 theyre happy mannys happy im going to miss my man im not going to lie to you but were looking forward the team needed it
367120 we need no more distractions here we need to play baseball weve been struggling because of this situation like i said its been a little crazy
367121 things escalated to degrees where something had to be done either way either way i think its a relief that theres closure to something thats been going on for the last week or 10 days im just relieved theres an actual solution which there was going to be regardless on this day
367122 from the front office standpoint i feel like this did have to happen
367123 sometimes you make decisions regardless of whether you got a worse player or better player out of that deal it makes your team as a whole better i think thats what their decision was based on that feeling of camaraderie and 25 guys playing for the goal
367124 that is so not what i was hoping to hear
367125 classification system for rating games that is flexible and appropriate for the internet and carries a single set of trustworthy and recognisable symbols
367126 the current system of classification comes from a time when videogames were in their infancy
367127 we have also seen a big growth in games aimed at a grown up market which invariably include scenes unsuitable for young people
367128 may not command confidence in the games industry and could not provide significantly greater clarity for consumers
367129 parents want a simple classification system for videogames the hybrid system will do little to ensure the long term protection of children
367130 pegi offers the only ratings system that can fully assess all game content said michael rawlinson the managing director of elspa
367131 it currently rates 96 of all games released in the uk as opposed to only 4 which the bbfc assess
367132 youtube and google should not be made to place this vital asset in hazard merely to allay speculation

367280 the calming effect of rocking your baby comes from its effect on the vestibular system which is located in the inner ear and regulates equilibrium making it possible for your baby to find her place in space before birth as you carried your baby in your belly she was constantly moved and rocked as you walked around bent up and down and went about your day so at birth your babys vestibular system is programmed to expect movement to a newborn baby with little body awareness stillness can be disconcerting as you rock and carry your baby you are not only helping her to relax you are also enhancing her development with every movement fluid moves in the canals of the vestibular apparatus sending nerve impulses throughout the muscles of the body this process helps your baby develop head and body control which are prerequisites for learning later skills such as sitting crawling and walking later the integrity of the vestibular system is related to childrens ability to concentrate to sit still and to read so if your baby responds well to being rocked or seems to demand it please trust that this is exactly what he needs

367360 it could be that mikko has a better position on the road tomorrow although the day was perfect for me today
367361 i think we have got the settings on the car quite right now the springs and dampers are perfectly matched it is difficult to know if running first on the road will give us a disadvantage there are some new stages tomorrow which are generally sinuous and twisty but we shall see
367362 generally the day has been very good and my driving felt really nice i dont mind being second and although seb was faster there are still lots of stages tomorrow some of which are new so anything is possible
367363 its hard to say exactly where we are compared to the opposition
367364 but clearly they are very quick i did not feel too comfortable on the softest tyre while on the harder one which i used first the situation was much better
367365 as usual on the first day at the hungaroring it is difficult to understand how the tyres are behaving because you always get a lot of graining while the situation changes bit by bit as more rubber goes down on the track surface
367366 we know in which direction we have to work and we will do all we can to bring home a good result it will be tough but i am confident all the same
367367 we worked on various set up options for the car
367368 i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail the situation is not too bad
367369 the track changed a lot during the day and its quite a demanding place with lots of corners but i enjoyed driving the circuit and i hope things continue like this tomorrow
367370 it was a typical day of practice with a lot of laps covered and lots of data to analyse this evening to be ready for tomorrow
367371 overall we improved the car and we are moving in the right direction
367372 we still have a few things to improve but if we can make the most of the final free practice session tomorrow morning we should be able to approach qualifying in good shape

367390 bonjour a tous j ai bien lu tous les commentaires et voudrais avoir quelques conseils
367391 i have a small team of activists that blog for me from computers in my home where i have a personal office
367392 as a body the middletown human rights commission is of the opinion that mr gallaghers comments on his
367393 the biggest fe mod you can make is to adjust the nut behind the wheel
367394 i wanted a place where my friends and i could hang out and listen to some great rock music with a cool atmosphere there were no options in vegas so i made my own
367395 wasted space will feature the top rock artists weekly in addition to the hottest djs in the country
367396 at the crystals weve joined two preeminent architects studio daniel libeskind 1 and david rockwell to create an international gathering place that combines art design and experience
367397 our incredible array of luxury retailers and dining destinations coupled with a spectacular design will make the crystals a must see shopping destination
367398 these extraordinary brands will be joined by many others in the months to come
367399 the final details of this project are coming together as we progress toward our opening at the end of next year
367400 i am especially proud that our development is located at the most significant location on the las vegas strip
367401 we are the worlds first vacation ownership resort directly connected to a major resort casino and retail mall complex and surrounded by the most prestigious properties in las vegas we believe ph towers by westgate will provide our 400 000 timeshare owners with vacation experiences unavailable anywhere else in the world
367402 there are several sites that sell hotel rooms and tickets to las vegas shows but we want bestofvegas com to be the easiest to use provide the best content and most importantly offer the best prices
367403 this is an especially exciting time for us as we expand we are looking for people who share our dedication to excellence and passion for impeccable personalized service at wynn resorts we are committed to providing both our guests and employees with extraordinary experiences unlike any others
367404 we are incredibly proud of our reputation and were seeking people who want only the best for themselves and their families if you expect to accomplish great things value what you do and want an employer who is going to recognize your contributions this is where you belong
367405 so you need to make one hundred and fifty dollars just to be at zero
367406 then i forgot to pay the bill and the satellite got shut off
367407 esp as in 6th sense second sight extra fuckin sensory perception
367408 all you have to do is open your fridge grab a beer and ask whos ready for a beer and suddenly theres bill standing there with his hand ready for a beer
367409 i can make him appear in my yard as if by magic
367410 all i gotta do is throw that steak on the grill and
367411 ill be we could get bill to teleport with that mental telepathy stuff
367412 ill be we could take a bottle of patron silver tequila straight from the freezer compartment in a house in houston texas and pull the cork on it the bastard would suddenly be sitting next to you with a shot glass ready
367413 hell thats nothing last summer i was down on the river fishing id trolled up and down the river about 20 times over one of my favorite spots
367414 there were no boats out nobody on the bank no airplanes no birds no animals it was me and god out there in the damned boat
367415 i figure its a good time to sneak a smoke i look around again pull out a joint and no more than have it lit and there is bill using a log like a surf board headed out to the boat for a drag off my joint
367416 but there i have another name you must learn to know me by that name this was the very reason why you were brought to narnia that by knowing me here for a little you may know me better there
367417 o o yeah right ok stand away from me now so i can talk about you to my friends
367418 youre cool when a person first meets ya but then you get dull and stupid and so on meaning we get to know you and ew so yeah i shall fade away slowly now
367419 er spricht f r mich er spricht f r mich
367420 you re a guest of mayfield and i have no problem with you just please dont bother them
367421 we could win but since shes a teacher she can always claim shes a pauper and you wont see a dime
367422 wordless breathless boneless feckless startlingly small this boy will fall
367423 friend or frenemy a guide to the friends you need and the ones you dont
367424 i had a work colleague who i really liked so i invited her to brunch with me and my friend
367425 a few weeks later i ran into them having dinner together at a restaurant they had been hanging out nonstop without telling me
367426 when we feel rejected its natural to feel sad and angry but looking at the situation from another perspective helps
367427 perhaps the co worker or bridesmaid or friend is simply looking for a piece of herself in someone else and that person is not you it doesnt mean you arent valuable just that friends are made for many reasons change over time and can come back together again when emotional and psychological transitions have been worked through
367428 ive definitely poached but ive also made an effort to keep up the friendship with the original friend who introduced us
367429 ive even gone so far as to gossip about the new friend with the original friend to prove my loyalty
367430 its usually not done in a malicious or vicious way
367431 better to be up front than to go behind her back
367432 its good manners to ask your friend to join you the first and second time you hang out with the new person
367433 point out to your friend that spending time with just your new friend does not diminish your feelings for your old friend make an effort to spend time with each of them individually so your old friend wont feel left out or pushed aside
367434 as you start to spend time with your new friend realize that there will be hurt feelings talk to your original friend about what she may be feeling give her a chance to express her feelings dont get defensive this is a natural response
367435 let the first friend know that you still value your friendship with her
367436 but your friendship is different not better than the new one
367437 a state of tension or hostility between islam and the dar al harb the non islamic world is constant
367438 there was never a time when the world began because it goes round and round like a circle and there is no place on a circle where it begins
367439 in the same way there are times when the world is and times when it isnt for if the world went on and on without rest for ever and ever it would get horribly tired of itself
367440 god also likes to play hide and seek but because there is nothing outside of god he has no one but himself to play with
367441 now when god plays hide and pretends that he is you and i he does it so well that it takes him a long time to remember where and how he hid himself
367442 of course you must remember that god isnt shaped like a person
367443 god is the self of the world but you cant see god for the same reason that without a mirror you cant see your own eyes and you certainly cant bite your own teeth or look inside your head
367444 er no madam the pool is of course for men only i am so sorry
367445 we have everything ready for you we have cordoned off the pool placed screens all around
367446 so if you have everything you need i shall lock you out here so that you wont be disturbed
367447 i have to congratulate you madam i think you are the first woman to swim in public in all saudi arabia
367448 no a big revolution i dont think you realise how big
367449 so since youve screened it all off does that mean i dont have to wear an abaya
367450 isnt it ironic the three owners of professional sports teams in denver stan pat and stand pat this rockies ownership never ceases to amaze they are content with trotting out a triple a caliber pitcher every other night meanwhile arizona is pitching lights out and slugger manny ramirez went to the dodgers but no worries in camp monfort
367451 i have to take issue with your characterization of denver receiver brandon marshalls legal problems with his former girlfriend slugging your girlfriend in the face is not an indication of a romance gone sour its domestic violence
367452 you think its hard to believe the broncos no longer have a need for john lynchs leadership gee kiz you must have a great source to come to this conclusion lynch wasnt happy playing second fiddle and coach mike shanahan didnt judge lynch good enough to play in all situations lynch wants to take his ball and go elsewhere shanny gave him permission to find it seems like a fair shake to me how is it the broncos are the villains in this oh i see charlie monfort left cant pull off big trades stan kroenke and pat bowlen do denver post file photo you want lynch to start regardless of how good he can play that makes a lot of sense kiz brilliant
367453 thats a way to be a leader john lynch after four years of playing great football for denver the captain for the d quits on the team it would have been nice to see lynch end his hall of fame career with some dignity
367454 although i am a born hillbilly dont count me as a nascar fan how can you sit there and get excited about some racer building an advantage you know is all going away when the next caution flag flies its all scripted for a close finish

367471 if you look at ism and the unemployment number together it suggests an economy that is at best stuck in neutral
367472 but we are forecasting continued growth in the economy for the back half of the year and it will be that growth that will determine a return to job creation
367473 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system a growing credit crunch we need to do more
367474 we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002
367475 overall the report looks to be broadly consistent with other data that show the economy quite soft basically stalled not growing very much but not contracting very much either

367509 are there securities where valuations are high absolutely says tim ghriskey chief investment officer at solaris asset management but we do not have the risk we had in 2000 where valuations were at historic extremes
367510 surely not but were not at a low extreme either
367511 its just worth pointing out that whenever the stock market is at valuation ratios that gongloff and company consider
367512 but the situation without trade is not a philosophically noteworthy benchmark under either libertarian or utilitarian perspectives the libertarian wants maximum freedom the utilitarian wants maximum social utility neither goal is best served by trade restrictions the fact that some people lose when trade is opened up has no philosophical significance

367588 theres certainly no anxiety about beijings venue construction or infrastructure improvement
367589 we tested the operational capacity of beijing games organizers during a series of test events last year the good luck beijing and got good results
367590 there was the anxiety this week that websites that were reasonable to be opened for the games reporting were closed
367591 we addressed the issue quickly with bocog and these sites are now being opened
367592 wherever you go in the world youll always get censorship in some form whats important is that censorship didnt impede on the justifiable ground for internet access for reporting the games im saying this because now were moving in that direction
367593 readiness to work in a cooperative way with the international olympic community
367594 over the seven years that weve been working together weve always been able to get results that were both comfortable with
367595 at the end of the day bocog will fall into line with ioc requirements
367596 biggest meeting ever in history on the globe between the east and west
367597 im very confident that when the eighth of august comes next friday it would be the opening of one of the greatest games of all time
367598 the rate of physical development is the most obvious change and therere also changes in social activities and the peoples dress relaxation communication and their awareness of the olympic movement
367599 many things in social and economic terms have changed in the past seven years since beijing won the bid to host the games in 2001 and the changes are drastic over the past 30 years statistically 400 million people have been brought out of poverty over that period thats astonishing

367659 in the us kids have affairs before marrying but here its seen as a sin but thats changing now
367660 bpo employees belong to the high disposable income group usually all the employees working in this sector are young mostly fresh out of the college and are from the economically productive age it is very important to teach them about safe sex hiv aids during their induction period
367661 a countrywide study has been initiated in all it and related sectors including the bpo industry world bank institute has created a web portal where all the material is being uploaded
367662 most of the bpo employees are between the age group of 19 22 and may lack adequate knowledge about the virus or how it spreads these youngsters are straight out of college and are more vulnerable they need guidance and counselling
367663 we believe that apart from installing condom vending machines bpos should also educate their employees about safe sex techniques during their induction this will help create more awareness among youngsters
367664 employees working in bpos are well educated and are old enough to know and understand the importance of safe sex also there are several other sectors that also have high disposable income so it will be wrong to say that bpo employees are more vulnerable
367665 it is partially right that huge salaries are slowly leading to moral degradation but there are many youngsters who work in the bpo due to necessity rather than luxury
367666 though i support the idea of having condom machines inside the office premises i personally feel that imparting sex education during induction is a bad idea
367667 we are planning to rope in atms that have more than 200 transactions per day it will increase accessibility and assure privacy

367684 on the one hand it is so unexpected to find such a fragile bulla in such harsh conditions of excavation while on the other hand it was logical to find precisely here the bulla of gedalyahu ben pashur only meters away from the place where we found the bulla of yehukhal ben shelemyahu since these two ministers are mentioned side by side in the bible as having served together in the kingdom of king zedekiah
367685 police you shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate

367687 the director and his crew were in mysore for four days and did a bit of research on ravi vermas contributions to the royal family they visited the palace to get a better picture on his style his life and career as an artist they hope to find more details about the artist when he was still alive ketan also approached the palace authorities and the state archaeological department for permission
367688 colour is in this season both internationally and locally bright and citrus hues have become popular abroad and the trend has caught on here as well thanks to air conditioned tents wearing of strong bright colours in summer which was once unthinkable has now become possible and although we are still shying away from it colour is definitely in this summer we too have introduced stronger turquoise and bright pinks and complemented them with pale pinks
367689 while colour is being worn these days by brides it should be done in an innovative way so it doesnt look like the outfit has been purchased from jama there is a very thin line between classy and pass and care must be taken not to cross it
367690 white suits a darker complexion and must be worked with a lot of colour if worn by someone with fairer skin so as to show to their advantage
367691 we have been doing a lot of long mughlai coats worn over ghagras boasting lengthy trails and accompanied with long dupattas the ensemble makes a strong statement and we have been adhering to simple non fussy cuts their advantage is they are relatively reasonable and one can get wear out of them later by donning the coats with trousers
367692 we are going to experiment with printed bridals we will be prototyping our printed range and translating it into a silk line
367693 to move away from dark colours toward for instance kashmiri pink which is the new red now as it looks good with diamonds as well magenta and oyster pink are also being sported by brides these days
367694 the bridal outfits tend to be modern and non conventional for this occasion western cuts and styles are adopted with fish tails etc being popular the palette too is generally pastel and whites and off whites are often preferred this summer the popular colours are soft ferozis and oyster pinks
367695 whether one wears a sari or a gharara depends entirely on personal choice
367696 the one thing the bride must keep in mind when selecting her outfit is whether the event would be indoors or outdoors as for colours everything goes and one should choose the colour depending on ones complexion the only general thumb rule is that dark colours are normally favoured for night occasions and white for the day
367697 summer brides should have their skin in good shape so that it looks fresh and not clogged if the skin is good the base make up can be light in order to achieve a healthy glow the bride should maintain a balanced diet prior to the wedding make up should be neither too light nor too dark soft colours are in as are smoky eyes while soft pink cheeks are the rage as for hair styles it is better to have the hair up in a bun away from the face
367698 insist on getting your joras at least ten days prior to the wedding make sure you get your fittings and trials done at least two to three weeks ahead of the scheduled date and then try the kameez again just a few days before the wedding as brides to be tend to lose weight also try on your jewellery with your jora to see the effect sometimes brides realise at the last minute that the necklace string is too short or too long or that the jewellery is not complementing the outfit and then get into a panic
367699 reds and maroons are still popular with brides as always but the matt look has gone there is a lot of concentration on the eyes which are now very smoky with a kohled look while lips are left pale by and large a natural look is being preferred by brides regardless of whether the wedding is in summer or winter hence cakey bases are totally out as for hairstyles normally the front half is tied up with very little back combing loops are normally preferred when putting up the hair rather than anything elaborate
367700 bridal joras have become more modern so brides now want a look that complements their clothes also there is improved and greater variety of make up available locally so there is more room for experimentation shimmer is in too but some summer brides like to avoid it particularly if their function is taking place outdoors as the high humidity can take its toll
367701 the soaring price of gold is deterrent enough in opting for opulent sets those who want to go for jhumars and tikas do so only to either return them after the wedding or to exchange them with some other more practical jewellery in fact many dont bother to invest in them at all and wear artificial jhumars and tikas
367702 big necklaces just stay in lockers so now brides are more practical they opt for example for diamond chains in their necklaces which can later be removed and worn on their own while the centrepiece can be worn separately on an ordinary chain similarly stones are interchangeable in sets nowadays
367703 moms jewellery and rhodium polish is given to gold sets to give it a white look
367704 pinks and peaches on the face are very popular here and bronzers are totally out false eye lashes are a complete no no although eyes are the main focus of bridal make up and kohls and brown shades on the eyes are the rage eyebrows are very defined now with maybe even a little colour added to them

367710 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
367711 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
367712 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
367713 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
367714 a 76 to 90 percent drop in installed capacity from the previous year
367715 you know that i think is an indication that they dont have many good ideas in terms of actually solving problems for the american people
367716 and my goal is to keep talking about the issues that matter
367717 if you continue to see an economic slide that is going to cost far more in terms of tax revenues because businesses arent selling taxes arent being collected

367787 the bracelets would take the place of boarding tickets it would also work as a gps to track air travelers and their luggage
367788 no pun intended if the passengers act up it the bracelet would shock and immobilize them for several minutes
367789 i guess the design was that for any air passengers who would become a terrorist or be a terrorist
367790 the bracelet has a capacity to shock the whoever is wearing it kind of like a police taser
367791 remotely activable electric shock device on each of the passengers
367792 the bracelets remain inactive until a hijacking situation has been identified
367793 its so silly on so many levels its hard to imagine
367794 there is no level of threat here that justifies anything like this
367795 we have been interested in the reusable security bracelet idea you told me about
367796 it is conceivable to envision a use to improve air security on passenger planes
367797 when you got this letter what was your first reaction
367798 by putting an electronic handcuff on them passengers and then shocking them passengers like a dog if they get out of line
367799 that whole proposition was never part of the proposal to us
367800 the only use or proposal that we had received was to use it in transporting prisoners
367801 if this thing has any life still in it i guarantee ill take care of it
367802 this is an option obviously that is a lot more suitable for either dangerous animals or for dangerous prisoners not for normal flying customers
367803 youve served in air marshal service for three years is it inconceivable that this would actually be seriously considered
367804 but then again i worked for three years for the tsa transportation security administration as a federal air marshal and ive seen some outrageous things so i wouldnt put it past them
367805 weve been able to use dna evidence in the past to identify suspects but this case represents the first time weve worked top to bottom as a cold hit team to bring a suspect to justice
367806 this is our baby this is our granddaughter we loved her very much i also want to put a plea out to the person who hit her please turn yourself in do whats right
367807 super junior happy will bring to the fans a refreshing performance of pajama party with tecktonik pajama dance and the songs cute lyrics
367808 move sh t get the f ck out of the way
367809 were very excited to have people come and take a look at nasas history
367810 weve been able to take a wide range of material and weave it into a virtual tour that allows people to explore at their own pace
367811 it represents a new communications medium for us and we have been fortunate to get the support of a lot of people that has enabled us to include some recognizable historic figures as part of this interactive commemoration
367812 there are not good terrorists and bad terrorists we need to eliminate terrorism
367813 so today august 2 2008 i would like make quick mention of how this practice came about
367814 promote the diversity and individuality of the artists working in this flagship space the center of the sowa art district
367815 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest were having fun and enjoying it
367816 a adapta o exata da forma dos ossos foi um verdadeiro desafio
367817 em muitos pa ses da regi o h um acesso m dio universal aos servi os e tratamentos m dicos para pacientes com hiv realmente eu os parabenizo s o uma inspira o para outras regi es do mundo porque demonstram que isso poss vel
367818 o mundo possui hoje os meios de prevenir os novos casos de infec o de reduzir a doen a e a mortalidade associada ao hiv e de atenuar os efeitos nefastos da doen a entre as fam lias as comunidades e as sociedades
367819 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how the red sox have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
367820 i am delighted to be launching our 100th branch within 19 months of commencing national operations we hope to expand our network in india to over 200 branches by december 2008 making our geographical expansion plans one of the most aggressive in the indian life insurance industry
367821 no one on earth believes in the possibility of an acquittal
367822 others from president clintons team are in a hurry to see me dead
367823 the offer was as follows i must withdraw not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena
367824 holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
367825 its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
367826 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
367827 mr holbrookes wish for my disappearance is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
367828 bibi is likely to be prime minister after the next elections
367829 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
367830 but its impossible to predict whats going to happen there are too many variables
367831 has a prime ministerial aura and experience in executive positions precisely what livni lacks
367832 who the fuck does he think he is whos the fucking superpower here
367833 as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated until a new israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace
367834 savvy politician mindful of the sound bite and always ready to use it he tended to impress and befriend his interlocutors often by stretching or hiding part of the truth
367835 netanyahu believes that the economic sphere is one where we can make quick tangible progress create more jobs and generate growth
367836 that may yield the kind of political payoffs that could further political negotiations
367837 but bibi may in fact be more sane on this issue than mofaz or barak
367838 we had one decapitation some time ago but nothing like this
367839 i dont even know how many times i stabbed her
367840 it was more than once i only stopped when she was dead i had to get rid of the body quickly the only way out was to cut her up wasnt it it was just like cutting a piece of meat
367841 we dont have any information yet about what exactly what she was doing here in brazil
367842 but she knew lots of brazilians from london and she always said that she would like to live in brazil because of the weather london is much colder than it is here and she was curious
367843 he is a drug user and he was always under the effect of drugs and he became very aggressive
367844 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
367845 i dragged her body into the bathroom then i put the body to one side and i got into the shower and washed then i locked the apartment and went out to the party
367846 she doesnt seem like the kind of girl who would have died without a fight
367847 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before
367848 this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
367849 the original idea was to invite the international community to china share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighbourhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
367850 my fathers generation fought and lost for ideology many of them lost their lives because they wanted a just society but now we put up with shit like this
367851 to me it is not a choice of whether or not to speak out it is a matter of dignity of life
367852 from whatever direction you look at it you share the power there is no decoration the concept looks simple but it provides the best watching experience for everybody because there are no pillars
367853 i dont criticise the stadium i criticise the governments use of the olympics for propaganda i am disappointed that the system is not able to turn this historical event into political reform
367854 i have become more political after the article in the
367855 i speak out because i trust chinese people and also because i trust people in government want to make a better society i dont see them as enemies
367856 this year people both inside and outside the party have understood the problems more clearly it is so obvious that it cannot go on any more there is much more talk about the need to be open
367857 it looks like china is becoming more distant from the rest of the world but actually it is becoming closer before we lacked communication and it seemed everything was all right but the olympics is a wonderful thing for china it shows all the problems the chinese government are very willing to learn from it
367858 to show your weakness is power you dont need to pretend no one is perfect in this world telling people the old system is not working is not shameful we all know that
367859 it is the same for the outside world for a long time there was a lack of communication so there are a lot of clich s about china that are outdated but before they find something else they can relate to they have nothing else to use
367860 i am sure some journalists agree with me but they know it cannot be published
367861 when anybody is denied freedom of expression it is a loss for the whole society
367862 we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
367863 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy
367864 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges

367900 in pole position vedo il manchester united seguita sempre in prima fila dallinter di mourinho
367901 ronaldo tevez e rooney garantiscono un centinaio di reti io sono innamorato di rooney e bello vederlo rincorrere il proprio difensore fino alla bandierina e il prototipo del campione moderno
367902 tutti dal presidente massimo moratti allultimo dei magazzinieri hanno un solo obbiettivo in testa la champions
367903 lasciamo lavorare mourinho un grande allenatore linter dovr cercare di organizzarsi velocemente linfortunio di materazzi un brutto colpo in pi ci sono tanti interrogativi il ginocchio di ibra i recuperi di cordoba e samuel mourinho pu vincere la champions se avr a disposizione i suoi giocatori pi importanti linter al completo fortissima
367904 mi piace la scelta di guardiola in panchina barcellona vuol dire qualit possesso palla gioco corto il calcio di guardiola e partito ronaldinho che per ancora un campione integro il barcellona dovevav venderlo il milan ha fatto bene ad acquistarlo ronaldinho sar una delle stelle del ostro campionato
367905 schuster molto preoccupato ha detto che il real forse ha perso troppo tempo in questa trattativa potrebbe lasciare un segno negativo a livello psicologico ora pensano a van der vaart che non cristiano ronaldo
367906 nedved del piero camoranesi hanno locchio vispo quando i vecchi stanno bene vuol dire che in famiglia tutto fila liscio la juve bella tosta amauri una bomba e poulsen sar una delle rivelazioni della stagione la juve torner a spaventare leuropa del calcio
367907 che insieme a gilardino former una delle coppie pi micidiali prandelli ha una bella macchina solida da corsa con alcuni giovani di grande futuro penso a montolivo la fiorentina sar una delle mine vaganti del torneo
367908 con mutu sarebbe stata perfetta ora capisco i dubbi di spalletti nellindividuare unalternativa al campione rumeno ma la roma resta comunque una delle squadre da finale di champions soprattutto se risolver velocemente il problema aquilani
367909 francesco un fenomeno nessuno al mondo riesce a guarire come lui e con il miglior totti la roma sale nel gruppo delle squadre da secondo fila insieme alla juve al barcellona al bayern monaco
367910 sono moderatamente soddisfatto dice il presidente sulla carta un buon sorteggio ma attenti a non abbassare la guardia in campo europeo non c mai nulla di certo ed i sorteggi vanno poi verificati sul campo loro hanno uno stadio di 15 000 posti che sar sicuramente pieno e quindi per noi un match non facile in casa loro anche come atmosfera
367911 sono molto contento sorride il direttore generale perch io ed il presidente presenti al sorteggio abbiamo portato fortuna da qui a dire per che un turno facile ce ne vuole lalbania un paese in continua evoluzione calcistica e in casa loro i match non sono mai una passeggiata inoltre hanno dimostrato contro gli sloveni nel turno precedente di essere pericolosi anche in trasferta considerato il successo per 2 1 e una societ che lavora bene con una squadra giovane di buone prospettive sulla carta resta un buon sorteggio ma bisogna sempre giocarsela

367923 the key is to try to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california

367927 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
367928 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
367929 everybody is jumping to the conclusion that because this guy committed suicide he must be the anthrax killer
367930 that is a lousy premise the pressure of these f b i investigations on individuals is phenomenal and it is quite likely that this guy cracked under that pressure but had nothing to do with the killings

367933 he turned himself in and confessed to murdering his sister to cleanse his familys honour because she disappeared from home for four months with a man
367934 he killed her the moment she returned home last night but forensic tests showed that the girl was a virgin
367935 at the end of the day the first answer is capitalism rightly understood that is to say free markets private property the spirit of entrepreneurialism and the conviction that the fruits of your labors are your own

367949 his strength was really more powerful than my weakness at one time i truly believed that not even the maker of heaven and earth could break the cycle of defeat i was in i was wrong just in case youre thinking something similar stick with jesus long enough to discover that youve been wrong about yourself too he desires to do more with your life than your mind has ever conceived and when you give him full reign over your future nothing absolutely nothing in your past can render it null and void im living proof of that you can be too

367953 its not important that he was a prisoner of war but that he was in the military for a large amount of years which basically means that he has a more experienced outlook on our national defense obama doesnt know anything about war nor about national defense which is why he is inadequate in that sense

367988 americas sole survivors such as jason hubbard have served this nation honorably and suffered deep family tragedies
367989 congress has made a lot of changes to the benefits available to separating servicemen but no law has been passed on behalf of sole survivors
367990 the hubbard act rectifies this oversight and honors the patriotic service and enormous sacrifice of the hubbards
367991 what burns me is that the trees were healthy they cut them without even asking us
367992 this person probably didnt realize that shooting would create heat
367993 the iaastd encourages us to take up what can be called a paradigm change the status quo today is no longer an option we must develop agriculture that is less dependent on fossil fuels favors the use of locally available resources and base research efforts on intensification of natural processes such as using natural fertilizers and protecting soil and water supply
367994 in spite of this article i continue to believe that we can find a positive solution to the multiple crises bearing down upon us
367995 lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world
367996 i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter even the spirit of truth
367997 ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
367998 repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
367999 the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word
368000 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith
368001 that god may give the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
368002 are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit
368003 strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man
368004 all lowliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love

368006 sing and make melody in our hearts to the lord
368007 have i known the indwelling and the filling of the holy spirit that god wants me to have
368008 is it my great study to know the holy ghost dwelling in me so that i may help others to yield to the same indwelling of the holy spirit and that he may reveal christ fully in his divine saving and keeping power
368009 lord i have all too little understood this i have all too little manifested this in my work and preaching
368010 the first duty of every clergyman is to humbly ask god that all that he wants done in his hearers may be first fully and truly done in himself
368011 oh god i have given myself to be filled here i am an empty vessel trusting and expecting to be filled by thee
368012 my god thou art faithful i have entered into covenant with thee for thy holy spirit to fill me and i believe thou wilt fulfill it
368013 my god i have given myself up to thee it was thine own grace that led me to christ and i stand before thee in confidence that thou wilt keep thy covenant with me to the end i am the empty vessel thou art the god that fillest all
368014 the first duty of every clergyman is humbly to ask of god that all that he wants done in those who hear his preaching may be first truly and fully done in himself

368719 we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
368720 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations
368721 so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees

368742 there certainly is a presumption that people self censor to some degree

368760 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
368761 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors

368774 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way

369064 was bjorn asbrandsson and he was a famous warrior besides being a great poet to boot like all wanderers from iceland although he was somewhat drunk he managed to improvise some highly skilful verses in king haralds honour in a metre known as toglag this was the latest and most difficult verse form that the icelandic poets had invented and indeed his poem was so artfully contrived that little could be understood of its content everybody however listened with an appearance of understanding for any man who could not understand poetry would be regarded as a poor specimen of a warrior and king harald praised the poem and gave the poet a gold ring
369065 once upon a time atalanta went too far astray looking for apples and gathered far too many to digest or to carry so had to content herself with sitting on a hill shed made of them just so she could see where she was and find her way back
369066 epistemologically environmentalism is correspondingly badly placed to constitute a core form of knowledge for any substantial section of the public
369067 at its best the art of reviewing conducts a civilized and engaging conversation with the poet and with readers who are curious about how poems are put together why some succeed and others fail above all reviewing demands the exercise of informed judgment and that requires knowledge analytical power style fairness not short sound bytes or pompous pronouncements
369068 this is so much the age of anthologies that it is surprising that poets still waste their time on books of verse instead of writing anthologies in the first place if you are about to print a book of poems dont make up a few names and biographical sketches with which to punctuate your manuscript change its title to poems of democracy and you will find yourself transformed from an old pumpkin always in the red to a shiny black new coach for the average reader knows poetry mainly from anthologies just as he knows philosophy mainly from histories of philosophy or textbooks the complete someone hundreds or thousands of small type double column pages of poetry without one informing repentant sentence of ordinary prose evokes from him a start of that savage and unreasoning timidity that horror vacui with which he stares at the lemmas and corollaries of spinozas ethics those cultural entrepreneurs the anthologists have become figures of melancholy and deciding importance for the average reader of poetry a man of great scope and little grasp who still knows what he likes in the anthologies
369069 in our immediate life there is no longer a place for music
369070 when i first encountered weblogs in 1999 i immediately thought they were a wonderful venue for thinking out loud here was a personal yet public space to hash out ideas and pose questions for the shy undergraduate without the confidence to stick up her hand in front of her classmates or to step into a professors office an act that requires a lot of chutzpah there are no venues for scholarly communication other than the requisite essay and the exam im currently of the belief that we should never ask an undergraduate to read something without also asking her to write something weblogs can be a venue for that kind of regular contemplative thought and critical writing this is a venue that can be easily monitored by tas instructors other students in the class subject librarians guest lecturers interested faculty and graduate students or even the authors of the weeks readings since weblogs come equipped with tools so that any visitor can comment on any post this means a students tentative thoughts can be heard encouraged engaged challenged and commended by those around her students ideas can inform the direction of the class week by week even if they dont have the confidence to open up their mouths and explore a new idea in the classroom this kind of social software can be used not only to encourage thoughtful and regular writing but also to help turn a classroom into a community to help build relationships between students as well as students and their instructors
369071 its a problem that comes from living and reading in the dominant linguistic culture we write a lot we english speakers in canada the states the uk ireland australia new zealand and south africa and thanks to the americans and the british before them were terribly effective cultural imperialists which means italians and eritreans and saudis have a tendency to want to read stephen king and margaret atwood in their languages in a way that we simply could not be bothered to do with their writers

369077 it is sometimes said with heavy tones of lamentation tha t in this day and age everyones a poet the criticism in poetry this a reference to kleinzahlers now famous trashing of garrison keillors good poems collection in that journal implies that on the contrary everyones a critic and criticism is too often the sound of a gripe and the taste of sour grapes expressed with all the sensitivity and thoughtfulness of a midnight blogger
369078 you know of course that it was not apples but oranges in the story of atalanta
369079 the apples of the hesperides cannot be positively identified but the phrase makes it clear that new kinds of fruit were being imported into greece proper from outlying areas even from as far west as spain we have some evidence here for l fast sea transportation since fruit rots quickly 2 for other strains of fruit being produced in the west mediterranean basic strains not found in the east and 3 for a specific kind of fruit so striking in its appearance that a shrewd male phobic girl could be taken in by their striking appearance one thinks of oranges found since the fifteenth century in spain which produced a striking impression when first imported into central europe and were not eaten but reserved as the playthings of bishops and royalty
369080 the apple evidently excited homers particular admiration he in fact made it his representative fruit that it should have been so considered in the north where competition or the place of honour was small is less surprising and apples accordingly of an etherealised and paradisaical kind served to restore youth to the aging gods of asaheim
369081 with the exception of the grapefruit and other recent hybrids the members of the citrus family are native to southeast asia and were first cultivated in india our word orange comes from the hindi china and japan but it wasnt until the middle ages that the lemon and in the 15th century the orange made it to the west where they were initially treated as ornamentals and spice plants

369088 much of european industry has so far come out relatively unscathed
369089 the banks risk models which try to put a value on how much they should realistically expect to lose in the 99 of the time that passes for normality draw on reams of historical data but this can produce a false sense of security

369091 a lot of what i did today were lessons i learned from her
369092 he played with a lot of emotion this week its been a very very rough week for him
369093 hes kept his focus and played baseball and i think its been a good release for him
369094 he has three plus pitches and he had good command of them all
369095 he pounded the strike zone and made us chase hes definitely one of the better pitchers weve faced all year
369096 hopefully well get the offense going to have the chance to give the guys at the back end of the bullpen some days off
369097 i wish i can explain it or someone can explain that to me
369098 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
369099 he was the first back when we started camp who was finishing runs running all the way through runs he makes tatum bell and those guys pick their game up
369100 great vision great balance great size and speed thats what makes great backs
369101 his approach to how he comes out here and plays and practices and goes to meetings thats what we need thats the level of professionalism were looking for from him
369102 the thing i told him is dont let that change when things settle in and you start making money and things become mundane
369103 now we havent tackled to the ground yet we never fully know until you start to see that he seems like the real deal hes got great fundamentals i cant wait to see it
369104 were running guys in and out and getting some good work
369105 when they put me in with kitna for the first time in mini camp i was spooked
369106 everything was going so fast he was talking so fast what do i do it was tough
369107 now to me going with jon i have the same comfort as if i go with dan orlovsky or drew stanton
369108 that just shows me how much faith my quarterback has dont do me like that compare me to emmitt before i touch a ball in a preseason game let alone a regular season game it makes me feel a little more comfortable
369109 its normal team work but its going to be a lot of situations
369110 all the areas we need to look at well touch
369111 we just want to be in all parts of the field all down and distances
369112 say a guy gets an injury that backups got to be ready
369113 i still think i can help the team in a big way
369114 if i was unable to help the club get outs
369115 otherwise you dont say anything you try and be effective
369116 there were days i had no business being out there but i was still getting people out
369117 but now my role has changed ive got to be a couple inning guy if im not doing that im not helping the club youve got to look at the big picture sometimes
369118 its been quite a while hes rusty and he needs to pitch
369119 we did a good job of getting on base and not a very good job of getting home
369120 unless youre issuing seven eight nine walks yourself youre supposed to win those games
369121 the ball hit the catwalk and dropped down no doubt in my mind you could tell the way the ball reacted and the way they outfielders reacted
369122 his pitch count was up a bit but he was fine
369123 they had some good at bats i made some mistakes but they also hit some good pitches
369124 the cdc report demonstrates once again that the numbers on aids in the u s simply dont add up

369137 i was hoping to be at pleasantville for a long time
369138 theres no different mind set at all it just happens i dont go in there with a different mentality im just trying to get three people out
369139 its just kind of an unusual year closers are usually at their best in save situations a lot of times when you bring a closer in to get work that doesnt work out so well but in a tie game in a sense it is kind of a save situation
369140 last night we didnt hit our pitching was excellent to win games you have to put everything together

369149 more efficient mechanism for ensuring that safeguard requirements can be met
369150 as with other safeguards agreements between the agency and member states the agreement is of indefinite duration there are no conditions for the discontinuation of safeguards other than those provided by the safeguards agreement itself
369151 naturally as with all safeguards agreements this agreement is subject to the general rules of international law therefore the agreement should be read as an integral whole
369152 this is important not only for us in bilateral relations but for the world
369153 there is time on the clock and we hope to take advantage of it
369154 this is something we have wanted to do for a very long time mainly because major retailers come to us and want to be part of coolsprings galleria and we have not had space for them said mall

369181 findings are exciting because they show for the first time that oxytocin facilitates the encoding of positive social information over social information that is either neutral or negative
369182 the findings from guastella and colleagues provide new evidence about a chemical system in the body that may help us to connect socially to other people one could imagine that our ability to recall a particularly happy face at the end of a day full of social contacts could reflect an action of oxytocin
369183 oxytocin enhances the encoding of positive social memories in humans
369184 this finding demonstrates the power of environments to trigger relapse to alcohol seeking in response to alcohol predictive cues
369185 this effect is highly detrimental to humans who are trying to abstain from drinking
369186 it is possible that exposure based therapies could occur in a broader range of contexts so as to enhance their effectiveness these contexts could be real i e visiting bars or liquor stores could be created using virtual reality techniques or could simply be recreated by patients as they imagined visiting places that triggered their urges to drink

369193 i have a history of doing these songs where i incorporate the names of labels famous people or animals like i did on animal planet
369194 this time im speaking about cars but im speaking about them in a whole different fashion i start the song off by saying i took her off the floor no money down im talking about a female but im comparing her to a car im not talking about how much my rims cost my soft leather seats the tvs in the headrest and all these things that really have no value or meaning to me
369195 i never focus on what people are listening to or what other guys are doing
369196 since day one its always been about lyrics so i never go into the studio with the idea of making a club song or a radio song or something that females will like it just has to come naturally
369197 its something that people will enjoy and will love to have its needed
369198 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai

369202 we need to identify these people and weed them out
369203 that would spell danger to pakistan in the long run they america want to make us subservient to india
369204 the isi is under the policy directive of the man who calls the shots
369205 it may not be the prime minister it may not be the president but the army chief is always kept in the loop
369206 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
369207 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
369208 its a very disciplined organization but with a very large freedom of action
369209 when they get a policy directive they have certain room for manoeuvre keeping the interests of the state in view
369210 the pakistan army is like a woman with multiple lovers she has to satisfy them all
369211 the clients have their own agenda and room for manoeuvre its a very very murky relationship and the attacks in pakistan show that many operators have gone rogue
369212 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organization on pakistani soil
369213 but the general assumption in washington is that a mixed and unreliable ally is better than no ally at all

369371 no one disputes a presidents ability to withdraw or revise an executive order
369372 but modifying or even throwing out a published executive order without any public notice is a way of secretly changing the law and since the executive order stays on the books congress and the public are misled about what the real law is this bill is an important step toward stemming the growth of secret law in the executive branch

369399 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
369400 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
369401 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal

369440 i havent done anything that most people physically probably couldnt do i just found a niche where i could do something that not many other people wanted to do
369441 i thought this isnt particularly easy but it doesnt bother me any so im going to do it longer and harder than anybody else and see what happens
369442 thats probably the worst race i ever ran in my life
369443 i was running well winning a lot of races but i knew something wasnt right
369444 you cant equate for being born and raised and trained at that altitude or higher
369445 they didnt even say anything to me and that wasnt like tommie
369446 didnt then dont now if they want to go outside the village and do all the protesting they want to do fine but the olympics as the stage for your protest is not proper

369452 thats a storybook ending right there manny getting traded here and coming up representing the winning run
369453 but brandon made some quality pitches and got the double play hes done his job pretty well all year
369454 i was just trying to see the ball and hit it he made a good pitch and got me out
369455 a lot of defense is attitude effort and preparation if you have good athletes it makes it easier defensively for us it will be easier to put a defense on the field than getting all the offensive players that you need it has taken us some time to get the weapons we needed
369456 were we better when we had eight nine starters back
369457 we are going to move the football i promise you that
369458 we are going to use him in a lot of different ways
369459 we will flex him out try to match him up so we can get him on a linebacker or a safety he will be able to be a much better receiver
369460 the last thing to come is changing the mindset of winning that is how all turnarounds have happened
369461 we have been on the threshold i cant tell you how many times we understand this is a new year and a drastically different team we are very focused on what our task is at hand
369462 the defense even with pac 10 tackles leader spencer larsen and jim thorpe award winner antoine cason still only managed to rank seventh in the league in points allowed per game at 26 8 and was fifth in total defense allowing 372 2 yards per game
369463 you get some butterflies but once you take that first hit youre ready to go
369464 i was always a shy and reserved person who just wanted to work hard and stay in the background
369465 theres no need to talk when youre a good athlete
369466 half of my teammates were mad at me so i said its better not to say anything
369467 from the rooftop you can see the moonlight high above the clouds just enough light to see your face
369468 im wrong and i know what it takes to make it right

369474 now from his pocket quick he flashes the crayon on the wall he slashes deep upon the advertising a single worded poem comprising four letters
369475 it was really just to clean it out and make sure we could try to alleviate the swelling and the soreness
369476 this gives him a chance to really get the bulk of reps
369477 we just have to be careful now that we dont wear him out
369478 i feel good because i know all my plays i feel like i can play my role on this team
369479 coming into camp i was expected to be a backup and i was comfortable with that being a starter i did that last season so its all the same to me really
369480 you get used to a guy whether its al or lyle
369481 its more mental or anything but its always nice to have the same guy
369482 he played quite a bit last year we need al in there but i think lyle provides a great backup he has proven he can go in there and make the calls and be a good center
369483 a lot of what i did today were lessons i learned from her
369484 he played with a lot of emotion this week its been a very very rough week for him
369485 hes kept his focus and played baseball and i think its been a good release for him
369486 what have i got to lose except 10 00 right
369487 thats the best hes thrown it really since he came out of the rotation
369488 i rode it out for as long as i could
369489 i played sloppy in my last match everyone was tired but thats not an excuse
369490 i just didnt hit the shots i needed to hit
369491 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
369492 and kobe takes on the challenge of guarding their best perimeter player regardless of who it is regardless if hes a point guard 2 3 4 whatever it is
369493 he had a great game against us a few years ago and was real brash about it
369494 so its my responsibility to bring it to him this is what i do i knew prior to it and they reminded me of it so sic the doberman on him
369495 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
369496 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
369497 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
369498 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
369499 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
369500 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
369501 we have already stressed to him that his citizenship is of the utmost importance he understands that anything less than exemplary behavior will not be tolerated
369502 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
369503 because it would be pretty scary if it got a little panicky and some spectator or some of the golfers were too close that wouldnt have been an issue if a caddie had gotten too close
369504 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
369505 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
369506 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
369507 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
369508 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
369509 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
369510 well see what the doctors have to say when they actually want him to go
369511 hes right on schedule in terms of practicing and running and when we want the live work in a game whether it will be preseason week three or week four well see
369512 it doesnt look like its going to be a good one but well wait and see but anticipate that hes not going to be playing much football this year
369513 i see a lot of great fighters in this game that only got one opportunity and you worry about that i know theres not too many more opportunities so the one that ive got im going to capitalize off of it
369514 i had one of my guy friends over he was hiding in the kitchen
369515 and when the ocean came between them they would build a boat and row and fire flares along the coastline and draw their dead from the fallen snow
369516 cocaine and bourbon pinball and pool look in on me dont leave me to face the slow death of a fool look in on me because time will untie the ties that bind but not if im yours and you are mine

369523 what have i got to lose except 10 00 right
369524 the asking rate for an ad spot on dd1 which will telecast the inaugural and finale ceremonies is around rs 60 000 while the rates for spots during the highlights are rs 10 000 and rs 20 000 however brands who buy commercial time on dd sports will be given free commercial time on dd national and dd news
369525 however since the property is relatively less expensive and given the downturn in the economy brands that have low ad budgets or have cut down on their budgets may eventually pick up a few spots
369526 nothing sells like cricket and indias low key performance in the past is also a cause for the lukewarm response therefore our strategy is to reach out to all television households irrespective of the revenues the property may or may not generate
369527 hij stak zijn medepassagier zeker vijftig keer en daarna onthoofde hij hem
369528 achteraan zat een dertiger die niemand tot last was en haast niet opviel tot de man plots opstond en een groot jagersmes tevoorschijn haalde
369529 de dader bleef volkomen onverstoord inhakken op zijn slachtoffer ik was de laatste die buiten was hij had ondertussen zijn slachtoffer onthoofd
369530 de chauffeur en ik zijn met ons volle gewicht tegen de deur gaan leunen omdat we vreesden dat hij nog slachtoffers ging maken de moordenaar ging terug naar achteren om het hoofd van het slachtoffer te halen hij hield het fier omhoog en liet het dan zomaar op de grond vallen
369531 tel het maar na ik hoor tot de vlaamse artiesten met de meeste optredens op jaarbasis onlangs publiceerde een journalist een overzicht waar ik niet in voorkwam ik liet hem prompt weten dat hij zijn huiswerk niet goed had gemaakt
369532 hou het maar eens in de gaten het zijn altijd artiesten van dezelfde platenfirma die genoteerd staan ik verkocht van mijn vorige album 6 000 exemplaren maar ik haalde de hitlijst niet
369533 een telefoontje van jos van oosterwijck met de melding dat ik in tien om te zien mag optreden ik bewaar leuke herinneringen aan dat programma tijdens de eerste seizoenen werden we belaagd door dolenthousiaste fans dat was een openbaring
369534 ik hing drie seconden aan een hek en kreeg daarvoor drie maanden stadionverbod en 250 euro boete dat is toch overdreven
369535 begin februari kreeg ik een brief van de voetbalcel ik kreeg drie maanden stadionverbod en een boete van maar liefst 250 euro ik gedroeg me helemaal niet agressief tegenover de thuissupporters ik was gewoon blij met de goal
369536 met een geldboete kon ik nog leven maar die drie maanden stadionverbod dat nooit ik kom al heel mijn leven jaar naar antwerp kijken ik ben nog nooit in relletjes betrokken geweest en dan zon zware straf was een stadionverbod of een boete alleen niet voldoende
369537 ik wist niet dat ik niet aan een hek mocht hangen in alle stadions wijzen bordjes erop dat het verboden is het veld te betreden pas in de rechtbank hoorde ik dat het hek deel uitmaakt van het veld daar mag je dus niet op
369538 in feite zijn we sinds de aanstelling van de onderhandelaars niet n millimeter vooruitgegaan
369539 we gaan ons niet laten opjagen ook niet wanneer straks honderden mensen in een bouwkraan kruipen of een hongerstaking beginnen
369540 ik durf al eens met eddy in discussie te treden
369541 met sneeuw is het begonnen ik ben een winterliefhebber het eerste woordje dat ik ooit als zoekopdracht heb ingegeven was winterverwachting dat was een tegenvaller er bestaan geen adequate voorspellingen voor een heel seizoen dus ben ik zelf zoveel mogelijk data beginnen sprokkelen om zelf een voorspelling te maken ik kan nu in het beste geval tot twaalf dagen ver kijken verder niet een accurate voorspelling voor een heel seizoen zal wellicht nooit lukken mij niet maar ook iemand anders niet
369542 het eerste wat ik s morgen doe is opstaan mijn lenzen indoen of nee opstaan mijn computer opzetten en mijn lenzen indoen
369543 zij is blij dat ik haar kan vertellen wanneer het veilig is om de was buiten te hangen
369544 voor de sneeuw en voor het poollicht ik werk aan een model om de verschijning ervan te voorspellen die lappen begrijpen er niets van maar ze beseffen wel dat ik met mijn site bijdraag aan het toerisme in hun land toen ik er de vorige keer kwam zei er eentje tegen me ah ben jij ruben een andere wilde met me op de foto ze beginnen me daar te kennen
369545 ik denk niet dat het te maken heeft met nieuwe muggensoorten of agressievere insecten
369546 wat is er sinds mensenheugenis nog nooit gebeurd een jonge vrouw liet geen wind in de schoot van haar man
369547 welk dier loopt op zijn vier voeten in de morgen op twee voeten in de namiddag en op drie in de avond de mens hij gebruikt handen en voeten als baby loopt rechtop als volwassene en gebruikt een stok als hij oud is
369548 de mens neukt nog liever dan een ezel het enige dat hem tegenhoudt is zijn geldbeurs
369549 ze liggen al 7 8 jaar in alle supermarkten en in veel nachtwinkels
369550 wij zien geen spectaculaire stijging hier valt het eerder op dat cocktails en schuimwijn weer in zijn
369551 wij houden ons uiteraard aan de wet wij richten bijvoorbeeld geen reclame specifiek op jongeren en schrijven ons vakmanschap drink je met verstand maar we doen ook aan zelfregulering we ontmoedigen de verkoop in automaten wellicht wordt dat binnenkort ook wet
369552 je moet al een geweldige zangeres zijn om exact dezelfde noten op exact hetzelfde moment te kunnen zingen met jaren tussentijd tenzij iemand doet alsof ze zingt natuurlijk
369553 de inbreuk werd reeds vastgesteld op 10 juli 2004 maar tony is pas in 2005 geboren ik begrijp er niets meer van
369554 er is reeds een voorontwerp voor het uitdovend woonrecht en weldra zal alles wettelijk geregeld worden als het parket op deze pv zou ingaan wordt de tweejarige tony veroordeeld en moet hij verhuizen dit is in strijd met het europees verdrag voor de rechten van de mens

369575 we wanted to create a small town on the stage and since lauren and i were the primary players i wanted to put our name in it
369576 it was like a religious experience so intense so much energy i wanted to create a spectacle like that i enjoy bands that create a universe where you can explore all the nooks and crannies of their imaginary world
369577 the trick is not to be a wall of noise we struggle to maintain the balance of loud and quiet

369619 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
369620 i cant testify to the navs high speed handling in the twisties because im not an idiot
369621 well duh high ground clearance good off road tips over easily way to state the obvious frickin rocket scientists
369622 nobody in the history of the world has ever even conceived of making this much less actually made it
369623 weve been playing pretty good baseball and havent really gotten a lot to show for it lately but every team goes through a slide and this is pretty much our first one hopefully well get on a roll and vegas will go through a slide of their own
369624 man that felt good because ive been hitting the ball good but i just had been getting any hits
369625 and then there were a couple of guys on so i got some rbis for the team
369626 i dont think i threw my changeup until the eighth inning
369627 landon powell bro he calls a great game if i shook him off more than once or twice id be surprised
369628 im looking for a fastball and i saw the fastball you have to do something with it
369629 you have to hope to hold it put up a goose egg and give it a chance
369630 if he feeds that ball there kouzmanoff might beat it out
369631 he had the instincts to take it himself and saved us there
369632 all in all it was just about getting into a rhythm
369633 ive been trying to get into a rhythm when i warm up between innings not just throwing to get my arm loose it seems to be working
369634 the powers that be should camp out in front of as headquarters and get this done let the giants own the bay and the as could own the valley it is a no brainer and i agree it would ultimately put great pressure on the kings lots of luck in seeing leadership like that from this city
369635 when i start to explain that to you youll be messing with my speech so you know i can only say that mr d eddie d hes instrumental in my life in more ways than one some ways probably more than mr d even knows himself but he gave me a lot of inspiration and so did coach walsh
369636 to me it was one of the lower moments in my life i was kind of depressed because i was leaving the chargers coach bill walsh he brought me in mr eddie he accepted me
369637 the pressure he could apply from the outside and the push we got on the inside really people forget how good of a defense it was
369638 he was the freak before the freak he was like jevon kearse in that he wasnt especially big i probably weighed more than him fred was quick and he was strong he had natural strength
369639 being paid less than a truck driver at that time you know that makes a difference in life for me
369640 i actually stepped on the other side for a minute breathed in the air looked at it as a rainbow i made it to the other side of the rainbow for me that was the pot of gold it was a different lifestyle for me altogether i felt free to perform once i got there
369641 at that time they were playing the dallas cowboys bill walsh told me they hadnt beat em in awhile it was in the paper and everything about how they had not for me it was a platform for me to prove a point that i still had it and could do it
369642 i started for the chargers was a down lineman played every down
369643 with coach walsh he said im going to use you sparingly for rushing the passer he said he didnt know what my condition was
369644 the first game he said id only play like 10 or 12 plays
369645 you know me i never really looked at it from that standpoint
369646 the thing for me was i loved the game i played it to win and i was a team player i love competition even among my own teammates i liked the thing about challenging my teammates so we could all step up another level
369647 it definitely ranks up there with one of the better moments ive had
369648 and for him to score the winning run its great stuff
369649 im lucky it stayed in the park because it was a bad pitch
369650 i tried to throw the breaking ball down and it stayed up
369651 maybe thats a typical finish for such a well pitched game
369652 having met these guys eight hours ago everybodys been extremely positive
369653 you jump around with those guys i felt like id been here all year we were like little kids
369654 it was all new to me it was very flattering
369655 it sounds like it was time for a change of scenery for both sides
369656 as a father of twin girls im especially pleased to help young women around the world realize that their dreams of being a pro soccer player can indeed come true
369657 we dont have to reinvent everything our job is to help build a local groundswell of support its been a very pragmatic buildup
369658 it could end up being a real smart move for corporate america
369659 were not just soccer girls and soccer moms but soccer dads too we bring a whole family demographic
369660 weve learned a lot not from just the old league but the wnba and lots of other sources we have time to get things right with this relaunch weve got to get it right this second time
369661 the old league failed because it had too much money
369662 they had 57 million to start off and they proceeded to blow most of it in the first year it was a disaster
369663 if you can win support on the local level then you can win nationally
369664 the new league fulfills a dream for most of us to play professionally
369665 we want to show northern california can support a wps team
369666 theyve been keeping it on the down low but were feeling assured its really coming now
369667 certainly ill be having the saumon tartar with the roulade de fromage de ch vre a glass of perrier chilled twist of lime and a fork
369668 baby all the dishes in the sink are dirty and theres no clean pans
369669 baby shes been inside all day she needs the fresh air
369670 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
369671 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
369672 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
369673 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
369674 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall
369675 the message we are sending to the markets is look america is serious about becoming independent of foreign oil
369676 the right to a fair and impartial judge is of particular importance in the present cases
369677 whatever ultimately happens concerning the judge this does not mean these cases go away
369678 it will just take longer to get them to trial however i may seek to have the decision overturned
369679 the policy only stops the dumb terrorists because anyone can cross the border with a clean laptop
369680 companies are starting to keep scrubbed travel computers because there really is no such thing as deleted information
369681 personally i dont travel with a laptop for that reason
369682 you and i rely on the men and women standing at the border to get it right and we need to give them the broad authority they need to do their jobs
369683 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
369684 going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
369685 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
369686 i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
369687 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
369688 al knows that the first amendment does not protect newspapers or their readers from dishonest reporters like cooke blair and kelley
369689 he should know that the proposed shield law is not designed to protect such reporters but instead to protect honest and courageous journalists who sometimes now face prison for doing their jobs by keeping their word
369690 i love al but he is wrong a federal media shield is not about protecting reporters or sources its about protecting the publics right to know
369691 ive hooked seven or eight fish but i havent been able to land one yet
369692 im going to fish here seven days a week before and after work through august
369693 this is probably the most clear decision i think a voter can make
369694 if it doesnt pass well be doing more of the same

369791 despite the rather prurient title cohens memoir is a deeply poignant desperately sad account of a confused directionless adolescent girls free fall into self abnegation growing up affluent in new jersey in the 1980s and smarting from the recent breakup of her parents 11 year old cohen begins to recognize the power her nubile body has over men being wanted becomes her greatest hope once she and her older sister tyler begin living with her father when her mother decides to attend med school in the philippines she latches onto other girls with whom she treks into new york city to bar hop at places like dorians red hand and pick up older eager boys stunningly the father is not alarmed by her early morning absences but seems to encourage her popularity buying her clothes and treating her as a grownup gradually hooking up with boys becomes a need a way to bolster her faltering sense of self worth a litany of dreary sex acts follows with young men she doesnt particularly like and who dont like her regardless of std scares and a college rape the painter mother of one of her boyfriends does initiate her into more intellectual pursuits awakening a redemptive desire to become a writer cohens memoir of a lost childhood is commendably honest and frequently excruciating to read
369792 cohens ultimate ownership of her issues leaves as much of an impression as her openness in putting them out there an important look at the dynamics of female sexual power and promiscuity in general
369793 b rutally honest cohen is not proud of her past she says she is disgusted but this memoir gives readers a forthright look at the addiction of promiscuity highly recommended

369816 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
369817 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about

369880 los pa ses del g 8 han hecho poco para mostrar c mo van a financiar el d ficit de 40 000 millones de d lares usa de la ayuda programable y de la condonaci n de la deuda que el panel para el progreso de frica identific el pasado mes el g8 tiene que presentar ya calendarios claros que perfilen la provisi n futura de la ayuda o que permitan la transparencia necesaria para que se mejore la calidad de la ayuda
369881 el panel da la bienvenida como un necesario primer paso al compromiso de 10 000 millones de d lares usa en apoyo alimentario y a las medidas que aumenten las inversiones en el sector agr cola sin embargo es preciso facilitar m s ayudas para que se aumenten los suministros de alimentos a los ciudadanos del mundo que est n en situaci n de mayor vulnerabilidad a la vez que deben adoptarse medidas inmediatas para aliviar las restricciones a la exportaci n de productos como el arroz
369882 el panel da la bienvenida al compromiso de los dirigentes del g 8 para la conclusi n de un acuerdo global ambicioso y equilibrado en doha en cuanto las negociaciones de la organizaci n mundial del comercio entren en ese per odo crucial todas las partes necesitan entender que los objetivos del desarrollo del milenio se asientan en gran medida en la capacidad del continente para regular sus v as para salir de la pobreza
369883 si se apoya el desarrollo africano el xito del mismo no s lo se va a traducir en beneficios tangibles para sus pueblos sino que asegurar un futuro m s pr spero y seguro para el mundo para los dirigentes del g 8 ayudar a frica a ayudarse a s misma no es una cuesti n de altruismo es una cuesti n de inter s personal suyo

369897 each institution to carefully interpret the legislations language in deciding how to comply
369898 congress is sending a strong message that intellectual property is worth protecting
369899 to lure their victims phishing scams use the name of a known institution such as the irs to either offer a reward for taking a simple action such as providing information or threaten or imply an unpleasant consequence such as losing a refund for failing to take the requested action
369900 the goal of the scams is to trick people into revealing personal and financial information such as social security bank account or credit card numbers which the scammers can use to commit identity theft
369901 typically identity thieves use a victims personal and financial data to empty the victims financial accounts run up charges on the victims existing credit cards apply for new loans credit cards services or benefits in the victims name file fraudulent tax returns or even commit crimes
369902 people whose identities have been stolen can spend months or years and their hard earned money cleaning up the mess thieves have made of their reputations and credit records in the meantime victims may lose job opportunities or may be refused loans education housing or cars

369910 devoted to highlighting the best content from the community of bloggers who write about books
369911 isps are intermediaries they are not in law responsible for what internet users do any more than the post office is responsible for what individuals send in the mail
369912 in fact european law specifically states that they may not be put under a general obligation to monitor the information they transmit
369913 this action undermines this principle and threatens the privacy of internet users in much the same way as if the post office had to open and examine the contents of every letter they carry

369915 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
369916 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
369917 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
369918 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
369919 in this course attendees will receive instruction as to how the extended features of visual basic can be used to overcome difficulties encountered when working with disparate data sources within their organizations
369920 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

369927 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
369928 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
369929 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
369930 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
369931 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
369932 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
369933 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
369934 who are open to doing something on the production side
369935 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
369936 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
369937 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
369938 come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
369939 la primera de ellas que me gustar a mencionar es la caza de brujas a la que me han sometido los medios musulmanes antes incluso de que se diese inicio el conflicto armado en serbia
369940 ya entonces cuando tan s lo hab a v ctimas serbias me llamaban criminal de guerra
369941 los medios de comunicaci n internacionales han continuado esa caza de brujas por lo que es inimaginable para muchas personas que este tribunal me absuelva creo que esto pone en peligro al propio proceso
369942 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
369943 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
369944 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
369945 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
369946 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
369947 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
369948 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
369949 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
369950 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
369951 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
369952 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
369953 every formula which expresses a law of nature is a hymn of praise to god
369954 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
369955 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
369956 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
369957 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
369958 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
369959 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint

369971 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
369972 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

369979 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
369980 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
369981 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
369982 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
369983 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy

369985 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
369986 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
369987 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

369989 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
369990 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
369991 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
369992 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
369993 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
369994 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
369995 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
369996 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
369997 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
369998 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
369999 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
