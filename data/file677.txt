6770003 in which the author obsesses over potshots by amateur critics on amazon com
6770004 you waive your 4th amendment right when you step into the detector
6770005 if you feel we should start searching everybody as they go about their everday lives then rewrite the 4th amendment
6770006 seriously if what you want is so popular you can get the 2 3rds votes needed
6770007 proceeding from the will or from ones own choice or consent
6770008 with your definition of voluntary what forms of free travel are non voluntary
6770009 there are psychological as well as physical violations to consider here
6770010 your arguments about coke fly in the face of much thinking in this area obviously we could find all the smugglers if we just searched everybody routinely even though we have no reason to suspect them for carrying drugs
6770011 we dont want this however in our society nor should we get it by default because we decide to search everybody for bombs
6770012 how would you set the standard so that the right to travel without having to waive other fundamental rights still exists in a meaningful way
6770013 obviously the government county in this case is bound by the constitution but the company responsible for maintaining the roads could do the searches couldnt they
6770014 the bus company has been the target of numerous hijackings so the security of the bus is now controlled by the government
6770015 the security of the bus is now controlled by the government
6770016 those who would trade liberty for a little security deserve neither liberty nor security
6770017 some argue that searching for a bomb is reasonable but clearly searching for other things is not but it s what we end up getting and such a program of search is not reasonable
6770018 secondly the terrorists used 4 planes to kill those people by taking over the controls nothing to do with what was in their luggage of course we don t want bombs in luggage but they are not much more threatening than bombs in any crowded place
6770019 this is not a new concept while indeed if police have a warrant they don t have to ignore what else they see that s in part because they do have a warrant and you are suspected of criminal activity however if the warrant says search the living room then they can t search the bedroom and anything seen there if they do is not admissible
6770020 the law abiding people shall be secure in their effects
6770021 my point here is that people make the case that searching for bombs is a reasonable search under the 4th but searching for other contraband is well established as not
6770022 in barlow s case for example they claim they opened his bag to look at the wires in his led gloves after determining the gloves were harmless what reason was there to go to the other end of his bag dig out his pill bottles pull out the cotton and other pills and search for the pot why is that reasonable
6770023 it doesn t matter that carrying pot on the plane is stupid knowing they are searching as they are the 4th protects your privacy including your illegal activity when you re being stupid it doesn t say the law abiding people shall be secure in their effects the search must meet a reasonableness test which just randomly looking for drugs does not or there must be probable cause and a warrant
6770024 my rights are protected even when i am being stupid
6770025 btw does carrying pot on a domestic flight count as smuggling
6770026 the problem with the implied consent theory is that unlike entering military bases it is specious to suggest that in a country of this size you have other alternatives to travel of course technically they exist though not outside the 48 now that they are moving these searches id checks to passenger ships but get real if you can t fly your movement in this country by modern standards is severely curtailed
6770027 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
6770028 this is not a new concept while indeed if police have a warrant they don t have to ignore what else they see that s in part because they do have a warrant and you are suspected of criminal activity however if the warrant says search the living room then they can t search the bedroom and anything seen there if they do is not admissible
6770029 i would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it
6770030 no not for next week for the next 14 years
6770031 appointed by the home office in june 2007 to provide application support for tracking prolific and other priority offenders through the criminal justice system
6770032 data from the police national computer containing personal information about 33 000 individuals with six or more recordable convictions in the last 12 months names addresses and dates of birth data relating to approximately 10 000 prolific and other priority offenders names and dates of birth but not addresses data relating to all 84 000 prisoners in england and wales names dates of birth and in some cases expected prison release date and date of home detention curfew and drug interventions programme data with offenders initials but not full names
6770033 deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6770034 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6770035 it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6770036 device control policies that enforce assigned permissions to individuals and devices
6770037 it is about putting the eyes of the management team on peoples pcs after all if people know they are being watched they are more likely to think again
6770038 guidance measures such as the payment cards industry directive are successful because they provide effective and comprehensive methodology to protect data and they are enforced
6770039 hospitality employees work extremely hard especially at this time of year and its fair to say the industry is rarely associated with passion or fun for us these results just confirm what we see every day that hospitality workers really do love their jobs
6770040 this tatas withdrawing will create problems for the state not only in the present but also for future in attracting investment

6770043 irreversibly hamper the future industrialisation of the state and could take it back to an age of industrial vacuum
6770044 back to the 1970s when the state witnessed large exodus of industry
6770045 we would have to make a move despite whatever investments had been already made in the project
6770046 i know some of our results have not been very good and i admit some mistakes might have been made by us but all the time our main interest was the betterment of pakistan cricket and we had no other motive in mind

6770059 several hundred individuals known to be involved in or closely associated with violent extremist activity
6770060 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why

6770142 the web 2 0 environment is a dynamic one and we wanted to provide an equally dynamic map of the threats confronting todays web surfers
6770143 the beauty of threat spy is that it captures up to date detailed information on threats shortly after they are blocked this not only provides timely insight into existing new and emerging web based threats it also helps demonstrate the critical importance of real time web scanning
6770144 threat spy allows the public to take a step away from the volumes of data showing the increasing dangers of the web and actually see the malware being blocked every day in different places around the world
6770145 we reported a 278 percent increase in malware in the first half of 2008 and this innovative map visualizes this worrying increase we hope the map will demonstrate how dangerous the threat landscape is and will prompt companies to take action

6770159 the biggest stunt i always say on the indiana jones films was stopping harrison doing the stunts because i had to fight nearly every time to stop him
6770160 i had to rely on a horse and horses have a sense of survival and they dont actually do what you tell them to do as they havent read the script
6770161 it always works better if you do have a relationship with the actor you can mimic how they move how they work when you coordinate fights for them like i did with harrison

6770175 your governments historic commitment to lead on global warming in europe and around the world
6770176 as proposed these conventional coal plants lack any limits on their emissions of carbon dioxide and would drastically increase the uks carbon dioxide emissions and make achievement of your stated pollution reduction goals extraordinarily difficult if not impossible building new conventional plants and setting the uk up to fail and lose its leadership mantle will make our work in the us all the more difficult
6770177 they can adapt to one to two degrees of warming but if its more than that they cant adapt they are just filled with despair

6770185 when the conventions are over will we have more momentum popularity and strategic poise than before they started or will we be caught up in massive state repression with no public support with this in mind lets deepen our roots in our communities this spring so that when we are making headlines at the conventions this summer the people around us know who we are and hear what we want from our own mouths not just the propaganda of the state
6770186 if you challenge the architects of war and poverty they call you a terrorist
6770187 i dont need a newspaper to tell me that but ok
6770188 we will go home to our communities after this summer and it is in our communities that the effects of the broadening ecological crisis the crash of the economy and the implementation of security as a way of life will take hold whether it is the right wing of capital or the left wing of capital capitalism will continue to structure our lives and dissolve every inch of autonomy we carve out to the contrary of the common narrative of defeat and despair we notice that it is also in these communities that our affects take hold it is within these circuits of support both material and emotional that we produce ourselves as powerful

6770270 do you like red velvet cake and if you do why why is it so so special other than the fact that its red
6770271 does it taste like red fruit or something like strawberries or cherries
6770272 nope actually to me it tastes like vanilla cake with a pudding esque flavor with a touch of food coloring
6770273 well do you put strawberry icing or something on it
6770274 nope well technically i guess you could although i dont really know how that would taste usually i ice it with cream cheese icing
6770275 you know rob asked me to make him a red velvet cake for his birthday this year what is the deal with it it doesnt really taste like anything different
6770276 i know i agree matt and i talked about it on the way home today although he has never had it so he really couldnt give me any feedback as to why its a big deal
6770277 well i think that people like it only because its red
6770278 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming
6770279 it was a fantastic race probably the most enjoyable race i have ever had and i am really pleased not just for me but for my coach friends and family who have given me so much support
6770280 mum took me down to the local canoe club when i was 10 and i loved it so much i never looked back

6770288 every year it becomes less and less possible to find an independent bookshop or an independent publisher or an independent minded author and every book is fine tuned to appeal to richard and judys editor or whatever cultural trend is currently riding high in the collective unconscious but what about the writing what place is there in all of this for the difficult edgy elitist experimentation that has to be fostered despite its failure to be accessible or to appeal to a broad audience or make money writing that offends in its desire to be superior that doesnt care if its not liked or understood or marketable where is this work to find a haven when its traditional home the subsidised mid list is being gradually put out to grass and the resources that once paid for it are streamlined into paying for cardboard cutouts and window displays for an ever decreasing number of books there is a failure of will when it comes to resisting the commercialisation of writing where even those who write under the banner of literary fiction feel they have to apologise for stretching their readership and the notion that james joyce is superior to n1ck h0rnby is frowned upon so we come back to the question of what is the writing for james joyce is better than n1ck h0rnby at being literature whether its better at being entertaining is a matter of personal choice but if your notion of being entertained precludes being challenged then perhaps the idea that writing should be ebtertaining is one that needs to be questioned because at the moment it is in the market place almost unassailable and it is suffocating everything in its path

6770306 the chinese government is desperate to turn the worlds attention away from its abuses in tibet as the olympics take place but the creativity and determination of tibetans and their supporters has once again ensured that tibetan voices are heard and seen in beijing despite the massive security clampdown
6770307 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet

6770329 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6770330 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6770331 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6770332 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6770333 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6770334 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6770335 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
6770336 dear community we have some news about our fight with suicidegirls we all sat down together and worked out an agreement that is really fair to everyone we are especially relieved that we can now send people back to suicidegirls com to see all of our early work together without feeling dirty we are so glad to have this whole thing behind us good luck to suicidegirls in the future and look out for their new book coming out this fall that features some great classic lithium picnic photography were really glad to end all the bad blood between us so we can all start concentrating on creating great art instead of fighting over it thanks to everyone that helped and supported i think weve all learned from this experience and hope never to have to go through anything like it again we want to make it clear that we 100 have no hostilities towards suicidegirls in anyway anymore we all came to a really fair agreement over this dispute and there were no bad people here just mistakes and misunderstandings if youve boycotted sg on our behalf you helped us come to this agreement so thank you but the battle is over and were all friends again to help offset our legal expenses when you sign up with suicidegirls please use so that we can use the money to pay off our lawyers and focus on apneas modeling and my photography thanks lithium picnic and apnea

6770357 but the bottom line is that is the system right now that is the style that seems to be applauded in these olympics
6770358 and our guys dont come ready within the confines of that system they dont come ready to deal with that its almost like we have an arrogance like oh were just going to train like we train athletically and pro style and just let if fall the way it falls
6770359 if your aspiration if your intent is just to move on the pros ok but if you want to put a representative u s team in the olympics youve got to do something about it
6770360 i mean all the hard work i was playing catch up so i had to work extra extra hard compared with all the other guys i think i succeeded the results are not what i envisioned but i accept this

6770564 i think hes a man who could be a transformational character
6770565 i think this country needs some re dealing of the cards and he has the willingness to move money around and to help people i think were on a very bad course right now that is hurting an awful lot of ordinary people i dont see anything in john mccains program that makes me think thats going to change but barack obamas got a lot of good ideas on how to do it differently
6770566 he spent the whole time asking me about things a lot about health care a lot about tennessee and anyone who is that concerned and willing to listen to other people i think really has got some of the tools it takes to be a great president
6770567 people are looking for ways to make the transition from an older economy to a more modern economy that would be very true of rural tennessee as well and i just think part of the reason why they asked me to come here is because of the similarities between the two
6770568 i think hes got some huge ideas that could be very beneficial to this part of our country
6770569 he has a huge interest in alternative energy sources and anybody who has followed anything to do with energy knows that coal is going to be a primary supplier of energy for the rest of my life and the rest of my sons life weve got to put money behind things like coal to liquid technology and sequestration to keep coal in that position
6770570 i think his willingness to invest in alternative energy actually will have huge positive benefits on all of the coal producing regions of the nation

6770597 the beauty is that mtn cannot offer the same because their network would crash and inevitably hurt their subscriber base the question however is how sustainable is it can you continue to give free calls what happens when you start charging for the calls which has to happen one day will you see major attrition on your numbers
6770598 mtn zone and its utl equivalent are the smartest thing to happen to the industry but they are not without pitfalls
6770599 essentially mtn is not giving anything away for free instead they are getting more people to call who used not to and in effect making more money
6770600 the more stable predictable income of mtn and utls subscriber base is their corporate clients who though are the minority in relation to the total subscriber base are loyal the pressure is going to be to offer them something as well or the battle will intensify for post paid clients from people like warid

6770635 to think of over 2 000 people being at the silverlands is great
6770636 they have great support and really get behind their lads and we will be hard pushed to make more noise than them
6770637 they get more than some second division clubs it will be a great day for everybody
6770638 they have brought a lot of a new players in i think they might be a surprise team this year it wouldnt surprise me if they were in the top ten
6770639 you just cant look at the table and think that team should be okay or that team should be okay they are all very very tough games it is a good league
6770640 it is the best unibond premier i have seen i thought it was a tough year when i won at harrogate but if you look at it this year youve got teams like boston bradford park avenue fc united nantwich and cammell laird
6770641 i was very impressed with him and have big hopes for him i think he will start for us obviously we have got to keep the pressure on the players
6770642 look at the young lads weve got now theres tom griffiths mark lees and pat mcguire and all three are under 20
6770643 it is terrific to have young players coming through and i will be pleased to nurture them i know were a long way off but look at when fergie alex ferguson had all his young boys and it all came together so why not for us
6770644 wakka is only 22 towey is 25 gregg anderson is 25 its only maxfield and brodie that are over 30 if we keep this team together who knows what could happen in a couple of years time

6770677 a key question related to treatment with curcumin is its poor bioavailability after being taken orally our results also indicated that only low levels of curcumin are detectable in plasma steady state level at day 3 is f22 41 ng ml
6770678 nevertheless some of the patients had biological activity of curcumin as evidenced by the anti tumor effects in two patients and by effects on cytokine levels and on nf nb cox 2 and pstat
6770679 further investigations are needed to elucidate the relationship between the form of curcumin its relative pharmacologic activity and circulating versus tumor tissue levels
6770680 our current study shows that oral curcumin is tolerated without toxicity at doses of 8 g d for up to 18 months although this molecule is poorly absorbed with low nanogram levels of circulating curcumin detected at steady state biological activity is evident preclinical data suggest that curcumin has potent activity against pancreatic cancer but higher levels of exposure need to be achieved

6770683 a new bank holiday would be very popular for britains workers who have fewer public holidays than anyone else in europe except romania but it could also bring in much needed revenue to around a million uk businesses
6770684 so far business lobby groups have stuck to their usual position of opposing anything that benefits staff including a new bank holiday but we urge these organisations to think outside the box and recognise the benefits that a new bank holiday could bring to many of their members
6770685 a community day would encourage more people to take up volunteering for a day in return employers will have a healthier happier and more productive workforce we urge businesses politicians and community groups to join us in our campaign for a new community day bank holiday

6770710 if all mankind minus one were of one opinion and only one person were of the contrary opinion mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he if he had the power would be justified in silencing mankind but the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race posterity as well as the existing generation those who dissent from the opinion still more than those who hold it if the opinion is right they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth if wrong they lose what is almost as great a benefit the clearer perceptions and livelier impression of truth produced by its collision with error

6770721 parents are effectively on the other side of the gates watching on cctv
6770722 the parents thought it was an incredibly positive experience for their kids to go through we were taking them away for two weeks so they were highly monitored
6770723 we wanted to see what happens if the parents were not there
6770724 you are just left with this positive feeling that these kids are wonderful weve got this generation here of brilliant kids if theyre let loose theyre brilliant
6770725 the safety of the kids was absolutely paramount there were security guards chaperones production staff and cctv for the parents
6770726 given how hard adults find it to cope with a series like big brother to put children in that environment is asking for trouble theres a danger this could leave children traumatised
6770727 if its intended to be educational then its a good thing but i dont think it will be
6770728 the big danger is that the producers will have preconceived ideas of what they expect to get from their programme
6770729 they will expect the boys to fight more than the girls be unable to cook and be dirtier and i fear the editing will reflect those ideas rather than be fair and unbiased
6770730 im sure the programme will serve no useful purpose and will simply be voyeuristic and low grade entertainment
6770731 with children aged eight how do you give consent id hope that there was full psychological profiling and full support for the children
6770732 when big brother first came on the scene we were told it was an observational documentary and we would obtain psychological data that it would be a step forward in finding out about relationships you have to be really very deluded to think that were getting that from it now

6770737 the bush administration works toward a troop withdrawal schedule that is more aggressive than mccain envisions
6770738 all troops will be home by 2011 is a myth we will continue to man bases in iraq especially airbases in the kurdish north
6770739 the agreement would link troop reductions to achievement of certain undisclosed security milestones
6770740 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6770741 a mccain term is nothing but a third bush term
6770742 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6770743 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6770744 they are working on a plan that looks lo and behold like the plan that ive been advocating i will encourage the administration to move forward with it
6770745 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalized
6770746 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
6770747 i dont think this gets the issue off the table

6770762 the sultan who inherited the riches of an unbroken 600 year old muslim dynasty has had to cut back on his countrys oil production because of depleting reserves
6770763 as a group the worlds 15 richest royals have increased their total wealth to 131 billion up from 95 billion last year
6770764 because of technical and idiosyncratic oddities in the exact relationship between individual and state wealth these estimates are perforce a blend of art and science
6770765 while we have tracked the fortunes of a few high profile royals like the queen of england and sultan of brunei for years this is only the second time we have published a definitive list of the richest royals
6770766 monarchs of such countries as spain and japan failed to make the cut

6770773 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
6770774 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
6770775 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet under water
6770776 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6770777 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6770778 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6770779 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6770780 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6770781 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6770782 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6770783 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6770784 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6770785 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6770786 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6770787 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6770788 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6770789 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it
6770790 there have been a lot of gunmen joining the pirate gangs they are making good business and it is an attractive choice for many young men at the moment
6770791 we have decided on the makeup of the government and the swearing in will be later today
6770792 we have to be able to give people a sense of good governance
6770793 there is a good feeling about this coalition and we believe it will work we have faith in each other and we believe together we will achieve what we are setting out to do
6770794 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6770795 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6770796 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6770797 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in
6770798 we are not going to sign this memorandum of agreement in its present form
6770799 with due respect to the supreme court government in the executive department would like to make this very very clear and there should be no nuancing about this
6770800 they are going to have to do a sit down to keep a lid on the situation and get a conversation going again they will have to do that relatively soon

6770810 even better luna and i will put ginny to bed neville you and hermione go to the headmasters office and let him know what weve found
6770811 madame pomfrey should have kept ginny overnight what was she thinking
6770812 you cant get her up the staircase to the girls dormitory harry how will you
6770813 lets get her to bed harry shes asleep on her feet
6770814 ginny dont be brave lets just get you to bed
6770815 what is wrong with ginny what have you three been up to where is ron and where are the other two members of your little gang
6770816 were helping ginny up to bed she got burned by something earlier and we had to take her to see madame pomfrey thats whats wrong and what weve been up to i dont have a clue where ron got off to he left us hours ago hermione and neville
6770817 she was burned harry what were you doing that she could have been burned
6770818 percy ill tell you everything the moment the headmaster arrives which he should be doing in just a minute in the mean time im going to take ginny up and put her in bed thats much more important than feeding your pompous attitude
6770819 or at all i really need to lose some weight
6770820 sorry what lose weight neville youre not fat youre just
6770821 im on the chunky side hermione i know how tubby i am
6770822 youre so hard on yourself rather off putting if i do say so myself
6770823 have any idea how to get this thing to open
6770824 miss granger mister longbottom i assume by your presence here just outside my office that you wish to speak to me about something yes how may i be of assistance to two of gryffindors finest
6770825 have you informed professor mcgonagall about the situation she is your head of house after all and thus should naturally be the first person you contact
6770826 yes sir but if we should have gone to professor mcgonagall first
6770827 thats neither here nor there miss granger whats done is done in fact mister longbottom while i accompany miss granger to the site of this horrible thing would you be so kind as to go and fetch professor mcgonagall to wherever it is we are going thank you
6770828 its mrs norris professor something horrible has happened to mr filchs cat someone killed mr filchs cat b but worse than that sir shes been torn apart its almost like shes been in a fight with some larger animal sir theres blood everywhere
6770829 no sir we that is my friends and i ginny harry luna neville and ron we didnt see it happen we were just coming from the hospital wing you see
6770830 the hospital wing why were you in the hospital wing miss granger
6770831 ginny weas i mean ginny potter she got hurt sir burned we neville and i and a few of our friends were well we were playing sir in a large room containing many many objects just scattered about
6770832 miss granger its all right calm down nothing you say to me now will get you or your friends in trouble i assure you im willing to overlook the occasional broken rule in the interests of the school so please do continue your story
6770833 we were in a huge room that harry had found professor it was filled wall to wall with all sorts of stuff all of it was old and most of it looked abandoned or forgotten some of it was broken there were old suits of armor and wardrobes and chests filled with all sorts of books and ron found a flying carpet and we the girls i mean myself ginny and luna we found all sorts of old dresses and gloves and shoes we were playing dress up like we were all knights and ladies in a castle i was the duchess of granger we were all dressed up and playing pretend i guess it sounds sort of childish but we were having fun professor
6770834 now miss granger there is absolutely nothing wrong with children playing games and having fun its a skill i like to think i have not yet lost now that i am settled into old age but please continue i enthusiastically await the climax of this interesting if rambling tale
6770835 sorry professor i suppose we have been getting to the point from the roundabout way while we were playing dress up we came across a crown when ginny went to put it on it burned her hands seriously her skin was blackened and was cracking open so we took ginny to see madame pomfrey healed ginny we came across poor mrs norris after we left the hospital wing
6770836 do you think after we investigate the death of mr filchs cat that you can show me the object in question miss granger
6770837 i think it behooves us to go and examine an object that can burn the hands that hold it but first let us attend to mrs norris
6770838 i got the notice the stairway alarm had been tripped have you identified which boy it was and did it happen accidentally or did the young man in question have a more questionable motive in mind
6770839 i was the person who tripped the alarm though i assure you i did it quite by accident
6770840 however you should know that before i did so harry potter walked up the girls stairs without so much as a fair thee well and the alarm didnt even chirp at him
6770841 it was only after i made to follow him to bring him back down of course that the staircase flattened and the alarm sounded i nearly bit through my lip when i landed
6770842 still up there professor he and that lovegood girl were carrying my sister up the stairs i told him not to but he didnt listen to me maam
6770843 you mean hes how long has he been up there
6770844 it has to have been five or six minutes professor since just before the alarm sounded hell be in the first year dorm maam
6770845 potter really should learn to respect the prefects in this school
6770846 all right everyone its the headmaster make way there let him through you lot
6770847 thank you mister francis if you could have the children step back out of the way please and if you could please send someone to fetch professors snape sprout and flitwick id greatly appreciate it miss granger if you wouldnt mind
6770848 miss granger if you would please which direction were you and your friends coming when you came across poor mrs norris
6770849 we were coming from that direction professor from the hospital wing wed just rounded the corner there when neville shouted he spotted mrs norris first the rest of us were talking i cant really remember about what and neville just stopped and shouted
6770850 harry and ginny both said something about not expecting this to happen i didnt think of it until now but thats slightly odd isnt it
6770851 thats when harry sent neville and me to get you he was taking ginny back to gryffindor tower before she fell over in exhaustion
6770852 i see did harry say whether or not he was coming back
6770853 i think he was more worried about ginny than mrs norris sir
6770854 nothing nothing i apologize miss granger just muttering to myself
6770855 i understand you all are curious and therefore it would be useless to order you all back to your houses but if everyone could please step back a bit farther i would appreciate it
6770856 quite all right youre a normal human being miss granger that means that like most of us you have the one innate quality that separates us from lesser beings a quick and powerful brain powered no less by curiosity than anything else what have you noticed perhaps ive missed something
6770857 oh well um i think mrs norris was killed by an animal of some type and from the size of the bite id say it was big
6770858 but if it was that big howd it get into the castle
6770859 yes filius it is i wish to wait until professors sprout and mcgonagall are here before going to deeply into this but obviously the poor beast was the victim of foul play
6770860 headmaster if i may has anyone located mr filch and told him about his pet
6770861 mister potter what do you have to say for yourself im sure you are aware that the girls dorms are off limits to boys
6770862 ginny got hurt professor madame pomfrey told her to get some rest i helped luna get ginny to her bed thats all
6770863 mister potter your intentions are all well and good but youve broken a rather important rule willingly this will cost gryffindor fifty points and youll serve a week of detentions with mister filch
6770864 professor i hope you can please excuse the interruption but does the rule still apply to married students who are in a room together with or without a third party present
6770865 miss lovegood this matter doesnt involve you so please be still but to answer your question there are no provisions in hogwarts rules for married students thus they must follow the same rules as everyone else
6770866 but professor i am involved in this if harry violated a rule it was with my help i helped harry carry ginny up the stairs
6770867 very well miss lovegood fifty more points from gryffindor and you too will serve a week with mister filch now how did miss weasley get injured
6770868 potter shes not miss weasley professor shes mrs potter remember
6770869 and i mean no disrespect but can we move this downstairs shes asleep and madame pomfrey says she needs her rest
6770870 all right you lot you heard the deputy headmistress clear out find somewhere else to be
6770871 we were playing around with some old junk we found up on the seventh floor it seemed harmless enough the girls were getting all dressed up in some clothes they found while neville and ron and i bogged around ginny picked up this this crown or tiara or whatever youd call it and it hurt her it burned her fingers down almost to the bone madame pomfrey healed the burns and suggested she go rest in her bed for the night
6770872 i see and in all this did you think to tell someone that youd found a dangerous object on school grounds
6770873 we harry and myself that is felt it important to get ginny back here
6770874 mister potter while i admire your devotion to your ahem bride you simply must remember the rules they are there for a reason and they apply to you as well as everyone else now since your reasons were basically sound i will return the fifty points i took from miss lovegood and reduce your own penalty to twenty five but i dont want it happening again
6770875 mister potter another question just what did you do to negate the alarms on the stairs the alarms that prevent male students from climbing into the girls dorms
6770876 i mean climb the first two steps for me mister potter
6770877 mister weasley ronald i mean please head up to your dorm percy please climb the first two steps of the girls dorm stairs for me im trying to make sure they still function
6770878 well i suppose that means they are working though why they arent working for you mister potter is something of a mystery
6770879 prof professor mcgonagall headmaster needs pfreww needs to speak to you maam hes hes at the girls lav on the second floor the one thats always out out of order
6770880 mister potter youre free to spend the rest of the evening as you like your detentions will start tomorrow night you too miss lovegood mister weasley thank you for your assistance
6770881 no you dont i want to hear about everything that went on tonight i want to know how my baby sister got hurt and i want to hear about it right now
6770882 headmaster the man isnt in his office and none of the portraits report having seen him within the last hour is it possible that filch has left the castle for some reason
6770883 ive sent for hagrid and the gamekeepers hut is the only place outside the castle i would think argus would go
6770884 pass the word to the ghosts that i need them have them assemble here as quickly as possible
6770885 mister filch is nowhere in my greenhouses nor did i see any signs of his being there earlier
6770886 thank you for coming your excellency are all the ghosts with you
6770887 the only one that failed to heed my call was the young one myrtle but as she haunts the jakes behind you
6770888 er excuse me please myrtle its the headmaster i need to speak
6770889 una generaci n pasiva que espera tomar el relevo del poder
6770890 contin a siendo joven y a la que le cuesta mucho delegar
6770891 los treinta eros seguimos esperando que alguien pap estado o pap de verdad la vida el mundo o eeuu nos saque de los problemas y nos sit e en nuestro sitio
6770892 no cree en los logros pol ticos ni en la palabrer a sino en la acci n espec fica en las plataformas y en el poder de internet
6770893 esta generaci n desconf a de todo lo que sea institucional
6770894 the chamber of secrets of course i was looking in the wrong place
6770895 you found the chamber you know where the chamber is
6770896 did you find the physical location of the chamber itself or did you simply find more information than has been supplied by professor binns
6770897 oh i found some new information its all here in this book
6770898 according to this each of the four founders of hogwarts constructed a set of private chambers for their own use these rooms were hidden from the rest of the castle and accessible only to the founders themselves and those friends or family members who knew the secret of how to enter them
6770899 this says that when ravenclaw hufflepuff and gryffindor each died they left behind knowledge of how to open their secret chambers and thus the chambers became common knowledge and are used to this day by the school ravenclaws chamber for example is now the location of the schools library while hufflepuffs chamber is part of the seventh year puff dorms now because
6770900 but slytherin left the school before he died didnt he
6770901 he couldnt have revealed where his chambers were hidden or how to open them
6770902 okay so now we know what the chamber of secrets is how do we find it and what about the monster thats supposed to be living in it
6770903 yeah sure i just ran from the third floor corridor i was looking for professor flitwick and was checking some of the classrooms he uses to talk privately to some of the students you know well i didnt find flitwick but i did find percy he was in the office connected to the classroom and the door was open you would not believe what he was doing with that ravenclaw prefect whats her name clearwankle or something oh my god it was disgusting i almost threw up in the corridor and the noises they made
6770904 if thats what a special naked hug looks like forget it
6770905 i dont want to tell anyone i saw anything like that ever
6770906 but hes a prefect he shouldnt be you know doing that in school especially not where just anyone can walk in
6770907 come now hermione its really not our business who percy weasley is having relations with and being a tattle tale is never a good thing on the other hand im sure that ginny feels a need to scrub her brain clean of the images
6770908 look lets change the subject lets talk about what we were talking about all right
6770909 what does enemies of the heir mean anyway heir of what
6770910 after all if its slytherins chamber it makes sense that if someone was opening the chamber and letting the monster out to ravage the school and terrorize the student body it would be slytherins heir
6770911 no its a good one luna i think youre right whoever is opening the chamber of secrets is at least claiming to be the heir of slytherin you just said that so quickly
6770912 the way i see it harry once everyone else in the school figures out what we just did well
6770913 harry remember youre famous on a legendary level right i mean youre not just stubby boardman famous or ludo bagman famous youre well youre
6770914 yeah harry potter famous everyone knows about you or thinks they do something like this happening so close to you its inevitable that sooner or later people are going to start talking about you as if you were the heir himself
6770915 we know harry its ridiculous to even consider that you might be the heir of slytherin but still people will think that dont worry well be there for you
6770916 you know who i think is most likely to be the heir of slytherin
6770917 well ill give you three but youre only going to need one
6770918 he does seem to have the right attitude and hes certainly well practiced at creepy but doesnt he strike you as being just a bit too obvious
6770919 i mean its almost like some invisible writer has made him so slimy and evil that anytime anything happens our first suspicion will be toward malfoy hes too convenient isnt he
6770920 yeah he is a bit obvious and i learned that lesson first year with professor greasy git we all thought he was trying to steal the stone when it was quirrell all the time certified evil but hes still trying to make up for betraying my mother
6770921 yeah he did thats why i hate him even if hes been trying to make up for it ever since
6770922 yeah he does he keeps insisting snapes on our side now but me i think hes just on his side
6770923 but he really truly loved my mother and for that because of that i can forgive him a little for the rest of things i dont like him and i dont trust him not to hurt me but i do trust him not to sell me out to voldemort
6770924 so well keep an eye on malfoy but we wont let doing so blind us to other possibilities
6770925 ron has a detention with mcgonagall im not sure where neville is
6770926 all right were going to start with the reserve keeper try outs whos here for keeper
6770927 good to have you now what well do is have you man the goals one at a time now for the first round were going to have the chasers thats katie angelina and alicia there make a go at scoring on you well then do a round with the chasers doing two on one combinations and finally well be hitting anyone not already eliminated with full raft combinations where all three chasers will be working together to score against you clear okay lets have mclaggan first then weasley then longbottom
6770928 okay you three arent bad on a broom and youll no doubt get better with practice
6770929 being keen on a broom is key to being a great chaser but you also need fantastic timing a good sense of the game around you and the nerve to put yourself out there
6770930 all right you four what we want you to do is do your best to score on oliver there
6770931 remember to be aware of the shooters line you wont be passing so you dont have to worry about the passers line but if you cross the shooters line without taking your go at the goals ill mark it against you
6770932 yes well seeker try outs will be held right after we get done with you lot
6770933 now lets see dean up first followed by ginny then demelza and finally seamus okay good mount your brooms
6770934 alicia katie round up the prospects and put the brooms away well continue this somewhere else flint
6770935 whats all this i booked this field weeks ago so i could run trials for my
6770936 well youll just have to reschedule wood i have a note
6770937 i professor s snape give the slytherin team permission to practice today on the quidditch pitch owing to the need to train their new seeker you have a new seeker
6770938 the latest model a gift from dracos father much better than the old comets id say and as for the cleansweeps
6770939 oh that yeah an anonymous benefactor donated an entire raft of nimbus 2001s to the gryffindor team ravenclaw and hufflepuff got them as well
6770940 at least no one on any of the other teams had to buy their way in
6770941 how dare you speak to your betters like that you filthy little mudblood
6770942 you dont dare touch me my father would ruin your entire family if you so much as raise a finger
6770943 you and your puisne family dont impress me malfoy what are you again twelfth rank youre not fit to shine my familys shoes
6770944 i am neville francis longbottom head of the ancient and most noble house of longbottom i declare hermione granger under my protection and if she is willing her family is sept to the family longbottom
6770945 oh uh on uh on behalf of my parents i uh hermione jane granger accept um
6770946 accept the protection of the longbottom family and agree to be sept to them for as long as my family thrives
6770947 i accept the protection of the longbottom family and on my parents behalf agree to be sept forever
6770948 longbottom on behalf of my housemate who should know when to keep his tongue behind his teeth allow me to extend the deepest apologies of slytherin house to your cousin
6770949 such public displays of rudeness are not fitting a member of slytherin house much less a member of one of the great families
6770950 thank you flint i and thus all of the longbottoms accept the apologies of slytherin house on the behalf of its least member
6770951 something i wanted to discuss do you think our mysterious benefactor could see his way clear to supplying some new brooms for our back up players id like whoever we end up picking to begin practicing with the rest of the team
6770952 i think our mysterious benefactor will see what he can do
6770953 he missed all the three on ones and all but two of the two on ones i blocked all the two on ones and the first three three on ones hows he a better keeper than i am
6770954 well for one thing hes got a better attitude weasley might not be perfect but i can tell hes willing to work on it and doesnt think hes merlins gift to quidditch
6770955 thats bollocks i know what youre really about anyone with a lick of wits can see it
6770956 all right why dont you tell everyone here what i am really about this should be very interesting and i cannot wait to hear it
6770957 you put his girlfriend on the team along with a bunch of his friends
6770958 i put ginny on the team because she flew rings around everyone else on the pitch except harry shes perfect seeker material and i think shed do well as chaser as well i put the others on the team because i see potential that we can work on before they have to jump into a game
6770959 and i didnt put you on the team because you arent a team player youre arrogant and youre bull headed and you refused to listen to me while you were trying out
6770960 yes i know how many goals you stopped doesnt matter i was looking for more than just stopping goals
6770961 im looking for people who can mesh into the team for reservists im looking for people i can train youre quick on a broom but i can tell you arent going to learn anything i want to teach you
6770962 im a better keeper than your friend and you know it i should be on the team and you know it im going to get you for this somehow
6770963 my congratulations to the new reserve players mister wood well chosen i think if mister mclaggan gives you any trouble please refer him to me im not sure i appreciate his attitude
6770964 that word that malfoy used today the one that caused everyone to tense up mudblood what does that mean
6770965 yeah it happens hermione imagine youre in church and someone from outside runs in and shouts kiss my butt into the air before running back out everyone would be appalled but theres always one guy whod start giggling because he cant believe what he heard thats ron right now
6770966 and er malfoy would be the person who wanted the church to kiss his er
6770967 it means dirty blood and its a really foul word used to insult people like you you know muggle born
6770968 malfoy calling you a mudblood is like someone calling pavarti a paki or seamus a mick or dean a ni
6770969 its worse because this prejudice is part of the wizarding world where racism isnt anymore blood prejudice still rules our society
6770970 youre absolutely correct hermione were going to have to do something about that ill help you
6770971 hes a little dog with a big bark but not a lot of bite the only time he ever really hurt anyone was when he ambushed harry on the train that one time right harry

6771034 it is important to elucidate the link between these two diseases
6771035 the prevalence of dementia rises with age doubling every four to five years after the age of 60 so that over a third of people older than 80 are likely to have dementia
6771036 this is the first large study to examine the association between coronary heart disease and cognition
6771037 the major risk factors for chd are cigarette smoking diabetes high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure all of these are modifiable and smoking diet and physical exercise are key targets for prevention our results on the link between chd and cognition underline the importance of these preventive measures by highlighting the impact of these risk factors not only on chd but also on peoples cognitive functioning
6771038 for example in men the risk of poor performance on reasoning decreased by about 30 for every five years from the time of the first diagnosis of chd
6771039 it is possible that shared risk factors drive this association it is also possible that heart disease influences cognition through cerebral embolism or decreased cerebral perfusion

6771057 afortunadamente estamos en un estado privilegiado porque hay otros lugares por ejemplo en el sur en donde por usos y costumbres los hombres no permiten a las esposas embarazadas ir a revisi n ginecol gica aqu no se llega tanto pero se ven casos donde no se acude a control perinatal por diversas causas se ve muy frecuente en los embarazos en adolescentes en donde la ni a vive un embarazo oculto y en consecuencia no atendido ya que retarda el mayor tiempo posible para dec rselo a los padres as que esta menor recibe atenci n cl nica hasta los seis meses de gestaci n lo que implica muchos riesgos ya que por su tipo estos embarazos son riesgosos
6771058 las mujeres embarazadas deben asumir su propia responsabilidad en el cuidado de su salud y la del hijo que esta por nacer informarse y acudir a los primeros s ntomas de alarma a recibir atenci n clinica pues un descuido puede ser mortal
6771059 el programa esta aterrizando y va encaminado a reducir la mortalidad materno infantil pues con todo y que esta va a la baja en tamaulipas coloc ndonos por debajo de la media nacional es necesario no bajar la guardia unir esfuerzos no solo a nivel institucional sino social ya que es necesario que se asuma la educaci n sexual y del cuidado de la salud como parte de la vida misma
6771060 i think he will bend over backward not to give markets much to go on just ask yourself what has happened since the last federal open market committee meeting
6771061 inflation has picked up but some of the underlying components of inflation have moderated particularly oil what can he say
6771062 hes going to have let people understand what his logic is on the trade offs between inflation and the risks of recession
6771063 he will provide an outlook and describe what weve been through in the last year
6771064 the fed remains quite concerned about growth all options are on the table
6771065 i hope we get more clarity from bernanke about the coordination between
6771066 the feds done yeomans work but there are limits to what the fed can deliver
6771067 this is how much it will cost to print this book
6771068 i myself will be the second member of the party
6771069 i request you to work in at least one film every two years
6771070 i will remain in annayyas party till my last breath and work up to my best capacity for his party
6771071 but having decided to join politics it is inevitable that i will have to quit films
6771072 if you love me each of you should plant one tree
6771073 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
6771074 we are aware of the log on problems but we have no comment at the moment
6771075 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
6771076 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
6771077 uma medida muito importante para a mobilidade das pessoas na cidade e necess rio que existam t xis com condi es para transportar estes cidad os
6771078 a experi ncia que temos que os t xis para pessoas com mobilidade reduzida n o funcionam uma pessoa est nos olivais e pede um t xi especial mas se o carro estiver em alg s n o vai
6771079 os t xis para deficientes s o uma ilus o
6771080 as licen as servir o apenas para engrossar o contingente de viaturas na cidade
6771081 isto n o traz resultado para os clientes mas sim para quem trabalha que fica com mais uma licen a
6771082 n o h t xis adaptados a cidad os com mobilidade reduzida
6771083 s a licen a em si tem um valor econ mico
6771084 because he was deemed not to be a security threat
6771085 if there are legitimate issues about him or any other journalist lets have them aired openly and tested if there are none let them pursue their profession free from intimidation and fear
6771086 the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didnt exist
6771087 baudelaire 1821 1867 i didnt know jesus was a goalkeeper what team did he play for
6771088 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god john 1 1
6771089 the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didnt exist
6771090 ri v n g f u c i j v a g f b v
6771091 weve toyed with all sorts of names but we have probably sought too many opinions between us weve got orion hal and bay so a name like john is probably out of the question
6771092 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
6771093 eh nganung naa pa may cwts na wa man gihapon nay gamit hago2x ra man ta ani
6771094 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games
6771095 thats when the olympic games are over and their task is finished
6771096 they are still cheating us and they dont really want to solve the problem
6771097 almost 30 percent of african americans living in those states who are eligible to vote are not registered
6771098 were fine with caps but we think they ought to be the same for all types of property owners
6771099 we were supportive when the caps were at 2 percent for all types of property owners
6771100 im going to be traveling indiana these next three months urging hoosiers to ask their legislators please let us vote
6771101 people want change and getting a new president is part of that
6771102 i think people have changed their tune a little since the primary
6771103 i dont see any coattails from the presidential for sodrel this time the republican brand is severely damaged in indiana and just being a republican is not going to be an asset this time around
6771104 weve worked hard to provide a whole safety net of services for people in our communities job training food everything
6771105 is just blowing that out of the water its just adding more crisis to peoples lives
6771106 certainly im satisfied with their deciding this is a priority and taking steps to address it
6771107 well continue those programs as part of our core mission and rebalance our spending if we dont get a grant
6771108 its only 3 percent of the total city county budget and if you make these cuts youll do irreparable harm to city parks and that will be your legacy
6771109 i can unequivocally say that political connections had nothing to do with getting the job
6771110 i think it was a combination of the creative side and the budget side of my experience
6771111 all the tax money owed was paid to the irs but it was sent late
6771112 so far the irs has reduced the total due to 11 854
6771113 you wont see me on this side of the bench again
6771114 the death penalty is not a proportional punishment for the rape of a child
6771115 the harm that is caused to the victims and to society at large by the worst child rapists is grave
6771116 it is the judgment of the louisiana lawmakers and those in an increasing number of other states that these harms justify the death penalty
6771117 there is a national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape
6771118 the years of long anguish that must be endured by the victim of child rape
6771119 the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victims life was not taken
6771120 it looks like a smashing victory on all fronts for us
6771121 when are you going to have the courage to stand up for whats right for all of the people but especially the children under 12 that have been brutally raped by monsters
6771122 short of first degree murder we can think of no other non homicide crime more deserving
6771123 execute this man justice has a sword and this sword needs to swing today
6771124 as is now all too well apparent it is mr osborne who is suffering due to mr mostilers grave shortcomings and his racial prejudices of perhaps a lifetime
6771125 na greenpeace estou talvez h 10 anos mas ando no mar pelo menos desde os meus 16

6771128 solution to every problem this country is facing and the only one who can win peoples heart
6771129 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6771130 i think this is our sixth time here and its always one of the best times of the summer
6771131 its an amazing end to the summer its great were very excited
6771132 the main band i want to see will be pendulum i imagine it is going to be amazing
6771133 im not sure whether i would go to see rage against the machine but everybody i know is telling me to go see them
6771134 im here all weekend and ive got my list of who i want to see tonight it is queens of the stone age and then over to see babyshambles
6771135 i saw pete doherty play at a festival in spain earlier in the summer and he was good there so i am looking for more of the same tonight
6771136 steer anger among the population which can be channelled toward the government of this country
6771137 i was waiting for this day and finally i see the russians leaving my home town im so happy
6771138 the distribution of food and hygiene kits went well that is just one day but its a step in the right direction
6771139 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6771140 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6771141 das sieht hier doch aus wie in beirut wir gehen hier weg ich will doch nicht in drei jahren pleite sein
6771142 er hatte sich ein st ck aus der fingerkuppe des linken mittelfingers herausgeschnitten
6771143 we interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants not prosecutors
6771144 he must establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take
6771145 i honestly cant say whether i said it or not i dont use those terms out in public
6771146 the state trial court relied upon georgia procedural rules in denying osborne relief on this claim as such the claim is barred from federal review
6771147 do you think we are going to supply you with a translator all of your life
6771148 if they dont pass theyre going in for the 24 months
6771149 yes i want to see it new york times already wants it
6771150 a dad who has to regularly beat up monsters in the closet before bedtime
6771151 this entire experience has opened my eyes up to a tragic world of injustice i never knew existed if it is possible for law enforcement officials to systematically railroad us with no evidence whatsoever it is frightening to think what they could do to those who do not to have the resources to defend themselves so rather than relying on disparaging stereotypes or creating political and racial conflicts we must all take a step back from this case and learn from it this tragedy has revealed that our society has lost site of the core principle of our legal system the presumption of innocence
6771152 any time we can share resources with local law enforcement its a plus for public safety
6771153 this is having a very negative effect on overall public safety
6771154 people are reluctant to report crimes to the police or be witnesses in criminal proceedings
6771155 theres no evidence these agreements have led to a decrease in illegal immigration
6771156 with the success of the program weve been able to identify people who may otherwise not have been flagged
6771157 its sad if shes got the three children and everything but she should have thought about that before she got behind the wheel of a car
6771158 this has been a ferocious vindictive prosecution of genarlow wilson
6771159 most of those who do not want people to see the tape know that its damning to their position
6771160 these laws are intended to protect the children depicted in such images from the ongoing victimization of having their sexual activity viewed by others
6771161 the bottom line is we need to have respect for the victims in these kinds of cases
6771162 to release this kind of thing to me its prurient and it takes the open records law too far
6771163 mike nifong lost his license and if he lost his license then certainly a district attorney that distributes child pornography ought to be investigated
6771164 sometimes we have to protect our kids from district attorneys
6771165 we ought to do something with that affidavit to make sure its not wasted in case we both leave this good earth
6771166 i was surprised at how unabashed he was in telling us
6771167 you need to tell his attorney he represents an innocent man
6771168 my understanding is that your client andrew wilson is the shooter in the mcdonalds murder
6771169 an innocent man had been charged with his murder and was very likely to get the death penalty
6771170 i have obtained information through privileged sources that a man named alton logan who was charged with the fatal shooting of lloyd wickliffe is in fact not responsible for that shooting
6771171 he wasnt stupid he understood exactly what i was asking he knew he was going to get the death penalty and he agreed
6771172 its pretty creepy watching people deciding if theyre going to kill an innocent man
6771173 i said finally somebody has come forward and told the truth
6771174 ive been saying this for the past 26 years it wasnt me
6771175 what i cant understand is you know the truth you held the truth and you know the consequences of that not coming forward
6771176 if i had ratted him out then i could feel guilty then i could not live with myself
6771177 im anguished and always have been over the sad injustice of alton logans conviction should i do the right thing by alton logan and put my clients neck in the noose or not its clear where my responsibility lies and my responsibility lies with my client
6771178 you cannot live with the situation im in and say what if
6771179 after spending 26 years in this hellhole i want to get as far away from here as i possibly can
6771180 the only time ill be sold is when they tell me i can go
6771181 if you have a warrantless entry you have no legal investigation
6771182 i have two cops chasing me theyre on the dirty side two undercover officers
6771183 you need to cover our rear its all on you man you need to tell them about this sam dude

6771185 how long after a man stops breathing is considered dead
6771186 what color should i paint my new ferarri how about my safety helmet
6771187 i think the main thing the opinion does is it takes the judge out of the quandary
6771188 where the defendant does not give him a definitive answer in words but through his actions
6771189 and this would have been a nice one to start with
6771190 but also when an uncooperative defendant rejects the only counsel to which he is constitutionally entitled understanding his only alternative is self representation with its many attendant dangers
6771191 only dilatory behavior or other misconduct might justify waiver by conduct
6771192 our decision today is meant to provide trial courts with guidance and discretion not to force courts to discharge counsel against their better judgment
6771193 extensively warned garey on the record of the dangers of self representation
6771194 we would be unable to say the government had established jones waiver was knowingly made
6771195 now hes got to prove that he doesnt have knowledge
6771196 im pretty sure that mr garey is going to require that i do
6771197 the courts ruling will give another tool to judges to deal with defendants who try to game and delay the system

6771202 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6771203 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6771204 this is an important step in making health net more competitive and is a key component of our operations strategy to increase our capabilities while reducing administrative costs and improving efficiency
6771205 activists have been engaged in the greening of post boxes across the north in the previous week to assert proudly and very visibly that we live in ireland and our post boxes should be green
6771206 this is a practical manifestation of the all ireland agenda a novel way in which young nationally minded people can promote their irishness and highlight the folly of partition the young people involved in these actions are simply providing a public service and should be applauded for saving an post a job of work when we achieve irish unity
6771207 regardless of the obvious dangers some people will ride bikes in san francisco for the same reason islamic fanatics will engage in suicide bombings because they are politically motivated to do so

6771213 yesterday i noticed from my itunes that apple had recently released 2 0 1 for the iphone i downloaded the 240 megabyte update a little while later i received an unknown error 6 and the update aborted but not until after it had erased my phone so for the second time in the past couple of months my phone became a brick my impression is that apple cant cope with the success of the iphone and the demands it puts on their engineering and support organizations
6771214 yesterday i took my second iphone home after the first one wouldnt hold a charge this one charged and worked fine except for one thing i noticed last night that it had cube runner and facebook apps installed something i know i did not download because i havent downloaded any apps yet i also found somebody elses bookmarks on this iphone at some point in the apple chain someone clearly made a decision to put a returned used iphone back in the box seal it and try to pass it off as brand new

6771273 we have an incredible level of respect for the arthritis foundation and the organizers of the conference who are so committed to helping these families to be able to contribute in our own way with gifts so perfectly suited to the needs of the kids was exciting and empowering
6771274 to be able to offer even the smallest level of comfort and relief to these kids who are forced to deal with pain at such a young age is what running your own business is really about participating on a personal level in this conference makes us that much more committed to making this kind of outreach a significant part of our companys mission

6771313 jugar contra los estados unidos y eliminarlos siempre es importante no s lo por la rivalidad deportiva que existe entre nosotros sino tambi n por la historia pol tica que tenemos
6771314 corea tiene gran calidad ellos sacaron muchos de sus peloteros de la liga profesional de all para venir a los juegos ol mpicos pero cuba ha demostrado que puede jugar en cualquier liga
6771315 siempre es bueno ganar a un equipo como los estados unidos porque eso levanta mucho el nimo nos preparamos bien para este partido pero la verdad es que no esperaba una ofensiva como la que mostraron los muchachos
6771316 me siento muy contento por esta actuaci n porque las cosas no me hab an salido muy bien solo estaba bateando 260 pero parece que ahora vamos bien salimos a jugar duro y ganamos

6771324 s que est n haciendo pruebas que el comisionado y jimmie lee est n trabajando en eso
6771325 dar un vistazo r pido a una pantalla de televisi n puede permitir una decisi n en un par de segundos

6771327 hay muchas otras cosas que el b isbol de ligas mayores puede hacer para acortar los juegos la repetici n instant nea no va a ser un problema
6771328 ser una jugada por semana quiz s no es algo que vaya a demorar muchos juegos

6771357 as long as the fleet is here there will be no problems i suspect people in the ukrainian government do not understand the meaning of the fleet for sevastopol
6771358 the black sea fleet will be in sevastopol after 2017 and sevastopol will not allow any provocation from the ukrainian government this will serve the interests of ukraine and russia
6771359 the overwhelming majority of people in sevastopol would like to have russian citizenship to be nearer russia and to be protected by the russians
6771360 the sphere of the russian language is getting smaller but if we can have russian citizenship there is a chance of living a normal fulfilling life

6771387 gabriel has been hired to a newly created position called director of pro scouting and free agency his primary duties will be evaluating current nba talent and recommending future trades and signings gabriels hallmark with orlando was clearing a massive amount of cap space which allowed the team to acquire tracy mcgrady and grant hill this earned him executive of the year honors for the 1999 00 season after he was fired by orlando in 2004 gabriel went to portland and cleaned out a closet full of massive contracts egos and bad apples to set the table for what is now one of the best run front offices with one of the most promising rosters in the league

6771389 i got involved because i wanted to be part of something new and different
6771390 li nings answer to nikes swoosh is suspiciously swoosh ish albeit more of a check mark
6771391 its a little over five weeks until the opening of nba training camps on september 30th i would expect livingston to sign somewhere before then teams will want to take him through a full camp i would think i still hold out some hope that he could be a clipper but it depends almost entirely on what other teams are willing to offer him if he gets what he thinks is a better offer good for him if not the clippers can make room on the roster by waiving second round pick mike taylor whose contract is not guaranteed until the season starts the clippers are the one and only team who can have shauns bird rights for next season so all else being equal i e if he only gets one year minimum offers and his opportunities are not significantly better one would think hed choose to sign with the clippers in that scenario but if he signs with the lakers and eventually becomes an all star then just put a bullet in my temple
6771392 actually he turns 30 on saturday in the aftermath of the heaviest workload of his career 103 games and 4 055 minutes with the lakers from the start of the regular season to the end of the playoffs without missing a tip and during a summer dramatically shortened by the team usa schedule and now hes got finger surgery pending the age thing is just a numbers milestone figure it will matter not at all he was the best player in the league at 29 years and five or seven or nine months so a few extra pages on the calendar wont change that much if anything a full season with pau gasol and a healthy andrew bynum per the lakers hopes and dreams would mean less heavy lifting for bryant in 2008 09 its an interesting coincidence though kobe crossing the threshold at the very moment hes being taxed more than ever he just had his longest season never before had bryant played all 82 and then logged another quarter season in the playoffs
6771393 ginobili was 7 years old when he started watching those nba tapes with a religious fervor forever hustling outside to mimic the moves just like the kids in the united states would do
6771394 i admire him probably the same way i did with michael jordan
6771395 but the difference was he was representing me with the argentine jersey
6771396 clearly the influx of better players like kobe bryant and jason kidd have combined with the continuity that comes with a three year team commitment to lead team usas dominance at this olympics but perhaps the biggest change behind the scenes that shows just how seriously the americans are taking the competition involves the evolution and sophistication of their scouting department there are basically three decorated n b a scouts on usa basketballs staff tony ronzone the director of international player personnel combines with branch and quinter to form an exponentially more nuanced and detailed oriented scouting staff than past iterations
6771397 in the very first play of last summers tournament of the americas bryant tipped the ball away from the venezuela point guard dived on the court trying to get it got back up stole the next pass and started a fastbreak
6771398 thats the clip coach k coach mike krzyzewski always uses kobe diving on the floor
6771399 youre talking about an mvp player in the nba who just made a statement to usa basketball

6771404 even as googles main expansion continues to shift outside the states with net international advertising revenues expected to rise by 51 2 percent in 2008 the us growth rate is far from a downturn
6771405 the continued power of paid search advertising is key here
6771406 at the same time even as googles main competitors yahoo msn and aol take in smaller shares of the entire us internet ad market their overall importance means that 25 7 percent of all us online ad dollars will flow through those three portals in contrast to 30 7 percent for google alone

6771430 the negative outlooks signal fitchs concern that bulgarias booming economy now running a current account deficit of around 22 per cent of gross domestic product gdp is on an unsustainable path and risks a hard landing despite rigorously disciplined macroeconomic policies
6771431 even if bulgaria achieves a smoother adjustment its gross and net external debt levels are starting to look stretched relative to its rating peers and further deterioration could trigger a downgrade
6771432 the composition of bulgarias growth looks increasingly frothy with construction real estate and financial services contributing 3 4 percentage points of the 6 3 per cent growth in the economys gross value added in 2007
6771433 fitch expects bulgaria will become a net general government creditor to the tune of two per cent of gdp by end 2008 as fiscal surpluses bolster the fiscal reserve account

6771555 as long as the fleet is here there will be no problems i suspect people in the ukrainian government do not understand the meaning of the fleet for sevastopol
6771556 the black sea fleet will be in sevastopol after 2017 and sevastopol will not allow any provocation from the ukrainian government this will serve the interests of ukraine and russia
6771557 the overwhelming majority of people in sevastopol would like to have russian citizenship to be nearer russia and to be protected by the russians

6771589 these findings affirm what were hearing from our business partners who are on the front lines with midmarket companies the fastest growing sector of the economy
6771590 i think that when it comes to losing data because of viruses or hackers or other threats that definitely is a top concern and i would agree with the arrow survey security outweighs cost concern
6771591 these are often fast growing enterprises and while theyre cost conscious they often cant get the leverage a big company can get out of cost cutting measures
6771592 i believe that the 32 percent of respondents that are very satisfied with how their company is addressing security concerns are deluding themselves they should wake up and smell the coffee
6771593 as an industry since 2000 weve spent billions on security in the form of virus protection network security firewalls and other infrastructure do you feel more secure no way
6771594 the gap between our ability to manage complexity and the rate of complexity growth is widening not shrinking making us less secure
6771595 for the mid market guys i talk to technology is not the problem
6771596 its the skills and best practice knowledge as to how to apply the technology to create business systems that is what is lacking at midmarket firms
6771597 democrats know this is a huge prize and they are throwing at least as much money and sweat into that effort as they are into electing mr obama what isnt clear is that voters are as aware of the stakes an unstoppable democratic senate has the potential to alter the balance of power in washington in ways not yet seen
6771598 republicans must defend 23 seats compared to 12 for the democrats of those gop slots 10 are at potential risk virginia new mexico new hampshire minnesota oregon colorado alaska mississippi maine and north carolina the democrats claim only one vulnerable senator this year louisianas mary landrieu depending on how big a day the party has in november it is at least conceivable democrats could get the nine seats they need to hit the magic 60

6771601 we need to do a better job on this discovery
6771602 this story about john mccain losing track of how many houses he owns is a telling moment that helps to explain why he still thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong and why he offers just more of the same economic policies that weve gotten from president bush for the last eight years
6771603 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think that the economy was fundamentally strong
6771604 but if you are like me and have one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6771605 i understand that senator mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and he couldnt answer that question
6771606 the presidential contest came down to this today a question one candidate couldnt answer just as obama would stress a more populist message he heard news today of an inadvertent and totally unexpected assist making his point from john mccain
6771607 the senators answer was pretty surprising he essentially said he didnt know how many homes he and his wife cindy actually own and that was an answer the obama campaign quickly predicted that working class middle class middle class families would have a pretty tough time understanding
6771608 john mccain was asked a simple question in chester virginia this morning barack obama pounced
6771609 maybe youre struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home

6771626 marks going to be back to prepare if he makes it back from this work today
6771627 i think in the next couple of days hell be practicing full speed with us
6771628 ive struggled with that off and on today was just a pretty solid day
6771629 i still need to keep learning but im more relaxed and more confident
6771630 it was just another day for those guys growing it worked out fine
6771631 its refreshing because were getting ready to finally play someone else this is a game weve been waiting to play since january
6771632 hes fighting politicking his way to get out here his attitude and what hes saying tell me he doesnt want to miss anything
6771633 every single version of the bill was neutral on roe each one affected only babies already born not ones in the womb
6771634 essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion
6771635 are you suggesting barack obama wants babies to die ive never thought the republicans would go this far this is about as low as you can go
6771636 he was in the scrimmage the other day and the first time we run the toss he makes three guys miss and goes for about 30 and it looked like him
6771637 i think matt clapp is the type of guy that when he goes on the field we can get demarco in space
6771638 its not that murray is reggie bush this is a different deal but usc would play reggie and lendale white at the same time
6771639 well get him in space and maybe theres some fun stuff to come with it but we havent done a lot of that right now
6771640 we put him full go in the scrimmage on saturday and he was getting tackled and it was full tilt and it was good on good
6771641 he was in there well past the midpoint of the scrimmage and we went over 130 snaps he played hes a competitive kid a tough guy and hes looked good to me i dont know if its 100 percent but he looks fast to me
6771642 were still doing it and picking our spots and were getting in some true game deals and seeing if we can be clean at it
6771643 you guys have seen us we do it some we dont do it some
6771644 one of our rushers got a little too close to him and it set him back for a few days but hes come on here the last couple of days but hes getting better
6771645 he right now will play whether hes standing up as a flex tight end hes a wing guy and hes on our special teams
6771646 hes slated to play and right now i expect him to play

6771693 its nice to feel like people are appreciating your work
6771694 but i dont base how i feel about myself on reviews or what people write my self esteem isnt derived from what hollywood thinks of me

6771697 my mother was a worker and she never saw the benefit of education
6771698 i helped ali moore the abc bureau chief with interpreting and gave her suggestions and ideas and then abc tv hired me
6771699 i got my first breakthrough with newsweek in may 1996 i wrote about a socialist model village dazhai and how it had become commercialised shortly after i became pregnant with my first child i gave up the full time abc job in september 1996 and decided to pursue my own freelance writing looking back thats probably the best decision i ever made
6771700 lots of my friends never knew id come from a worker background they thought i was better educated they said why dont you write a book i started some research and realised although the market had been flooded by china memoirs few are set in the 1980s
6771701 writing has always been my way of making sense of my life
6771702 commemorate that bygone era which i think deserves to be remembered overall there was a lot more control then but in terms of art people dared more they experimented more todays chinese young people are far more self centred far more materialistic i was just a factory worker but we talked very passionately about chinas future people now are so busy making money everything else is just secondary
6771703 i just hope this is a passing phase china has to go through where people want to get richer and get a certain material security and then they will want more spiritual fulfilment

6771937 they disassociate from their own actions often experiencing an hysterical blindness
6771938 the drawn out opening sequence a build up to a murder during which the camera drifts through an opulent mansion filled with valuable artwork including several eerie masks is masterful the signature of the artist who made the exorcist is unmistakable moreover the protracted car chase an hour into the film is nearly the equal of friedkins exceptional car chases in the french connection and to live and die in l a and recalls similarly stomach lurching work by john frankenheimer in ronin the secret seems to lie in not overdoing the action and instead allowing the intensity of the actors to play into the scene while at the same time putting a camera in the car to show the fracas from the drivers perspective
6771939 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
6771940 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
6771941 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
6771942 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure

6771992 concreet willen we bestuderen hoe die moddervulkanen precies werken hoeveel methaan ze loslaten welke invloed dat heeft op de omgeving we willen ook kijken of er specifieke fauna en flora leeft op en rond die methaanbronnen

6772066 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6772067 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6772068 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
6772069 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
6772070 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6772071 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times

6772134 as a group the worlds 15 richest royals have increased their total wealth to 131 billion up from 95 billion last year
6772135 because of technical and idiosyncratic oddities in the exact relationship between individual and state wealth these estimates are perforce a blend of art and science
6772136 while we have tracked the fortunes of a few high profile royals like the queen of england and sultan of brunei for years this is only the second time we have published a definitive list of the richest royals
6772137 monarchs of such countries as spain and japan failed to make the cut

6772257 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways that can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
6772258 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
6772259 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
6772260 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
6772261 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability

6772281 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6772282 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6772283 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6772284 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity

6772299 you can measure the lengths of individual molecules and the average will be a pretty good description of any one
6772300 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
6772301 we generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form
6772302 a list of all types of suspect conformations for known tau mutants then from that list we can design drugs for each
6772303 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6772304 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6772305 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6772306 enable the risks of hrt to be reduced and its benefits maximized when the treatment is individualized to each woman
6772307 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6772308 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks

6772311 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore

6772314 jacob is here with us and is not going anywhere
6772315 there has been tremendous interest in the boy since the cosafa tournament but we are holding onto him
6772316 how can we be releasing our best players when we are aiming at gaining promotion this season he did well during that tournament and that is the kind of form that we hope he will continue with for us in the new season even mohau mokopanela is also staying put with us we are aiming big this season
6772317 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring
6772318 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6772319 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6772320 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6772321 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6772322 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6772323 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6772324 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6772325 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6772326 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6772327 our model suggests that there is a second cell of air in each hemisphere which is characterised by air rising clouds forming storms developing and other processes associated with moisture in the air occurring in the mid latitudes

6772333 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6772334 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6772335 the middle place is about calling home instinctively even when all the paperwork a marriage license a notarized deed two birth certificates and seven years of tax returns clearly indicates youre an adult but all the same there you are clutching the phone and thanking god that youre still somebodys daughter
6772336 theyre actually using the same powers that psychics use except in reverse
6772337 we and others had demonstrated the existence of a dna detection pathway within cells but we are still early in our understanding
6772338 our findings offer an important piece of evidence that this pathway is not only very relevant but it can be the cause of severe autoimmune disease
6772339 the autoimmune epidemic by donna jackson nakazawa is an astounding book
6772340 everyone is talking about the same issue everyone is against the way georgia behaved i also support russia
6772341 we are all the same russia and ukraine and sevastopol are bound so tightly in a knot that it is difficult to untangle it
6772342 as long as the fleet is here there will be no problems i suspect people in the ukrainian government do not understand the meaning of the fleet for sevastopol
6772343 the black sea fleet will be in sevastopol after 2017 and sevastopol will not allow any provocation from the ukrainian government this will serve the interests of ukraine and russia
6772344 the overwhelming majority of people in sevastopol would like to have russian citizenship to be nearer russia and to be protected by the russians
6772345 we have the responsibility to take care of this planet
6772346 we must extend love to all creatures trees and beautiful things

6772348 but we were quickly disillusioned our envoys came up against a wall there was no opening
6772349 head coach foeke booy allows me to do the training often he just observes while i do the work i keep track of progress and discuss the program with him when aandewiel was coach the board asked me to become assistant but i refused i didnt click with aandewiel and that was my main reason to say no but with booy it works out just fine
6772350 i played in the first team of osv oud beijerland when i was 15 years old i was a fast right winger i played on all positions in the team and even played one game as goalie
6772351 thats a funny story my cousin adriaan van tiggelen also played in the first team he was a big boy a center striker slow and not too skilled technically when scouts came to our games theyd ask which player was a van tiggelen and depending on who they asked theyd either point at me or my cousin thats why sparta and other clubs had lots of puzzling and conflicting scouting reports on me some would say i was slow and the next week a report came in saying i was very fast sparta decided to ignore those reports it took years before they realized what the situation was
6772352 meutstege was the preferred left back but he suddenly left the club i played one friendly and everyone was happy so i had my spot i scored in my first competition game and that was it i never lost my spot
6772353 i was really honoured by that and my heart wanted to go but anderlecht also contacted me and their offer was substantially better than ajax arie haan was coach at anderlecht and they were doing better than ajax in those days ive played 5 years for anderlecht and won many prizes there i loved it there although anderlecht wasnt a warm club they celebrated their 100 year existence recently and i expected to get an invite but i didnt hear a thing
6772354 i never actually realized how big that event was for holland until that celebration tour in amsterdam i dont think i played a remarkable tournament i did what i had to do and thats it
6772355 if we become the world champs and the knvb honchos show up at the party i will personally kick them out of the venue
6772356 i respected beenhakker he backed me in that discussion man what a bunch of clowns these officials but the wc was a disaster there was no unity whatsoever beenhakker later claimed that 75 of what happened never came out well ill tell you there was no 75 thats all leos bullshit the 75 that went wrong is probably leo himself
6772357 i played with some top players there scifo munaron degryse grun and later luc nilis our chairman was like the pope you werent supposed to talk to him when i got an offer from france i approached him constant vandenstock with it he listened to me and was very nice but at anderlecht players didnt talk to the chairman the next day the assistant coach told me that i was never ever supposed to do that anymore my transfer to france was not on hahahahaaa
6772358 i was to be the replacement for stan valckx who was very popular in eindhoven but the fans quickly turned around when they saw i could still cut it bobby robson was our coach a lovely guy he would sometimes snooze off during team talks but we didnt care he was a very nice bloke
6772359 i was 35 years old im not the come back kid it was enough
6772360 he is not straight when i was injured he pleaded me to work hard to come back and when i was fit he never used me he will tell you what you want to know but hes never honest
6772361 i knew it was a step back but this was something i hadnt expected the training complex the pitch the coach even they couldnt care less there i played my last game away against volendam not quite a grand farewell on the same day frank rijkaard retired from ajax in a different fashioin
6772362 of course i wasnt the best player but i had my added value i played in the top of europe in oranje i won an ec what more can you ecpect and nowadays my type of player is rare boulahrouz is the only one iin the dutch squad that i can see most defenders want to solve problems in a football way i always wanted to play as simple as possible you dont see that anymore
6772363 not really im happy i dont have the ambition to become head coach i live my life on saturdays i have a beer at the club in oud beijerland and watch my sons play in the first team of strijen with the wife no im good
6772364 im at least a year away from being able to kick with them dibaba was obviously born to run and shes a fierce competitor in her heart and soul
6772365 my legs were tired it was hard to change gears
6772366 dibaba just has a lot of innate ability and she knows her body so well shes a great sprinter beautiful to watch
6772367 my heel is inflamed i gave it the best shot i could
6772368 if it had been any other race i probably would have stepped off the track but this is the olympics so i just pushed the best i could
6772369 this olympics is the jamaican olympics no disrespect to the americans
6772370 this is not the team usa we know were a much better team than this flat out
6772371 the thing that i know how to do is to get away early and hope that they dont catch me
6772372 thats what i tried to do i tried to run the curve as hard as i could because that is my strong part
6772373 she was running when i was in college so shes definitely someone i look up to
6772374 veronica leads by example and when you have people like that in the camp you know youre on the right path the same calm persona that you see on the track thats what we get from her shes a great athlete and a great person
6772375 i told him i was going to do it merritt explains
6772376 he got me through it and im dedicating this race to him the mens 400 is traditionally one of the strongest track and field events for the u s and merritt and wariner did supply a 1 2 finish even though it may not have been in the order many people anticipated and it was nowhere near as close as expected merritt set a personal best of 43 75 the worlds fastest time in 2008 with wariner fading to second in 44 74 and david neville making it a clean sweep for the u s with a 44 80 the 63
6772377 im happy im champion im ecstatic its always been my dream
6772378 being an olympic champion is a dream but another thing is how long you can be at the top
6772379 i would be happy to live as long as possible in this kind of world i am 21 and i would like to live there until i am 36 or 37 years of age like colin jackson and allen johnson in my event that is one of my dreams
6772380 one day very soon im going to go with him and hopefully beat him
6772381 when you can slide it does make the fall a lot better grinned neville
6772382 i couldnt have trained any better i just got tight
6772383 im really disappointed in how flat i was in the last 200 meters
6772384 ive got nothing else going on so i might as well
6772385 it was no more exciting watching bolt run on nbc at night than on youtube in the morning
6772386 our expectations have changed we expect to see sports reality as it happens tv is going to learn to give us what we want or its going to be replaced by something more real and organic citizen journalists are eventually going to start doing their own web newscasts
6772387 i had hoped that it would loosen up a few miles into the race
6772388 it never crossed my mind that i would not finish the race
6772389 this was the most difficult decision to make and an outcome that i will have to live with until the day i can redeem myself
6772390 the marathon is a humbling race and it has humbled me during the most important time of my running career
6772391 not to forget how magnificent the journey has been up to this point
6772392 get myself well and come back ready to tackle the next big thing
6772393 i hated the event i absolutely hated it i never wanted to do it but i was good at it
6772394 even veronica campbell brown who just won her second gold medal in the 200 meter dash couldnt beat me
6772395 okay you can do a good race because this is the weather you like when you run
6772396 if the halfway is easy you can start to push more on the second half you can do more after the first half
6772397 okay its one minute behind me and they cant catch me
6772398 if youre not going to pace yourself this is for nothing youre not going to be able to deal with that weather whoever does is going to be winner shes done the race of her life pacing herself excellently running the second half of the race four minutes faster negative splits
6772399 i want to be in the olympic games and i want to take a medal
6772400 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6772401 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

6772538 after the martyrdom of my mother i said that democracy was the best revenge and today it was proved true
6772539 athen war eine ausnahme und hat viel berdeckt auch sonst haben wir immer nur zwei bis drei medaillen gemacht in seoul sogar nur eine
6772540 ich habe in keiner weise mein pers nliches schicksal mit dem medaillenstand verbunden das w re fahnenflucht
6772541 es tut mir au erordentlich leid wenn jemand der so einen pr wert hat nicht mehr f r sterreich startet darauf hatten wir im oc damals aber keinen einfluss
6772542 das w re aber gegen ber einem sportler nicht richtig gewesen

6772547 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6772548 they are working on a plan that looks lo and behold like the plan that ive been advocating i will encourage the administration to move forward with it
6772549 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6772550 have engaged in skirmishes across the line of control that divides kashmir between the two countries for the first time in years
6772551 we left the house we left everything and came on foot because to stay there was impossible
6772552 they are burning the houses from most of the houses they are taking everything they are stealing everything even such things as toothbrushes and toilets they are taking the toilets imagine
6772553 there was a bomb in the garden and all the apples on the trees fell down
6772554 the wall fell down all the windows were destroyed and now there is nothing left because of the fire
6772555 they came and asked us for wine but first we had to drink it ourselves to show that it was not poisoned then they drank the wine themselves and then they said to leave this place as soon as possible otherwise they would kill us the russians were looking for anyone who had soldiers in their home if anyone had a georgian soldier at home they burned the houses immediately
6772556 he was trying to keep the house and the fields
6772557 afterward he wanted to leave but he was circled by soldiers it was impossible he was in the orchards hiding from the russians in case they lit the house he was walking and met the russian soldiers and he made up his mind that he couldnt stay any more the russian soldiers called him and asked where he was going if he was going to the american side
6772558 my husband said he was going to see his family
6772559 and the russians said again are you going to the american side
6772560 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here
6772561 they support us so much we thought we were alone i am so thankful for the support we have from the united states and from the west
6772562 the west saved the capital they were moving to tbilisi there was one night that was very dangerous the russian tanks were very close to the capital i dont know what happened but they moved the tanks back
6772563 bush and mccain made their strongest speeches yet the russians seemed to back down bush and mccain have been very good for us
6772564 why do you think the russians are doing this in your village
6772565 russia can have at its borders only enemies or vassals
6772566 if we pass this bill which the democrats irresponsibly oppose well solve this problem
6772567 if we bring a new attitude of hopefulness and respect for the world well make the seas higher and the fish more numerous
6772568 our choice wasnt between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war it was between war and a greater threat dont let anyone tell you otherwise and certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who would have us believe that saddams iraq was an oasis of peace
6772569 well brian i think looking back there is something to be said for the idea that i will be a better president now than frankly i would have been four years ago

6772573 a revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having
6772574 i think it would be a brave user who would consider replacing unix servers with mainframes running linux
6772575 it may well make sense to put the new applications on the mainframe otherwise stick to pc servers
6772576 linux is a big driver for mainframe growth 20 of new mainframe capacity is for linux workloads
6772577 we were putting too big a demand on the sun servers which were between six and seven years old and they could not take it anymore

6772584 we are virtualising our wintel estate and will also be considering what we could do around the mainframe side given its efficiency
6772585 currently we have no plans to switch over current apps including point of sale from wintel to mainframe
6772586 by standardising on a virtualised platform rather than having it as a special we will simplify the operation significantly
6772587 mainframes are alive and kicking and remain critical components of a companys it infrastructure especially for mission critical high volume transactional environments like financial services where the mainframe has proven itself to be a trusted platform for housing large amounts of data in a secure and centrally managed environment
6772588 first it enables enterprises to confidently and smoothly scale up the performance of sophisticated data analysis and other bi functions against larger volumes of data second since more customers view bi as a mission critical application why not run it on a resilient and scalable mission critical platform which plays directly to the strengths of the mainframe namely industrial strength processing power high availability reliability security and centralised it manageability finally bi is still a growing market pushing the software onto the mainframe helps companies to both protect and leverage their mainframe investments i e using bi to drive legacy modernisation without replacement of the mainframe
6772589 mainframes have to co exist in a heterogeneous client server web soa software as a service and increasingly cloud computing world
6772590 based on updated guidance and additional analysis of the data we have revised the revenue statistics for the first quarter of 2008
6772591 all 3 000 cobol applications can now access the sql server database without any modification in the code
6772592 once loaded into sql server all i needed to do was change the environment variable to tell the cobol application to use sql server as its data source

6772601 though he lost the semi final round he got the first bronze medal in boxing for the country this will definitely increase the popularity of the game
6772602 oracle and bea have many common middleware customers who have asked us to bring the products together we are trying to do this
6772603 for the majority of products bea and oracle are complimentary where there is no overlap well bring together the bea products into the fusion product family
6772604 we will take tuxedo broaden the number of operating systems it supports and integrate it with our database rac real application cluster technology and oracles soa
6772605 we are certifying all our products on the new version bea weblogic 10 3 and we will integrate it with oracles application server object relational mapping technology web services stack
6772606 im pleased with the way im going the bowling is fine but a few more runs wouldnt go amiss i definitely feel theres a big score around the corner
6772607 ive had success there in the past and its somewhere im confident i can do a job at the batting got better in the test series but having such a long lay off it had suffered a little bit
6772608 now its time to put all that right and start chipping in with some proper runs it hurts me that i have not been scoring the runs id like
6772609 hes taken all the things that make him a fine player into the captaincy his confidence single mindedness and aggression
6772610 for a long time england have under performed in the one day game and hopefully now is the time to address that under kevin
6772611 hes a very confident lad and he wants to instill that into the team
6772612 we havent played one day cricket for a while so were probably going to be a little bit behind the game in terms of executing our game plans so weve got a good challenge ahead
6772613 i had a scan the other day and i will have to have a break at some stage to get it better
6772614 it will be about planning with the medical staff missing some stage of the winter to make sure i am ready for the big challenge at the end of the year
6772615 they are the form side over a period of time now
6772616 they have a lot of talented experienced players weve got a lot of talent but little experience but i think that can work for you sometimes lads are keen to impress and cement spots in our team
6772617 the detention of the yemeni christians not only violates their human rights but also exposes them for further human rights violations like torture and even extrajudicial killings
6772618 boeing co said it is inclined to bail out of its effort to win a 40 billion contract to build aerial refueling tankers for the u s air force unless the pentagon agrees to give it a total of six months to submit a new bid
6772619 why should we be forced from our house while our attackers can walk freely
6772620 the judges should have been restored within 24 hours of musharrafs ouster through a parliamentary resolution musharraf resigned on august 18 and the judges should technically have been reinstated on august 19 but this did not happen
6772621 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without jim morrison
6772622 while the three partners had agreed to the commercial morrison vehemently disagreed and the commercial was not done
6772623 morrison had been adamant against doing commercials and densmore wanted to honor morrisons memory
6772624 we are not going to sign this memorandum of agreement in its present form
6772625 with due respect to the supreme court government in the executive department would like to make this very very clear and there should be no nuancing about this
6772626 the system allows us to deploy manage and utilise our it staff more efficiently rather than wasting their time on legacy tasks like manual tape back up
6772627 this saves at least a day a week in time to build and deploy a fully patched server the time is now being used to focus on our core role of managing and maintaining the system to help users deliver a better service to the public
6772628 landing sharks whole is essential to conservation and effective fisheries management requiring sharks to be landed with their fins attached allows for better data collection and enforcement which is essential to monitoring shark populations and fishery catches
6772629 there is growing consensus that landing sharks with their fins naturally attached is the best way to manage shark fisheries
6772630 congress needs to ensure that sharks in the united states and around the globe are protected by enacting the shark conservation act of 2008
6772631 the fate of the shark conservation act now lies with the u s senate time is running out for this session of congress but we look to the senate to act fast and enact necessary measures to protect sharks
6772632 it reinforces what i thought about him and thats real key
6772633 with idataplex ibm is making web 2 0 style computing more efficient and commercialising it for internet companies and other high performance segments such as financial services and research
6772634 idataplex can provide a foundation that companies can build on to provide improved services to web users around the world
6772635 as far as the county is concerned they seem to have met the letter of the ordinance as its currently crafted
6772636 it was unconstitutional because it was nothing but a veiled attempt at censorship and as a consequence the county was hit with a big legal bill
6772637 im not so much opposed to it being there its how it looks the image its portraying to the community and when we drive by and i drive by with my three children
6772638 what are we going to do about the lives that will be broken by the use of this material
6772639 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6772640 the second most important question at least from my perspective is can this person help me govern
6772641 are they going to be an effective partner in creating economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6772642 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6772643 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6772644 thank you god for giving me the insights to fix this
6772645 the days are numbered verily as are the hairs on your head
6772646 how after seeing all that can you imagine there isnt a god
6772647 ok how did you see all of that as a manifestation of god
6772648 didnt you see the spirit of disunity descend on those men
6772649 our heavenly father we pray for unity among us today and that thy will be done
6772650 i remember a funny story that one comrade told later this was a person whod done a lot of theoretical study and understood a lot of different scientific questions very well so he was able to argue very strongly about why evolution was a fact and take on all this fundamentalist religious nonsense one time everybody had cleared out of the shower room except this comrade and then just as he was getting ready to leave one of the miners came back looked around to make sure nobody was there and then said to this comrade im only gonna say this once i think this religion stuffs a bunch of bullshit too and then he walked out so this gives you a sense of both the atmosphere and some of the ideological work and struggle that our comrades were carrying out within it
6772651 the way mike ely understands the need people feel for religion is practically an ode to the benefits of the salve almost to the point of proclaiming this is really something that is good for the people a real necessity and it is dripping with contempt while also prettifying religion to the point of making it sound like these beliefs at least among the oppressed do more good than bad in the world
6772652 hey jimmy i heard you calling me an agent of satan on the radio last night
6772653 you know we form a bond underground when we hold our lives in each others hands you really get to know somebody
6772654 i have never thought that working people were only characterized by
6772655 unity in this really revolutionary struggle of the oppressed class for the creation of a paradise on earth is more important to us than unity of proletarian opinion on paradise in heaven
6772656 why should we debate amongst ourselves whether the soul is mortal or immortal when we both know that hunger is mortal
6772657 state and local government budgets employee contracts public records policies and other information
6772658 la globalizaci n tiene sus ventajas pero tambi n altares de sacrificio el jk5022 de spanair es ya uno de esos mausoleos cuya lista de muertos hay que dedicar a las desgracias del mundo globalizado
6772659 lo que necesitan es contar con todo nuestro apoyo cercan a afecto y comprensi n es preciso acompa arles durante esas primeras semanas en las que est n tan perdidos no menos importante es esforzarnos por quitarles todo sentimiento de culpa que puedan tener
6772660 tambi n los gobernantes han estado a la altura de las circunstancias y tanto el ayuntamiento y la comunidad madrile os como el gobierno de la naci n tomaron r pidamente las riendas con sus gabinetes de crisis
6772661 hes got it wrong on jerry miller the guy is almost single handedly responsible for getting the city back
6772662 ausbildung ist f r uns bereits seit mehr als 18 jahren ein wichtiges anliegen
6772663 wir folgen damit wieder einmal dem aufruf verst rkt nachwuchs zu f rdern und jungen menschen die chance einer qualifizierten ausbildung zu bieten
6772664 wir bilden ganzheitlich zu fachkompetenten nachwuchskr ften aus die in der lage sind sich auch in die anderen bereiche hineinzudenken
6772665 ich glaube in vielen menschen stecken nicht entdeckte f higkeiten und talente die menschen m ssen sich nur trauen sie freizulegen
6772666 hat er sich da nicht ein bisschen zu viel mit vorgenommen
6772667 ich glaube dass wir alle gemeinsam die welt ver ndern k nnen wenn wir der stimme unseres herzens folgen
6772668 ich glaube dass die besch ftigung mit spiritualit t in der heutigen zeit wichtiger denn je ist denn wir m ssen unsere inneren werte entfesseln und unsere wahren gaben der menschheit zur verf gung stellen so wie paul potts es getan hat und eine revolution des herzens entfachte er sagte in seinem ber hmt gewordenen auftritt ungef hr folgendes mein traum ist dass ich heute tue wof r ich denke das ich geboren bin das darf kein einzelfall sein sondern sollte einzug in das leben eines jeden einzelnen halten ob er gerne haare schneidet kinder aufzieht andere mit seinem gesang verzaubert oder gerne schreibt
6772669 machen sie ihr herz weit auf und schreiben sie sich das von der seele was schon immer geschrieben werden wollte aber nie raus durfte wir suchen die ber hrendsten erhebendsten tiefgr ndigsten momente ihres lebens
6772670 wenn ich verkaufte f hlte ich mich als w rde ich schauspielern nur wenn ich sang hatte ich das gef hl ich selbst zu sein mein wirkliches ich
6772671 und das ist es was alle menschen suchen legen sie es frei und schenken sie damit anderen menschen bezaubernde inspirierende momente schreiben sie es auf und senden sie mir ihre geschichten ich freue mich darauf noch mehr zu erfahren und wir machen vielleicht ein buch daraus
6772672 wie sind sie dazu gekommen einen verlag zu gr nden
6772673 i truly feel like i am charlie in the chocolate factory whenever i visit google
6772674 ngwepe and sam ndlovu are my final signings but im still happy to have a look at mkhonza
6772675 im quite steady at the back but defenders do pick up suspensions and injuries and i dont want to be caught short one extra defender might just be what we need
6772676 mkhonza is an ex bafana bafana player he played for kaizer chiefs for many years and for supersport but i know he didnt play much last season so im going to make a decision next week
6772677 in all the other positions ive reached my limit ive got my squad of 24 so everythings on track
6772678 gary goldstone is also a left back and ngwepe is also a player i can play in an attacking role
6772679 i can play with three at the back were not going to play the same formation in every game and ive got the players to play a 3 5 2 or for a 4 4 2 or 4 5 1
6772680 im looking for both my full backs to be attacking players the modern game is about attacking not defending i need the opposition to worry about my full backs coming forward
6772681 the most difficult thing for any coach is to tell someone whos actually not a bad player look you dont fit into my plans
6772682 we found no tzedek in labor management relations here instead we found plenty of abuse all around
6772683 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
6772684 settled on a global transmission solution because the true impetus for the line is to transport cheaper coal fired generation from western grid areas to eastern grid areas and to encourage the siting of new generation in western grid areas
6772685 we question the modeling that was done to support the alleged need for the frederick to loudoun segment
6772686 i did what i was supposed to do she did what she was supposed to do but i guess it wasnt gods will
6772687 i could not believe that i was out and when i heard last night i was in the final it was my time
6772688 serious research in many disciplines can no longer be undertaken without high performance computing hpc and the university has recognised this through its investment in bluecrystal
6772689 there is a general recognition of the value of mainframe and enterprise servers
6772690 the mainframe can still be at the centre of ibms datacentre strategy but the more fluid parts of its it offering the enterprise servers and the x86 servers can be deployed as commodities where needed
6772691 our strategy is all about managing risk for our clients and we manage risks through these processes its not a silver bullet
6772692 every other supplier seems to imagine that virtualisation is a cure all for everything
6772693 but some applications dont lend themselves to virtualisation at all
6772694 its the cost of the datacentre that is crippling companies not the strategic advantages that technology can deliver
6772695 hp is engineering led and one of the biggest computer manufacturers in the world so it has the capability in our labs to tackle any issue the fact that they look at energy efficiency expressed as dynamic smart cooling intelligent air conditioning and blade designs tells you what the priorities are these days for hp
6772696 once we measured it performance by mips now the benchmark is in watts
6772697 big corporations are predominantly based in london but theres hardly anywhere within the m25 that can cope with the massive drain on the national grid and then they have to find sufficient floorspace at the right price there is certainly nowhere like that in the city so datacentres have to migrate to wherever the capacity is right and there are cooling facilities in the uk that could be scotland
6772698 they should be perceived less as a static structure and more as an agile living organism that evolves as the server and storage infrastructure changes
6772699 its the best way to get higher efficiency better quality of service and increased agility of it operations
6772700 when it comes to ageing datacentres customers have two options
6772701 neither is good for the environment they can rip and replace the entire infrastructure or build new facilities
6772702 cios should standardise equipment consolidate servers storage and applications and automate management then you will see a rapid return on grid computing
6772703 these days companies can be assessed on their corporate social responsibility
6772704 judgements on reputational risk are likely to seriously affect a companys share price
6772705 the us has cheap power and its reduced manufacturing sector means it often has the resources to house a datacentre
6772706 virtualisation will have the biggest impact of any technology on datacentre computing over the next few years as there are so many good things that result
6772707 from consolidation to automation to green computing virtualisation has its finger in all these pies
6772708 the widely accepted figure for the current number of servers virtualised today is 10 but we think it may be more like 24
6772709 this is a trend that will really take off the main server suppliers are all shipping servers with vmware pre installed in flash memory
6772710 the needs of a flexible virtualised computing infrastructure are a little more challenging when it comes to assuring service delivery
6772711 everyone wants to consolidate but theres a massive backlog of kit to get rid of but it runs applications that are not documented written in ancient languages that nobody knows how to transcribe
6772712 they have got a small footprint and they are great for the green economy
6772713 it is still at the heart of many of the worlds top enterprises and it is not certain it will die any time soon but in a growing market it is not growing
6772714 the majority of storage infrastructures were not designed for virtualisation and they do not have the input output capabilities
6772715 the first two generations of datacentre designs are not appropriate for current and future needs new datacentre designs need to be based on flexibility and high levels of monitoring and to incorporate a mixture of power and cooling technologies alongside virtualisation and management tools
6772716 agile living organism that evolves as the server and infrastructure changes
6772717 considering how long they have been discussing this deal it is bizarre they have not published more details of the organisational synergies they expect
6772718 hp is a company with a very different history and culture to eds and unless hp could guarantee that the elements that supported the choice in the first place will not disappear the shift could make some customers very nervous
6772719 we are always concerned about turns in business that could impact our members
6772720 just because a lot of people see your stuff doesnt mean its good but it does mean youre famous
6772721 dear children let us not love with words or tongues but with actions and in truth
6772722 no perpetrator has been identified and we have no suspects
6772723 we havent received any tips from anyone we encourage anyone with any information at all to contact us well continue to work any lead until the cases can no longer be prosecuted
6772724 god damn you dumb goy of course im suing im jewish a meatball without a pot to piss in right now so whatdaya think wolfie

6772730 kpn is a very different company from what it was in 2001
6772731 creating a next generation datacentre does not mean building one from scratch it is more a question of maintaining high standards in the interior of the buildings
6772732 this includes conserving power adjusting air conditioning fire safety doors and security for many customers modernisation also means updating to the latest technology take for example the ibm p series which means that we can service more customers on a single site
6772733 normally cpus in datacentre hardware systems are not fully utilised which incurs unnecessary costs and uses excess power the reason this has to happen is because users have to allow for a certain amount of white space which is only used in busy periods
6772734 following the buncefield explosion our disaster recovery system has become known as a hot swap
6772735 increasingly our customers are also asking us for new datacentre measures to comply with sarbanes oxley requirements including encryption technology for connectivity and additional security around sensitive files this has to be part of the datacentre
6772736 the traditional it model was to build and operate datacentres in house but cios are now increasingly leveraging third parties to meet their needs the traditional it model just is not receptive enough to the needs of the business line of business people cannot wait 18 months for processes to be delivered through the it department cios are looking to develop platforms that enable them to selectively deliver applications on a managed service basis
6772737 one of the reasons that people look to third parties is to reduce the capital constraints of building a datacentre
6772738 that is also one of the main drivers behind the saas movement with which cios are starting to engage
6772739 the traditional application outsourcing model takes applications that were designed to be run on a customers premises and moves the burden of managing those applications to a third party all the traditional outsourcing model achieves is shifting the cost associated with managing an application from internal employees to an external provider
6772740 in the uk focus on the green agenda has rapidly gained momentum
6772741 datacentres are believed to consume 20 of large corporations energy requirements virtualisation shared service models utility computing datacentre optimisation and waste energy re channelling need to be employed to reduce the dependence on multiple equipment energy efficiency must be gained through combinations of all of these developments
6772742 for most large enterprises running power efficient datacentres is not a core competency
6772743 what better way to attack energy efficiency than by outsourcing the problem to an it services suppliers shared datacentre the leading datacentre infrastructure suppliers are all itching to sell their services
6772744 when i heard he won i got so mad i said to myself i cant believe it
6772745 wins its wrong i mean im happy for him but it really isnt fair
6772746 there are elements who have received succour and support from across the border it is a matter of concern
6772747 we are a democracy and all those who claim to speak for the people have the option to come into the electoral mainstream get elected and assume responsibility
6772748 they cannot claim to represent in a democracy without being elected our democracy gives people the option of being elected as members of parliament

6772751 kami mencadangkan debat ini diadakan pada 24 ogos 2008 jam 2 petang di mana mana kawasan di dalam parlimen permatang pauh
6772752 kami berhasrat debat ini dapat ditonton serta didengari oleh penduduk permatang pauh dan seluruh malaysia oleh itu kami mencadangkan debat ini juga dapat disiarkan secara siaran langsung oleh stesen stesen televisyen seperti rtm tv3 ntv7 tv9 dan astro awani

6772756 malah yang jauh lebih utama ialah menumpu kepada bagaimana negara harus mengatasi kemelut sosio ekonomi politik yang terus menjadi cabaran yang semakin rumit dan kompleks
6772757 kami resah melihat semakin berkembangnya budaya di kalangan ahli politik dan organisasi yang mereka wakili untuk mempolemikkan isu picisan serta terlibat di dalam kempen membunuh keperibadian individu tertentu
6772758 kami tidak mempunyai tujuan lain dalam menganjurkan debat ini selain mengharapkan debat ini menjadi medan untuk mengangkat isu isu nasional dan tempatan
6772759 kami percaya kemahiran berhujah serta keupayaan untuk menyampaikan hujah tersebut juga merupakan salah satu ciri kepimpinan yang perlu ada kepada setiap individu yang ingin menjadi wakil kepada rakyat di parlimen nanti

6772791 i went to the hospital to see lcpl fisher the e co
6772792 here is a marine who just lost three of his friends could easily have been 4 of the kias and his way of honoring his friends is to re enlist to stay in the same battalion in order to return to the same place his friends were killed so that he can continue to carry the fight to the enemy and whats most important is that his actions are not an act of vengeance but an act of love a way to honor his comrades he inspires me
6772793 there may be changes in the text but we will not allow any changes that will impede the process or block cooperation
6772794 we need to listen to these countries that have problems india and the us have good answers
6772795 it was all a joke that got disastrously out of hand
6772796 edwards hid his mistress in the caribbean while affair story was breaking
6772797 if team usa finds itself playing for bronze instead of gold on sunday itll be because of the south american nation that has played the americans the toughest when the stakes have been the highest argentina the team that has what team usa wants the team whose fans sing songy chants the u s federation has grown sick and tired of hearing
6772798 while a win for the americans appears to be inevitable it behooves the redeem team to respect their opponents
6772799 there is no secret as to who presents the next great challenge to the united states in its quest for an olympic mens basketball gold medal its a guy they see a couple or four times each nba season a magician who has a great knack for scoring and making plays and infuriating the opposition and if argentina is to shock the basketball world today and upset the u s in the beijing semifinals 10 15 a m toronto time its going to be because manu ginobili goes berserk hes the heart and soul of that team
6772800 its difficult enough to be a negotiator but its almost impossible when youre the type of guy whos so angry at anybody who doesnt do what he wants its the presidents job to negotiate and stay calm i dont see that he has that quality
6772801 his temper would place this country at risk in international affairs and the world perhaps in danger
6772802 by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
6772803 it wont deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda it wont rein in the militias
6772804 the group will focus on education religion and social justice
6772805 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago seemed lost
6772806 in baghdad parks are filled every weekend with families playing and picnicking with their children
6772807 and we have to have a big enough surge that we can get baghdad under control and then anbar province under control
6772808 lo que llevo en mi mente es algo que nadie se imaginar a hasta que forme parte de lo que yo llamo la oscuridad y las tinieblas de lo m stico

6772814 the pakistani government and the military in particular are not monolithic
6772815 in some areas theres very good counter terrorism cooperation with us in other areas there is plenty of room for improvement there are elements within the government and military that might have some links to militant groups in the region that is a matter of concern
6772816 we have not received any specific evidence of any military officer helping terrorists
6772817 if we are provided specific evidence we will take action
6772818 if there was any collaboration of any sort to help the militants you would not see these sorts of things against security officers
6772819 the pakistan army is very professional organization it is one of the best armies in the world
6772820 it is instructional and with the endorsement of haq and brohi it became policy
6772821 in many respects the pakistanis have been very good partners in combating terrorism
6772822 in other areas theres certainly more things that could be done
6772823 what is this guy doing running for president of the united states
6772824 obama is against the war in iraq and wants to take troops out asap
6772825 but at the same time they dont because they became attached to the people over there and the poverty that has risen in those nations i would have to think that if you work in one place for so long then it would be hard to leave the people you fought for
6772826 if youre a soldier you see things differently than a civ
6772827 my brother just got back from iraq and he became very attached to some local nationals that he trained to be one of his kind to help build their military and their democracy he was proud to see their progress growth and morale when he left his deployment
6772828 then again the air force is very caring like that im pretty sure thats why our boys are there
6772829 there is no way obama understands u s troops and what they ensure as much as john mccain a man who served with great distinction in combat
6772830 in addition mccain has two sons who serve making his share of the war time burden greater than 99 of americans obama has never served and doesnt have any military training many of his public statements talking about swat teams in baghdad for example demonstrate that he knows little about the military
6772831 senator obamas apparent insistence that u s forces be rapidly withdrawn at all costs and regardless of circumstances is troubling and potentially self defeating if elected president he seems willing to remove u s forces from iraq even if such a decision contradicts the facts on the ground and the best advice of u s commanders
6772832 i put my uniform on everyday knowing that i make a difference
6772833 will go with the mindset to change multiple lives and to lift their morale about the tyranny that was set forth in their nation
6772834 obama may announce running mate after he finishes his vegetables and puts his toys away
6772835 he tells me that his trial in vietnam was a travesty of justice
6772836 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offenses he was convicted of in vietnam

6772841 the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6772842 obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6772843 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings
6772844 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
6772845 i want to know what makes my little nephew tick
6772846 in the last four years or five years we used movies in our experiments
6772847 but we used movies basically to understand about the brain
6772848 you can think about it as control by the director
6772849 hitchcock managed to take each main area and cause it to respond in a similar way so he basically controlled whats going on in the brain
6772850 you can think of it as real life or the most boring movie ever
6772851 they like to leave things open ended and ambiguous for different kinds of feelings so if director sees a strong correlation maybe he or she thinks they failed
6772852 but then if you think about other movies they dont leave anything open they want to control as much of the brain as possible
6772853 you can go to the area that processes the soundtrack see any correlations and then go to the lighting and then the plot and so forth
6772854 were up on the research aspects of fmri but we decided that its not a viable technology for neuromarketing
6772855 we bring people into the laboratory depending on whichever demographic a company wants examined
6772856 we show them material we wire them up we put electrodes on their head and we precisely measure where their eyes are looking their and their heart rate
6772857 if were analyzing a two hour movie we can extract the most salient parts for a trailer automatically
6772858 the most salient parts fit together into a very nice story
6772859 when people are consuming an experience together theres a form of affects people watching a movie together
6772860 the next thing is were building a small movie theater
6772861 the crowd effect is going to be important for certain things were definitely moving in that direction
6772862 with the market and the companies that approached me the clients simply dont care if its reliable or not
6772863 no one cares because its a sticker on the product
6772864 people we work with keep asking us to look at things at an earlier creative stage
6772865 we are studying a number of options and are open to all possibilities which could include buying lehman
6772866 post he said it best but hes the real deal and i just try to get by without sinking
6772867 although the party does not want to start celebrating too soon the mere fact that such a senior member of the african national congress anc indicated that the debate is at least being started is a step in the right direction
6772868 presidential elections will be held on september 6 the nomination papers can be filed from august 26

6772894 project playlist is free to users and shows advertising to pay the bills it looks like other free streaming sites like last fm for instance that offer similar functionality and ad supported streaming but in this case the labels dont see any cash project playlist insists that it pays royalties to the three big us performing rights organizations bmi ascap and sesac these groups represent songwriters and music publishers but they dont cover the labels that own the copyrights in the actual sound recordings while terrestrial radio in the us only has to pay songwriters in order to play music other services like satellite radio and webcasters pay royalties to both groups

6772896 oss has been dominant in it infrastructure for years gnu linux and various flavours of bsd unix have dominated the internet perl and php have been the predominant development languages of the www and apache actually has expanded its early 80 market share among web servers all of those products are oss
6772897 this document was initially composed in industry standard ascii text file format using the proprietary tool notepad it was then formatted using the open source software package openoffice 2 0 2 and made available digitally in the open standards open document format odf and portable document format pdf
6772898 we see tremendous opportunity sic to deploy oss widely within the ministry to improve stability and application development responsiveness whilst reducing costs
6772899 in summary the adoption of oss can lead to a more stable supportable and cost effective it environment and should be pursued for pragmatic reasons
6772900 given two equivalent packages one open and one proprietary the oss one would be the preferable choice for reasons of better supportability and lower lifecycle cost
6772901 we have not had sight of any evidence to support the argument that the costs of upgrading to vista in educational establishments would be offset by appropriate benefit
6772902 the most important thing americans should know about obama is that he has never been a reformer
6772903 that this image of change and hope that he projects is really a great lie in fact theres never been a single time in senator obamas political career where he did something that was difficult and would cost him politically for the sake of needed reforms and change
6772904 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
6772905 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6772906 maybe you consider yourself a radical maybe a democrat maybe youll vote for obama or maybe you think the whole system is corrupt and maybe you think obama can end the war and maybe he can

6772912 the country has seen a new phenomenon of cheer girls in cricket but the visit of these political stalwarts to the house of a terrorist and extending their support and sympathy to his family is disgusting the bjp spokesman told reporters rudy repeatedly called bashir a terrorist

6772926 when i was there i was shocked to see on their own television references to israels conducting of nazi like experiments on palestinian prisoners prisoners are very important for palestinian society for families and the notion that their family members are being subjected to nazi like experiments just breeds hatred and contempt for jews
6772927 people dont realize that abbas signed a law on the very day there was a suicide terrorist attack in december 2005 against israel providing monthly stipends for the families of suicide bombers
6772928 abbas has never recognized israels legitimacy as a jewish state what was also passed over was a meeting of arab countries in senegal last march during that meeting abbas spoke of the palestinians as being the object of an ethnic cleansing and worse that palestinians are facing a campaign of annihilation by israel and that israel perpetrates barbaric attacks against defenceless palestinians

6772932 it is all about performance she is performing how we want her to at the moment who knows how long that lasts but the same can be said for the young players as well
6772933 as it is julie continues to produce what we want both in her fitness testing and in her core performance as well as her off court preparations
6772934 we do see both as learning from julie who better to learn the ropes from
6772935 she really was the big mover at the defence end during the anz championship she is very tenacious and never backs down
6772936 especially against the australian style she will add real variety at the defence end
6772937 she was rock solid in the shooting circle during the anz championship for southern steel
6772938 she reads the game really well and her availability for the ball is excellent she showed week after week against the australian teams that she is able to put up a volume of shots
6772939 her height and her availability make her a very good weapon for us
6772940 it would have been nice to have a medal but im pretty privileged to already have one there are some insanely capable driven athletes who dont even make the final and as we saw with rower mahe drysdale so many different things that can happen
6772941 this is like a gold for me in a way given what ive had to overcome its just such a relief
6772942 i had some serious doubts and it would have been so easy to give in and not even line up
6772943 but i felt i gave myself the best opportunity my mental focus throughout the race was an accumulation of all my years of training experience and setbacks
6772944 physically i wasnt the best out there but mentally i think ive got something to look back on and feel proud about
6772945 the last four years ive worked really hard to push the boundaries on things and thats had consequences in dips in form and things ive tried to pull it back together and thats been more difficult than i imagined and then the confidence was really low
6772946 to pull out a final like that and get fourth i feel really proud of what i was able to produce
6772947 excuse me for all the cliches and all that sort of crap but its given me a different perspective given the state i was in so many times over the last four years i wanted to quit three times this year i was so close to quitting to get fourth i had to discover a lot
6772948 i was thinking i could sneak a gold mate but i was working really hard on keeping my head in my own boat i wanted to put as much physically into it as i was able to that was relfected with 100m to go when i got the wobbles and had a fair amount of lactate i knew i couldnt give it any more
6772949 hes been through some hard times that boy hes got a big heart and deserves it im really happy for him
6772950 the last four years have been just hammer hammer hammer you get taught the harder you work youll get there but theres a bit more to it than that and ive neglected other areas of my life its taken a toll and i need some time to recover and come back with a more healthy approach to the game

6773060 you dont need to be a genius to produce publishable articles for the travel press you need to know how to go about writing a structuring an article and what editors are looking for those are things that can be taught and we see people on our courses beginners even make amazing leaps with the right input from experienced professionals like our tutors
6773061 writing a travel book is a bigger undertaking and more demanding you do need more of a feel for words and for storytelling but again we find there are plenty of people with ideas and talent who just need to know how to go about things how to channel their natural creativity properly that can take you a long way

6773182 ive been playing an abundance of halo 3 over the past week
6773183 the past week i veraciously went in to halo 3
6773184 the games scope simply did not live up to all of our expectations or to the rest of the game for that matter
6773185 not only that but the game stripped you entirely of his beloved energy sword in co op mode meaning you couldnt use his signature weapon
6773186 the way how the arbiter was handled in halo 3
6773187 this constant error exceedingly hurt the continuity of the games plot
6773188 but even that final mission is eventually sunk by its own undoing
6773189 halo 3 could not excel itself to the level of gaming microsoft had us believe it would
6773190 the past week i veraciously went in to halo 3 like cuba gooding jr goes into a badly written comedy

6773199 the collins hemi 1 well is exhibiting all the characteristics of being a discovery well located on the southern flanks of the cherry creek trend which appears to extend 4 to 10 miles north by northwest of this well additionally it appears this well and our surrounding lease acreage maybe positioned on an anticlinal fault trapping mechanism we have discovered significant amounts of natural gas present in this field and are currently negotiating a market for this gas once we have established a market for this gas shareholders should expect to see a dramatic increase in the oil and gas production over the choked back production numbers we currently are producing upon establishing a market for this natural gas we will aggressively continue drilling and development of collins and other undeveloped lease acreage we have located along this trend in a southeast to a northwestern pattern i would like to acknowledge we have taken more time than usual to complete this well we have experienced weather delays and with the discovery of additional coal bed methane and conventional oil and gas pay horizons present in this well we chose the side of caution and await lab and engineering analysis results before completing this well and putting it into production

6773230 both the attendance figures and the caliber of our attendees speak volumes for the regard in which this industry holds acte education events
6773231 acte has constructed the strongest and longest chain of professional travel management influence in the world the bond of data power and opportunity created at this conference will undoubtedly extend throughout the business travel industry and the asia pacific region
6773232 this is my third year attending the acte asia pacific conference and each year it has grown both in size as well as in the quality of its education the presentations this year have been very interesting and the more diverse representation of speakers from throughout asia has added to the conferences value

6773244 people most in need of a clear and explicit warning regarding ssl certificates are inexperienced users and those are not very likely to understand the error message that firefox 3 is displaying a large portion will simply be scared away thinking that the website is broken
6773245 mozilla firefox 3 limits usable encrypted ssl websites to those who are willing to pay money to one of their approved digital certificate vendors this policy is bad for the web
6773246 used to be the stuff of scary security fiction but now they are point and click
6773247 the only thing that will tell you whether the sites you are visiting are real is the existence of a trusted certificate which only the legitimate site can have
6773248 i dont think the approach in firefox 3 is perfect im not sure any of us do

6773257 ive done it one other time down in tampa in 1998 its unique your players take a lot of pride in the fact that the city and the state and everybody got behind it to get us a new place anytime you have a new home it means something
6773258 we have a lot of guys who played a ton of games in the rca dome so it will be even more special for those guys i think
6773259 i think its very exciting in the sense of what it means going into the 21st century not just for the colts but for our city for our state for the ncaa and for the events that will be there for the whole convention center and the development for downtown
6773260 its great to be part of something you can go back to 1992 1995 1997 and if someone had told you this is what the futures going to look like everyone would be pretty blown away by those things you dont take it for granted
6773261 at the same time when i see something like that you take some time to take it in and
6773262 thats important to me because its about inspiration and people looking at that and taking pride in our state and our city and knowing this is the finest facility in the world its special and historic this is what its about in terms of going into the next century
6773263 driving down the highway you can see it and the dome just looks tiny next to it
6773264 its a state of the art facility and besides football theyre going to have some other exciting events there so it will be cool its exciting for the town
6773265 i think its a big deal for the organization clearly
6773266 the symbolism of having it be the 25th anniversary of the colts in indianapolis theres a real significance to that
6773267 in the long term the building itself and its usefulness to the overarching economic health of indianapolis has sort of been lost in all the excitement about the super bowl and the colts to me former indianapolis mayor bart petersons vision of seeing how that fit in the larger scheme of things and crafting it that way is really a huge huge plus for the city and for the state
6773268 there will be a big wow factor in this building
6773269 its going to be totally different youre going to be able to go in and be entertained for hours before the game thats the idea of it
6773270 that was a goal of ours and something we worked with the architects on
6773271 in terms of local revenue a stadium either makes it or breaks it for you
6773272 it has to work for your fans and your corporate partners
6773273 thats the whole point of a new stadium it has to work for your clients or it doesnt work for you it has to work for a small market team its critical for a small market team to have the kind of partnerships we have with forrest and our founding partners
6773274 well never be one of the top revenue teams in the nfl were just trying to stay competitive
6773275 its so massive its going to be challenging for our fans to step it up and keep it just as loud
6773276 i dont know if im worried about it because i know it will be loud but the dome was kind of a special place in that it just trapped the noise in there lucas oil looks so spacious that i hope the noise doesnt go right off the ceiling
6773277 i think our fans will do a good job with it no doubt it will be a challenge for the other teams offense
6773278 theres no place like home the fans are going to be jacked up were going to be jacked up ready to kick the new season off its an exciting time for the colts and the whole city theyve just got more fans to get in there were going to be bigger and better thats our challenge to the fans
6773279 i imagine its going to be a great experience for our fans and they deserve it theyve been good there will be a lot of excitement with the new stadium and i think our fans will be fired up obviously well have a very competitive team out there on the field
6773280 i think the city has really fallen in love with the indianapolis colts and they come out every sunday and show their support
6773281 the first time we ever went in the stadium was when we played the bears well have a better feel well have two games in there still you go to a new place its a little different and it takes a while to feel like home
6773282 we believe in this team we want them to be here and we care enough about them to build a new place

6773362 de nieuwe werkplek is vooral heel rustig aan de ogen kleuren en lettertypes geven veel meer rust dan ik gewend was het is een heel helder beeld
6773363 omdat de standaard open werplek in elk opzicht nieuw is gaan aanvankelijk slechts twee medewerkers per dag over op deze manier kunnen we medewerkers intensief begeleiden en kunnen we vanuit het project alert inspringen op kinderziektes

6773370 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6773371 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6773372 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals

6773376 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get into trouble he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could
6773377 maybe he was too nice he kept himself to himself he didnt get involved in trouble
6773378 life is too short and all the fights rumors and beefs dont matter anymore what matters is the four of us being friends and getting up on stage again together i cant wait to do this

6773393 the profession of arms is not like other professions nor is france a country like other countries she is a permanent member of the security council she is thus charged alongside the other nations of the world i mean to say the great nations with the responsibility of keeping the peace in the world much is said about the rights conferred by great power status today we are reminded of the price of that status that there are no rights without duties and today our soldiers and their families have paid that price in blood all underlines mine
6773394 the integrity of the overall effort would be compromised if we let students start shopping for the best deal
6773395 our rationale is if you are going to earn home school credit toward your home school degree you should pay home school tuition
6773396 arrangements with outside providers should never have the effect of limiting students other options for study abroad where these other options meet institutional standards for health safety and program quality
6773397 what is objectionable is if the student decides at his or her own risk to go overseas the outright refusal to take credit from a legitimate foreign institution

6773400 most big events the world cup the super bowl the world series and the boston marathon are events that are not only covered by federal trademark registrations but the uses are fairly monitored
6773401 look at the promotional material being put out by the company
6773402 if there is a circled r following a logo or word that means that this is a federally registered trademark
6773403 if it creates the misleading impression that your use of that trademark is approved by or otherwise affiliated with the owner of that trademark then you need to worry
6773404 we are trying to protect the public from believing that the national football league is sponsoring an event at a local bar
6773405 if you provide a factual listing of what you are showing and you provide a footnote distinguishing the event and establishing them as registered trademarks youll have a legal leg to stand on
6773406 the lack of appropriate guidelines and standards for taser usage creates a tough situation for law enforcement officers
6773407 thats what weve been hearing from women who are involved in that life
6773408 theres going to be younger girls who are going to be involved in it

6773420 we should sign our pieces initials would be fine for those in the department no but full name for others with an email address for outsiders
6773421 i think one of the main benefits of encouraging convergence and learning how to tell stories not just through one medium but many media
6773422 creating an environment in which you are not just preparing a journalist to tell a story with one method
6773423 lennon was right and we are bigger than jesus we will be as big as the beatles if not bigger

6773427 this it director sent in a support request saying that there must be a problem with their mail server because they keep getting bounces
6773428 we were able to convince him to send those bounce e mails so that they could be investigated there were about 10
6773429 i did get hold of the nondelivery report and it appeared as though the original mail was sent to a previously entered contact as opposed to having been typed in manually
6773430 i checked their company address list to see if it was in there somewhere and it wasnt
6773431 the only other place it would be would be a personal contact in his own mailbox that he typed there himself
6773432 he continues to insist that we need to fix something thankfully everyone at my company is standing behind me

6773437 the rise of political consultants new ways of winning elections
6773438 while many of them believe in their parties and candidates they also believe in their bank accounts
6773439 giving their time to mccain because they believe he is the best candidate to be president

6773443 argentina could be a major world player in the global soybean market but it continues to punish farmers for growing soybeans to the benefit of u s farmers
6773444 the one thing that could really give a boost to their economy they tax it heavily so there are a lot of problems facing the argentine farmer by way of poor government economic policy

6773462 ive had success there in the past and its somewhere im confident i can do a job at the batting got better in the test series but having such a long lay off it had suffered a little bit
6773463 now its time to put all that right and start chipping in with some proper runs it hurts me that i have not been scoring the runs id like
6773464 hes taken all the things that make him a fine player into the captaincy his confidence single mindedness and aggression
6773465 for a long time england have under performed in the one day game and hopefully now is the time to address that under kevin
6773466 hes a very confident lad and he wants to instill that into the team
6773467 we havent played one day cricket for a while so were probably going to be a little bit behind the game in terms of executing our game plans so weve got a good challenge ahead
6773468 i had a scan the other day and i will have to have a break at some stage to get it better
6773469 it will be about planning with the medical staff missing some stage of the winter to make sure i am ready for the big challenge at the end of the year

6773491 facial transplantation could be successful in the short term but the procedure was not without complications
6773492 however promising results could mean that this procedure might be an option for long term restoration of severe facial disfigurement

6773513 the norwegian government should stop supporting a dying industry and apply the 1986 international moratorium on whaling
6773514 we were able to meet the quota in the two best areas for whaling around the arctic archipelago of svalbard
6773515 only one boat went there this season its a long dangerous trip and its very expensive because of the increased fuel costs so its not worth the risk

6773523 five or six years ago the need for a four day work week wasnt really accepted by management
6773524 i would suspect a majority of employees would probably be in favor of something like this these days
6773525 we have a lot of younger staff members and they drive an average of 30 miles a day it was becoming an issue for them
6773526 what drove me over the edge is we lost one of our really valuable staff members who got a new job because he couldnt afford the extra price of gas
6773527 one reason employers offer these gas saving perks is to keep their best and brightest from seeking positions closer to home
6773528 the same amount of work gets done and everyone gets a three day weekend

6773549 in the league for a while you get pretty cynical
6773550 this is a gamble who says this is going the make the team better
6773551 jameers job as a point guard is to play at a high level and to show leadership at a high level by doing this correctly he creates more value for himself both with orlando and the rest of the league

6773555 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6773556 globalization has depressed the wage growth of low wage workers its been a reason for the increasing wage gap between high wage and low wage workers
6773557 whose side are you on are you on the side of the fortune 500 or are you on the side of the unfortunate 500 000 who will lose their jobs if nafta passes

6773565 people are increasingly worried their banking details might fall into the wrong hands when they purchase online and with good reason optimum allows people to enjoy all benefits of shopping online without having to fear of fraudsters accessing their banking details
6773566 parents looking for a way to educate their children to be responsible with their money find that prepaid cards provide an excellent teaching method because they give the child the chance to be independent and even purchase goods online but there is a strict budget in place this can be handy for everyday life or perhaps if a child is going on a school trip where they need cash
6773567 we have had two good results against ucd already this season
6773568 but they are fighting for premier league survival so it will be tough
6773569 pete mahon will have his team well organised and they have some very good young players
6773570 their confidence will be buoyed by a good win against galway in their last outing but as always we will concentrate on our own performance

6773582 there is genuine shock and remorse the court will have read from the probation officer who cant be easily deceived about his remorse and attrition
6773583 that shock and remorse is greater in a case where there is the loss of a great friend he wants to publicly express his condolences to the family concerned
6773584 you had no business at all to be driving in that way

6773591 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6773592 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6773593 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

6773596 we found out that wall street has been king of a nudist beach
6773597 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6773598 i dont agree with many of the conclusions in the movie

6773603 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6773604 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6773605 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6773606 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6773607 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6773608 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6773609 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6773610 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6773611 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6773612 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6773613 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6773614 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6773615 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6773616 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6773617 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6773618 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6773619 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6773620 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6773621 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6773622 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6773623 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6773631 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6773632 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6773633 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6773634 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6773635 melanie is over the moon at the prospect of becoming a mother for the first time the girls are so pleased for her and have said theyre only a phone call away to pass on any parenting tips

6773646 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6773647 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6773648 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6773649 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6773650 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6773665 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6773666 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and know about gene when he pulled around that left side its like a hurricane is coming through he wiped out everything that was there
6773667 if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6773668 he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6773669 gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled
6773670 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6773671 he fought me for a while saying no i dont want anything to do with it
6773672 but when i got elected to the executive board to the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field

6773675 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6773676 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6773677 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6773678 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6773679 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6773680 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

6773685 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6773686 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6773687 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6773688 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6773689 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6773690 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6773691 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

6773698 hodari joins an ever increasing list of abortionists who are facing criminal charges across the nation this trend demonstrates that while abortionist believe and act as if they are above the law states are beginning to see how dangerous these clinics are and are beginning to crack down on them with the help of pro life whistleblowers
6773699 abortionists tend to be among the most troubled and dangerous people who prey on the vulnerabilities of women prosecuting them is a noble public service

6773704 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6773705 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6773706 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6773707 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6773708 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6773709 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6773710 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6773711 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6773712 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6773713 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6773714 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6773715 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6773716 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6773717 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6773718 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6773719 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6773720 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6773721 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6773722 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6773723 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6773724 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6773725 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6773726 hot or not generic branded and functional virtual goods oh my
6773727 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6773728 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6773729 the development testing qa production environments arent the same the sysadmins are looking at it they should be done
6773730 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions

6773741 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6773742 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6773743 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6773744 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6773745 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy

6773810 man muss immer darauf achten was f r das volk brigbleibt
6773811 die n chsten spiele sind in london schlechte karten also f r madrid gleiches gilt f r tokio bleibt chicago doch die amis hatten die sommerspiele schon vier mal und in rio gibt es keine terrorismusgefahr schlie lich haben wir jo o havelange

6773814 olympia hat die westliche konsumkultur in china gest rkt sie ver ndert wirklich unser leben
6773815 alles was wir brauchen ist vom westen alle labels alle marken insofern waren die olympischen spiele eine chance f r jedermann in china mindestens 51 prozent an ihnen war positiv f r die chinesen
6773816 durch die olympischen spiele in peking ist china entsensibilisiert worden es sieht jetzt auch aus wie ein gro es land
6773817 lass sein mit der politik endlich ist mal was anderes
6773818 ich bin zwar kein patriot aber mir wird bange um unseren nationalstolz wenn ich an die londoner spiele 2012 denke
6773819 wie zum teufel sollen wir eine noch bessere feier auf die beine stellen wir k nnen genauso gut einzeln ins stadion marschieren unsere hosen herunterlassen und der welt unsere arschbacken zeigen
6773820 aber bei diesen turnerinnen konnte ich gar nicht hingucken die armen chinesischen kinder
6773821 falls china sein erscheinen als gro e macht ank ndigen wollte dann haben wir die botschaft verstanden
6773822 jeder der schon paranoid war ber chinas aufkeimenden reichtum und seinen status hat nun weiteren grund alarmiert zu sein denn die chinesen haben die vielleicht unvergesslichsten spiele aller zeiten inszeniert
6773823 das erinnert unweigerlich daran dass unsere beziehung zu china die eines schuldners zu seinem kreditgeber ist

6773830 this is an exciting time for the group and with the huge expansion of the market we feel it is the right time to enter the publishing business
6773831 our unique distribution method means that platforms like the sony playstation 2 has at least another 3 years left in its lifecycle and we are in a position to benefit from this

6773849 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6773850 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6773851 show our respect and support for her without it being divisive langevin said in an interview
6773852 recitei isso para sua tia e ela me disse esse poema bonito n o d mas sabe de uma coisa eu n o entendi nada
6773853 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6773854 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6773855 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6773856 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6773857 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6773858 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6773859 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6773860 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6773861 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6773862 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6773884 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6773885 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6773886 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6773887 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6773890 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6773891 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6773897 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6773898 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6773899 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6773900 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6773915 hopefully the champions league will take me onto the next stage
6773916 to win a competition like that is a great achievement for any player
6773917 we are all in the game to win trophies i am no different
6773918 when i have finished i will look back and see how many trophies i have won and judge myself then
6773919 we have a lot of young players in the team and it can only help us
6773920 hopefully we can take that into the next few years and make us a better team
6773921 i am an unselfish player i have said that many times
6773922 i dont just judge my performance on goals i look at assists and how i have helped the team play that is the way my game is
6773923 these are the first field goals ive ever taken i was a little nervous
6773924 on the last one i was a little pumped from the first kick so i was ready
6773925 in 99 welcome was a magical place in the warriors state title game run
6773926 i wondered does welcome have any magic left for us and if it does please let it appear now because these kids deserve it
6773927 i just thought they were trying to make me nervous and i was already nervous enough
6773928 i was just trying to concentrate on the kick it went straight in
6773929 we just come out and do our part on defense and get the offense back on the field
6773930 i could have been selfish and put mikael in the reserves but we are bigger than that
6773931 he had lost his position to patrice evra so after nine years service there was no point holding the boy against his will
6773932 he is a really nice lad and a great professional so i more or less let him conduct his own affairs
6773933 we knew the price we wanted and informed the teams who came in for him
6773934 he went up to sunderland last friday and was very positive about that then manchester city came onto the scene
6773935 he was halfway through his medical when arsenal came in we have no complaints with the deal at all
6773936 n o desculpa me d sua caderneta pra carimbar o atraso
6773937 with kenwyne jones being injured we did lack some physical presence up front
6773938 were delighted with the two signings we needed more strength up there and they will give us it
6773939 the cisse loan deal is a good for both parties for us to look at him with an option to buy him and for him to come and show what he is all about
6773940 i spoke to a player last night and he has agreed to come in principle
6773941 there are just one or two things to be ironed out and theres one other position id like to strengthen before im finished
6773942 our away form has to get better it cant get much worse
6773943 with our away form last year im pretty sure tottenham are looking forward to us coming to london but hopefully we can improve
6773944 last year is history its a new season and a new challenge we gave away two shocking goals at tottenham last year and we know we cant make the same mistakes again against any team
6773945 the players i have brought in have got experience of playing in the premier league and we lacked that last year
6773946 its not always about getting victories its about being able to get draws as well
6773947 a lot of the time last season we had decent possession and good opportunities but we gave away silly goals tottenham was a prime example
6773948 its always nice to go back to your old club but they are sunderland players now and they will be focused on doing a job for us
6773949 hopefully we can catch tottenham on an off day because talent wise they are very strong
6773950 they have made some outstanding signings and come end of season tottenham will be high up that premier league table they will have a big say in the league and the cup competitions
6773951 every manager in the premier league has a big job especially after you lose the first game
6773952 la gente est tan desesperada que hay un mercado para ellos
6773953 tengo 27 a os y vendo ri n en buen estado cualquier consulta a este correo xxxxxxxxxx el precio tambi n puede ser tratable es urgente
6773954 porque necesitaba dinero dije que qu hago qu hago y una amiga me dijo medio en broma que quer a vender su ri n y entonces sin querer queriendo yo me met en internet para ver que hab a
6773955 ahorita me urge venderlo la verdad no s que hacer yo ten a un precio establecido de us 10 000 para mi ri n pero cada vez creo que est menos y he escuchado que hay gente que lo ha vendido hasta por us 5 000
6773956 esto es sumamente peligroso porque si nosotros abrimos sto al tr fico econ mico puede generar unos efectos perversos entre ellos la delincuencia
6773957 si es posible conseguir rganos a trav s de internet u otra v a entonces estamos abriendo las posibilidades para que los delincuentes puedan matar a cualquier persona y traficar con sus rganos
6773958 ac hay un bajo porcentaje sumamente bajo comparado con los est ndares latinoamericanos
6773959 la donaci n es un acto voluntario solidario gratuito y el efecto que producen estos avisos de personas inescrupulosas que venden sus rganos sin tener en cuenta el m vil que est ocasionando esto es negativo

6773964 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6773965 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6773966 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6773967 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6773968 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6773969 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6773970 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6773971 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6773972 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6773973 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6773974 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6773975 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6773976 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6773977 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6773978 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6773979 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6773980 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6773981 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6773982 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6773983 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6773985 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6773986 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6773998 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6773999 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo

6774006 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6774007 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6774008 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6774009 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6774010 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6774011 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6774012 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6774013 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6774014 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6774015 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6774016 if you trust every web site but not a government
6774017 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6774018 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6774019 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6774020 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6774021 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6774022 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6774023 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6774194 the events of the previous two weeks strongly suggest that we have seen the cyclical bottom in the u s dollar
6774195 the key short term driver for the dollar has really been the oil price
6774196 higher oil prices have significant effect on the u s growth that is the primary reason why oil is bad for the dollar

6774215 a few years ago executives at the prestigious university of chicago medical center were concerned that an increasing number of patients were arriving at their emergency room with what the executives considered to be non urgent complaints the visits were costly to the hospital and many of the patients coming from the surrounding south side neighborhood were poor and uninsured the hospital launched an innovative program to steer the patients to existing neighborhood clinics to deal with their health needs
6774216 in december 2006 the medical center hired a public relations firm ask public strategies to help sell the urban health initiative
6774217 ask started work in january 2007 the next month barack obama launched his campaign
6774218 axelrods firm recommended an aggressive promotional effort modeled on a political campaign appoint a campaign manager conduct focus groups target messages to specific constituencies then recruit religious leaders and other third party validators they in turn would write and submit opinion pieces to chicago publications
6774219 an april 2007 draft report from the medical centers polling firm peter d
6774220 one survey question asked for reaction to a particular criticism that had been leveled this new health initiative is not really about helping the residents of the south side of chicago
6774221 axelrods firm warned hospital executives in its may 2007 presentation that primary care doctors opposed it as a break with the centers commitment to the community
6774222 credible validators are critical public health experts and ministers trump politicians
6774223 asks report emphasized the need to be transparent and acknowledge that the hospital was pursuing the initiative in its own self interest as well as that of patients

6774242 many people have died up to now we heard more than 50 but the death toll may increase
6774243 im not a big name like jeff gordon and dale earnhardt jr im not flashy thats good im happy where we are
6774244 if you look at the speed that jimmie johnson and his guys produce the speed that kyle busch and his guys produce we havent been able to do that weve got to find a way to create some speed
6774245 i came here to help move my career back in the direction i was accustomed to being in
6774246 you watch sports you dont normally watch you root for anyone wearing an american uniform
6774247 coach k established certain parameters for the players to follow to be on the team

6774250 they would have to be charged with some sort of statutory offense
6774251 kidnappers usually settle at between 10 to 20 of the demand except in the old soviet union where the mafia is extremely reluctant to negotiate and uses excessive violence to achieve its aims

6774257 died earlier this week after a bout with pancreatic cancer
6774258 the information about one of the attacks is spotty but the owners did have the dog off the leash and not within their sight
6774259 the second dog was actually attacked by a bear and injured
6774260 we always recommend that if a dog is going to be with you keep it on a leash even if its not attacked the dog could bring an angry bear back to you
6774261 in developed areas like heather meadows the rules are a little more strict because theres such heavy concentrated use
6774262 there are 50 million kayakers in the united states and about 700 to 1 000 fatalities a year
6774263 ninety percent of those happen because people arent wearing a pfd and there are no requirements to wearing one
6774264 the fatalities typically have raised a level of concern in several organizations
6774265 one is the coast guard two is the local county police and sheriffs departments particularly the sheriffs they have the water jurisdiction and wake those are the three primary ones
6774266 then you have congressman rick larsens office theyve shown an interest then youve got several independent kayaker instruction groups here in the puget sound area who are also concerned and interested and wanted to do something
6774267 the topic was what could we do what are some possibilities for taking action to raise awareness around kayaking safety in the pacific northwest given the cold water we have around here
6774268 out of those meetings wake formed a safety committee we havent had one before outside of typical officer roles gene took it on and several members of the group got involved our objective was to address the question from the clubs point of view what could we do to help raise awareness and help educate people more effectively
6774269 it was really up to the individual to go out and learn whatever they could
6774270 the club never had a brochure and didnt really have any educational information about safe kayaking so we wrote the brochure this summer
6774271 its now published and it has a very strong emphasis the dominant theme is safe kayaking plus its sort of educational about currents tides winds and cold water here in puget sound
6774272 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6774273 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6774274 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

6774279 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6774280 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6774281 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6774282 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6774283 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6774284 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6774285 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

6774287 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6774288 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6774289 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6774290 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6774291 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6774292 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6774293 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6774294 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6774295 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6774296 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6774297 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6774298 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6774299 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6774300 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6774301 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6774302 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6774303 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6774304 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6774305 that was as good an excuse as she could come up with when i asked her outright this morning why she didnt tell me
6774306 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6774307 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6774308 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6774309 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6774310 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6774311 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6774312 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6774313 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6774314 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

6774327 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6774328 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6774329 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6774330 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6774331 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6774332 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

6774334 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6774335 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6774336 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6774337 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6774338 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6774339 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6774340 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6774341 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6774342 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6774343 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6774344 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6774345 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6774346 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6774347 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6774348 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6774357 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6774358 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6774359 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6774360 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6774361 hopefully the champions league will take me onto the next stage
6774362 to win a competition like that is a great achievement for any player
6774363 we are all in the game to win trophies i am no different
6774364 when i have finished i will look back and see how many trophies i have won and judge myself then
6774365 we have a lot of young players in the team and it can only help us
6774366 hopefully we can take that into the next few years and make us a better team
6774367 i am an unselfish player i have said that many times
6774368 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6774369 we have to be sure that the money is used in cases that offer strong warranties such as housing because its something that human beings defend to extremes and people with a house do everything possible to meet their commitment

6774377 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6774378 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6774379 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6774380 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6774381 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6774382 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6774383 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6774384 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6774385 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6774386 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6774387 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6774388 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6774389 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6774390 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6774391 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6774392 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6774393 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6774394 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6774395 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6774396 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6774397 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6774398 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6774399 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

6774999 im sick and tired of watching this thing for a year and a half im not protecting anybody anymore
6775000 obviously we know every time mark pitches our defense has to be on the top of its game
6775001 because the balls going to be in play a lot
6775002 the last two outings i thought his stuff was as good as ive seen him in a long time
6775003 velocity fastball location on the fastball break on the breaking pitch it wasnt flat it had depth
6775004 philly we just played but theyll be a lot different in their park its real cozy
6775005 were definitely trying maybe too hard we take fastballs and swing at balls out of the strike zone we used to talk last year general manager pat gillick would say that we led the league in leaving guys on base our answer was that we lead the league in scoring runs when you lead in runs scored youre going to leave the most on base now we dont say that because were not leaving people on were not getting them on
6775006 if we dont win its our fault because were definitely capable of winning our division
6775007 we definitely can control our destiny with 39 games to go the team that gets hot is the team that can claim our division we have to stay with them and play consistent
6775008 for the first 1 500 miles do not go over 115 mph
6775009 its a little known fact that you can win money on you know trivial pursuit or something
6775010 when you dont want any pay there are a lot of things you can do
6775011 i had suped up a car before your parents were born
6775012 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6775013 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6775014 the idea is to grow one of these magic thicknesses at low temperature and then heat up the sample slowly to room temperature
6775015 this work represents a key step forward in producing a device to focus helium atoms

6775026 all of a sudden we became a true team in every sense of the word
6775027 the world cup was just such a great learning experience for all of us and we all had to take stock of what we were doing right and what we were doing wrong
6775028 we had to go as a team and then with the new coach
6775029 we just wanted a new culture physically mentally and with how we played
6775030 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves and the fact of the matter is its not 2004 anymore its 2007 and i think you have to live in the present
6775031 there was no pressure going into the game other than it being an olympic final
6775032 our team had stuck together this entire year its been a hard year for everybody i mean weve come so far in 10 months so i think it was a different team a different coach and a different feel going into this we just went into this with so much confidence
6775033 i knew youve got to capitalize on any chance you get
6775034 and you practice shooting all of your life and it definitely came in handy at that moment but my teammates were the ones that were behind me and they have been around through all of it
6775035 you know i think any other coach might have been
6775036 but she kept it really really calm because your nerves can the best of you she was able to manage our feelings and keep us motivated and keep us together at all points of the game
6775037 det r viktigt med ordningen det m ste finnas en tydlig linje
6775038 brands hatch has been very good for us in the last two years i think that the new a4 will also function there very well it s obviously a help that we start with less weight than the 2008 mercedes after the poor result at the n rburgring we are fully motivated to score as many points for audi as possible and to increase our championship lead
6775039 i think that we ll have a good audi weekend at brands hatch we were very fast there in 2006 and 2007 i ve had a win and third place i like the track and want revenge for what happened at the n rburgring
6775040 brands hatch is a great race track very short very narrow i was second there last year it was a good race the english fans are always very enthusiastic about the dtm which is why i particularly look forward to this race
6775041 brands hatch 2006 was probably where i had my best dtm race ever fastest in all practice sessions pole position and 60 laps in the lead before the suspension broke last year i was absent due to my accident so i am obviously exited to see my speed around the little but very demanding and interesting track and hopefully i can repay all the energy and hard work my mechanics and engineers are putting in my edelweiss a4
6775042 we race at brands hatch with ten kilograms less than mercedes this is a positive aspect we were fast at brands hatch last year we ve used the summer break to prepare meticulously for brands hatch but also to have some holiday and recharge the batteries
6775043 i m really looking forward to be racing again at brands hatch i scored my first points in the dtm there last season i like the circuit and the enthusiastic fans i m confident that we ll be fighting for points again at brands
6775044 it s fantastic to be racing again in great britain my last race here was more than one year ago brands hatch is a special circuit with a great history i want to get a good result for my fans and family
6775045 i personally think that the brands hatch circuit is actually a little too short as a driver you can t really find much time however i still think brands hatch is fun perhaps it ll rain in england we saw in qualifying at the n rburgring that we are pretty strong with the old cars in the rain
6775046 i m really looking forward to brands hatch i substituted for tom kristensen there last year the circuit is a lot of fun
6775047 i m absolutely delighted to be able to race in front of my home crowd it s quite a while since i last competed in a race in england i aim to improve again at brands hatch i hope we have a good chance there with the 2006 car
6775048 the last time i was at brands hatch was in 1996 which is twelve years ago actually quite a long time i hope that it stays dry if this is the case we should be very competitive and could even score points
6775049 the final spurt in the championship begins at brands hatch with timo scheider leading our basis for the final assault is very good we have a good chance of winning at brands where audi has a good track record mattias ekstr m has already won there and we were very competitive last year
6775050 it s the shortest track on the calendar and there s a good chance that we ll all get dizzy with a year old car on such a short circuit anything could be possible with good strategy
6775051 we again have a small weight advantage over the 2007 mercedes as we saw last year the track suits the audi it should be possible to get markus winkelhock past gary paffett again and also improve the rocky s points score
6775052 because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter

6775070 we believe that the findings in seas on cancer are likely to be an anomaly
6775071 we dont believe in light of all the data that theres an association of cancer with vytorin
6775072 when you put all of the information together there is no evidence that statins increase the risk of cancer
6775073 early communication about an ongoing safety review of ezetimibe simvastatin marketed as vytorin simvastatin marketed as zocor and ezetimibe marketed as zetia fda investigates a report from the seas trial
6775074 50 and his attorneys met with suffolk county authorities regarding the fire that destroyed 50s house
6775075 the meeting had been arranged weeks ago 50 is eager to review the findings of the investigation when it is concluded

6775089 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6775090 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6775091 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6775092 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6775093 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6775094 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6775095 i know i have a lot of people to prove wrong because i didnt do as well as i could have up there
6775096 at dundee united i did all right in the first game but i didnt think my fitness levels were right up
6775097 then when i did get back in i was trying too hard to impress rather than concentrating on my own game
6775098 i do despair sometimes about what is written about us and ive been saying it for 18 months but it doesnt seem to make any difference
6775099 if someone had just made a phone call they would have discovered that the boy played
6775100 he came over he played on tuesday in a reserve game arranged with qpr a week before that for james collins to play in
6775101 he played we didnt fancy it and hes gone back

6775109 i have family members who are losing their houses their jobs i think people need to get excited about the future
6775110 sometimes we dont see the products until the public does
6775111 people always say we need new products all the time

6775119 i think kevins got a squad thats good enough to be comfortable in the league but challenging for the top six no i dont think so
6775120 he needs a few more acquisitions and it doesnt look like hes going to get them
6775121 hes a new player people dont know him and catches people off guard who dont know much about him the time to judge him will be in three or four months time and it will be interesting to see how he deals with that attention
6775122 thats the sign of a good player that you can still do it when people know about you at the moment hes an unknown quantity
6775123 normally you can get it done in a day although some countries seem to act quicker than others
6775124 we got the paperwork for joe keenan through from australia in a matter of days for instance the sfa have been asking the italians to get it sorted out on our behalf but unfortunately it has not happened
6775125 we have done everything we can and theres no problem as far as we can see so i dont know why steves clearance hasnt come through
6775126 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6775127 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6775128 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6775129 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6775130 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6775131 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6775132 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6775133 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6775134 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6775135 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6775136 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6775137 if you trust every web site but not a government
6775138 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6775139 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6775140 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6775141 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6775142 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6775143 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6775144 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6775145 thats okay we can try for a baby sister next time
6775146 are you sad its okay to be sad we are a little bit sad
6775147 oh no i am going to have to choose one or the other
6775148 we just had to take stock and see if we can improve our fortunes and what wed need to do
6775149 the involvement of an extremely high profile celebrity in the horrific sport of dog fighting prompted universal public outrage and condemnation
6775150 this case will forever remain a pivotal point in the history of animal welfare in this country and the world
6775151 i thought it was just going to be a couple of girls from the gym
6775152 im taking it one step at a time and enjoying the moment but its not out of the question
6775153 it is time for presidential leadership on these critical issues
6775154 unfortunately with oil still nearly 50 higher than just six months ago we had to review the current structure and revise elements that will afford our ability to remain both customer friendly and cost conscious
6775155 snuggles sin is fatigue fatigue and the inability to distinguish between your shoulder and a pillow

6775157 the wave of patriotism hitting the airlines lately would be heart warming if not for the fact that all that seems to be motivating them is a desire to avoid any more bad pr
6775158 for the first time in ages i wasnt lugging around a heavy carry on and you know what it was wonderful we didnt have to worry if the were the right size and weight we didnt have to lug them throughout the terminal navigating a restroom with a carry on is never fun and we didnt have to line up at the gate extra early to be sure thered be room in the overhead bins what a sense of freedom
6775159 tom horton amrs executive vice president of finance and planning and chief financial officer said american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
6775160 i would love to head or join a special membership or delegation of retired and or semi retired sales and marketing individuals it is a shame that after all the years in the industry heading up several 5 star hotels and resort being a past hsami board member that my talents and experienced cant be used to assist those younger and inexperienced members

6775166 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted

6775175 ive never really eaten poorly as such but one of the main sacrifices ive had to make is cutting out fizzy drinks
6775176 im sure there must be a lot of sugar in them so ive cut them out and its made a massive difference
6775177 im now a lime and soda water man and so far it seems to have worked
6775178 the key has been to work hard and make sure that i stick to my diet i did that over the summer and it has definitely helped
6775179 both chris and myself did all the running with the first team squad in pre season and we probably both needed it
6775180 we are now really fit and thats down to the fact that we joined in all of the pre season work
6775181 we know you have your choice in subways lines thank you for choosing the c
6775182 wow they book this guy that many years in advance
6775183 i am very nervous very happy very excited and i request the people of india that i have tried a different type of comedy i have done an experiment so accept it with open hands and give it respect of good comedy because its really a different type of comedy and its a different type of film every director talks about his film like this but i the audience will say the same after watching the film
6775184 the reason of choosing the title mughal e azam was that the theatre group of the film performs a drama titled mughal e azam and this theatre group accomplishes such a mission watching which the people says maan gaye mughall e azam
6775185 sanjay is a very talented boy hes written partner for us he wrote the dialogues for the film and they were highly appreciated hell definitely make a good film thats why i came to see it i am looking forward to see paresh rawals acting the promos are very good its a very fresh very nice looking film i like the title also maan gaye mughall e azam it attracts the audience
6775186 its a different film risk is also there in the sense that in my career i am not such a big personality whom hits and flops can affect i believe i am very small past of the industry and the most important thing is that when i see myself i shouldnt feel i could have done better
6775187 i never saw what happened to me last year as anything to do with football martin would probably claim it was but i know it wasnt from the feedback i was getting every day from teammates and fans
6775188 thats what kept me on top of things it was hard coming up to the end of the season when there were no internationals it was a tough time
6775189 it made me realise that what is really important is playing football every saturday and that is why i am here
6775190 yes it is an important game because its our first home game so its not just for me but for everyone
6775191 at home is where we really have to build up the points i know we will have a fantastic backing from the fans while as players we have to show the same spirit we did at bolton and have more confidence in defending a high line
6775192 those are stunts honestly it is to get publicity that is all it is it is nonsense stoke city have as good a chance of staying up as anybody at all
6775193 the one thing that you know about stoke is that they will have ferocious determination about themselves they got themselves out of the division last year and i thought tony pulis did brilliantly
6775194 i think it will be physical but there is absolutely nothing wrong with that it is part of the game you know that when you come up you are fighting for your lives
6775195 they will be as strong and as aggressive as any side we are likely to play there is an excitement about it there really is
6775196 eventually you will get moaned at if you go a long period without doing something but the crowd at stoke are so pleased that they are back in the big division
6775197 we knew nothing about it until the bus showed up and thats just not the way we like to do business in sundance
6775198 evet ispanya 2 faul at n ka rsa bile litvanya mola alamayacak

6775200 so we are trying to look into the future of tibetan issue as such or the repercussions it may have vis a vis the policy of india china and the world so we are trying to have a brain storming session with our expert
6775201 after all these happenings the tibetans have to review its policy its strategies ngos tibetan government its strategy as a whole we need to understand its weaknesses and our power
6775202 all this week anton has been training trying to get himself fit
6775203 that is as far as it goes for me at this moment in time he is a west ham player
6775204 we have a substantial capital structure with about 1 7 billion of available credit which can be used to take advantage of any consolidation opportunities in the industry
6775205 goodman is planning to launch a new uk logistics wholesale funds worth about 400 million 641 41 million as well as a japan fund valued at about us400 million 457 92 million and down the track a chinese wholesale fund of a similar amount
6775206 we have no plans to increase our ing fund stake
6775207 we are in a good position for any upturn in conditions
6775208 when he reads the whole thing hell probably have a chuckle
6775209 weve come to an agreement with the lawyers we had to make a really groveling apology and had to cut some parts out
6775210 its in that future that machines from intel will surpass human intelligence
6775211 and progress in next hundred years will be more like the progress of last 20 000 years of human history because of technology
6775212 well need new materials to improve transistor performance and new technologies like tri gate transistors trigate gives you more power lower leakage and better density
6775213 cmos will be the platform of the processor and then well have other things on top of that
6775214 wireless radios dont work together in fact they fight each other
6775215 our advice is that we are in a strong legal position and this report has done nothing to alter our view
6775216 the bottom line is we were in a business that we never should have entered in the first place
6775217 the risks werent understood and the risks werent properly managed occasionally you get elements of a culture which are a little rogue
6775218 the views by the superannuation funds on the impact of the global credit crisis on their property exposure were wide ranging
6775219 while managers saw a global repricing of property risk the most common response was that they are unsure about the impact for their future exposure for both direct property and listed property with this uncertainty being stronger for a reits than for direct property
6775220 this uncertainty reflected a mood of waiting for more information before making further property commitments and property portfolio decisions

6775237 while the june uptick may be the first sign of stabilising transaction volumes that in turn could portend future price stabilisation it may also be a transient or seasonal effect and future data will need to be examined in order to identify any trends
6775238 our cautious stance on the space is driven by several factors deteriorating fundamentals and lack of liquidity in the capital markets
6775239 while we have been affected by the increased frequency of natural perils widening credit spreads and soft cycles in key markets we have acknowledged we need to do better
6775240 enduring and effective competition constraint on large low cost incumbent suppliers

6775272 while sydneys cbd is not immune to market sentiment we are still seeing fairly strong buyer interest in inner city apartments from both property investors and owner occupiers
6775273 the increased investment in this part of the cbd as well as the strong demand for student accommodation has contributed to the consistent interest in the area

6775289 it is clear that more than one third of family businesses are close to changing the baton
6775290 you need to plan for it because each of your kids will not necessarily want to do what you think they want to do
6775291 they may have different plans and aspirations which can shock a founder or a ceo
6775292 with the recent changes in the global and local economic environment in particular increasing fuel prices and rising interest rates it is not surprising that australian family businesses have concerns
6775293 most family businesses are operating around broad unwritten family goals under leadership from the first generation founder
6775294 this is not always the most profitable way of operating and can lead to problems down the track around leadership succession
6775295 we invariably find that once they start the process suddenly the light comes on and its not anywhere near as threatening as they think it is going to be
6775296 people who have a go who start the succession journey ultimately end up with much better outcomes

6775308 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6775309 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day
6775310 the general consensus is that we should have the best overall crop production in 30 years we received rain when it was needed
6775311 however we may see improvement in this index in the months ahead
6775312 over 44 percent of the bankers reported that consumers as a result of higher energy prices were encouraged to shop locally slightly less than 12 percent disagreed with this linkage
6775313 this is the best thing theyve released in 15 years
6775314 typically there is demand for 25 000 30 000 square metres of strata space in the cbd on an annual basis at the moment we can count only 4000 sqm of supply and only one small strata project being undertaken
6775315 freehold buildings in the cbd are selling for between 9000 and 10 000 a sqm strata prices average 6000 a sqm
6775316 this disparity would suggest that strata offices are considerably undervalued
6775317 owner occupiers continue to underpin the strata market and this buyer activity will drive increases in strata prices
6775318 even our worst case result in alinta is not a bad situation
6775319 we think shareholder value could be enhanced best by breaking up the remaining assets
6775320 that should eliminate the management fees and fix what we believe is an untenable structure in the alternative there may be a buyer for the business as a going concern
6775321 given the financial position of the company and the leverage in place the risk remains as to how much equity value could be realised out of asset sales should this path be taken
6775322 the question should be asked could bbp stand on its own two feet without the b amp b facility in place in our view no it couldnt
6775323 therefore the future of bbp remains very closely linked to the future of b amp b should b amp b suffer any more problems in relation to its financial position then there is a strong possibility that bbp would quickly follow suit
6775324 it is too easy to simply reference market conditions alone as the cause of the current circumstances of babcock amp brown we clearly need to leave behind those parts of the businesses and practices that are not appropriate
6775325 im still more interested in how im going to sell something before i buy it than thinking about how fantastic it will be to have this investment for the next 20 years
6775326 the history of babcock amp brown and how we work with private investors is to get them involved have a holding period where we enhance the investment in some shape or form and trade out of it
6775327 so they see in a reasonable time frame the results of their investment as opposed to telling them its gone up in value or even that the markets telling them its gone up in value when they go to sell
6775328 so you build up the confidence level you also invest side by side with them so they know you are looking after their money as well as your own i think its why we can today get the response to the initiatives that we do
6775329 that can be a few phone calls to people describing the merits of a transaction and they say if you tell me thats what the deal is thats all i need to know and they send the money
6775330 these things are properly documented and they go through a process but essentially when they say theyre in theyre in
6775331 we recognise that the level of balance sheet leverage that we currently have is not appropriate and that we have too many sub scale non strategic assets on our balance sheet

6775344 client requirements for civils staff remain strong because order books are still full it is one of the key areas which is managing to successfully buck the downward trends which other sectors are facing due to the credit crunch given that there is such a shortage of qualified engineers in general anyway we can certainly say with confidence that good workers will remain in demand
6775345 while the technology sector has been largely spared in the recent economic downturn our clients many of whom work for large technology firms in silicon valley remain uneasy about their job security for nonnative english speakers in a large organization improving english language skills is one way to enhance competitiveness in the face of job uncertainty

6775370 the fact that google is putting their muscle behind these knols cant be underestimated the online marketing community is bracing itself for what is certain to be a new flood of social networkers headed to this site but its not common knowledge yet much like facebook and myspace these programs take a while to get into consumer vernacular when they do there will be an explosion of marketing but its not enough to just put up a knol promoters have to be smart about it thats why ive researched and crafted these programs offering them exclusively to ame and our authors
6775371 we were the first to use social networking sites to promote our authors and the first to use book trailers and micro blogging in fact we were promoting online before it was the in thing to do were pleased to once again be ahead of the internet marketing game with this new program
6775372 there are tournaments where ill shoot 6 or 7 under and thats as good as i can play and the winner is 21 under and im thinking how did they do that
6775373 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6775374 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did

6775393 the rivalry between the king of the north and the king of the south whether by military economic or other means is nearing its end
6775394 with the disbanding of the soviet union in december 1991 the king of the north suffered a serious setback who will be this king when daniel 11 44 45 is fulfilled will he be identified with one of the countries that were part of the former soviet union or will he change identity completely as he has done a number of times before will the development of nuclear weapons by additional nations result in a new arms race and have a bearing on the identity of that king only time will provide answers to these questions we are wise not to speculate when the king of the north embarks on his final campaign t he fulfillment of prophecy will be clearly discerned by all who have bible based insight

6775409 over the bank holiday weekend more than two thirds of us will stay in and do nothing more than watch tv or spend the time online according to a mintel survey now this can be attributed to the weather the economy or as is often the case the technology will get the blame whenever a story accuses us of being lazy fingers always get pointed at technology and i dont think thats fair now ill admit that on occasion i might have sent an email instead of phoning or back in my student days i might have phoned someone in the next room rather than getting up to go and talk to them although in my defence i was probably engrossed in a particularly exciting episode of neighbours however technology has opened so many doors to us that we are doing so much more than ever before the mobile phone and social networking sites have made us more sociable keeping in contact with people all over the world has never been easier at home the same technology actually encourages us to do more how many times have you been sat at home with nothing planned when a text or facebook message arrives inviting you to the pub the tv and dvd have changed the way we watch films how many times have you gone round to a friends just to watch a film consoles like the wii have brought gaming into a whole new social area and digital recorders make it easy to go out and still watch our favourite tv later so even if you cant afford to go out and the weathers awful send a few texts and emails and invite some people round to make the most of the last long weekend before christmas

6775567 new management has begun to shake things up and the turnaround program is well underway
6775568 the roots of some of kraft s products reach all the way back to 1767 but it wasn t until 1903 that james l kraft started his wholesale cheese business from a horse drawn wagon in chicago today kraft produces many of the best known food brands in the world
6775569 in 1988 philip morris renamed altria purchased kraft and in 2000 it integrated the purchase of nabisco into kraft altria sold a small stake to the public in 2001 but maintained majority control until 2007 when the company was completely spun off as an independent company once again
6775570 under the altria umbrella kraft stagnated with declining revenues and little product innovation as a result the stock price today is within 1 of the price where it was when first sold to the public in mid 2001
6775571 new management has begun to shake things up at kraft in june 2006 veteran food executive irene rosenfeld became ceo returning to kraft from a stint at pepsico running its frito lay division
6775572 rosenfeld established a three year turnaround plan based on strengthening the management team improving and expanding existing brands and international expansion
6775573 the turnaround program is well underway several new executives are in place and the organizational structure has been revamped quality upgrades have improved the consumer acceptance of kraft s products
6775574 at the same time management has cut costs with annual savings expected to reach 1 2 billion by the end of 2009
6775575 the late 2007 acquisition of danone biscuits is expected to greatly expand the company s presence in the developing countries international sales grew more than 18 in 2007 and with the danone purchase overseas operations could represent more than 40 of total revenues this year
6775576 the balance sheet is solid and cash flow is strong 2 3 billion in free cash flow in 2007 this gives kraft plenty of currency to make acquisitions buy back stock or increase the dividend any of which could boost the stock price
6775577 there are a couple of interesting large stockholders who are likely to keep management focused on enhancing shareholder value
6775578 my fundamental models indicate that the oil industry is where the best values in the market are
6775579 the economy and stock market have gone through a legitimate crisis because of the credit woes and it takes time for something like that to work itself out
6775580 but the important thing to remember is that weve been through financial crises before even bad debt financial crises like this one and the market has always stabilized and then pushed higher
6775581 and history has shown that those who can stick with the stock market through down times like these will be rewarded
6775582 david dreman one of the gurus i base my strategies on notes in his recent forbes column if you pack up now chances are youll miss a good part of the next bull market
6775583 meanwhile houston based w amp t offshore gets approval from the contrarian strategy i base on the writings of david dreman dreman targets stocks with strong fundamentals whose prices dont reflect the strength of their numbers usually because of fear or apathy
6775584 w amp t is involved in oil and natural gas acquisition exploitation and exploration mostly in the gulf of mexico area
6775585 the company has working interests in about 200 fields in state and federal waters and interests in leases that cover about 2 billion acres it has taken in more than 1 4 billion in sales over the past 12 months and has a market cap of 2 7 billion
6775586 w amp t is considered a contrarian stock using this model because its p e ratio 9
6775587 one way dreman looks for strong fundamentals is by examining eps growth he likes to see companies whose eps have risen lately and w amp ts eps over the past two quarters 1 05 and most recently 1 77 meet that requirement
6775588 in addition the companys growth rate over the past six months 210 52 has beaten the s amp ps growth rate 4 57 and its projected eps growth for the current year is 241 76
6775589 that means the stock has been growing earnings more quickly than the s amp p and is likely to continue that trend in the near future meeting another of my dreman based requirements
6775590 dreman also likes companies that have the ability to raise their payout ratio w amp ts current payout ratio of 13 21 is below its historical payout ratio 13 8 indicating that the company could raise its dividend a bit in the future a good sign
6775591 when you are starting a new season you cant be at your best in the first game it wasnt going to be easy and the important thing was just to work really hard and make sure we got the three points
6775592 we know we will progress every game and get even better but you could see we had a lot of quality in that game players like robbie keane steven gerrard and of course torres so we know if we work hard and create chances we have the ability to score in every game
6775593 for us three points from the first game is just what we wanted

6775666 i remember a funny story that one comrade told later this was a person whod done a lot of theoretical study and understood a lot of different scientific questions very well so he was able to argue very strongly about why evolution was a fact and take on all this fundamentalist religious nonsense one time everybody had cleared out of the shower room except this comrade and then just as he was getting ready to leave one of the miners came back looked around to make sure nobody was there and then said to this comrade im only gonna say this once i think this religion stuffs a bunch of bullshit too and then he walked out so this gives you a sense of both the atmosphere and some of the ideological work and struggle that our comrades were carrying out within it
6775667 the way mike ely understands the need people feel for religion is practically an ode to the benefits of the salve almost to the point of proclaiming this is really something that is good for the people a real necessity and it is dripping with contempt while also prettifying religion to the point of making it sound like these beliefs at least among the oppressed do more good than bad in the world

6775702 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy
6775703 he brings great experience to the club and will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player that the fans are sure to support i have known eddie for a number of years i rate him as a first class player and person and im honored to welcome him to the galaxy family
6775704 unfortunately the sport of soccer is also a business and in order to bring eddie to the galaxy we were required to make salary budget space available and our only available option was to move carlos
6775705 carlos is proven to be one of the great goalscorers in the history of this league and i have the highest regard for him we wish him the very best in the future
6775706 were looking forward to bringing in another quality striker weve now got barrett and dichio who is on the road to getting healthier and this will also help bring young ibee ibrahim along properly were very excited to get ruiz in here he holds the ball up well and is a clinical finisher
6775707 things i am pleased about is that obviously we are a bit thin tonight because of a loss of some players
6775708 not that that is an excuse or anything because chicago was missing some pretty good players too
6775709 were obviously a bit younger when blanco is off the field
6775710 rather than stress the negative we do miss his playmaking ability and his ability to make a pass out of nowhere which he has done for us so many times this year so we lose that and we have to make up for that in other areas and work that bit harder and create chances for ourselves more than just expecting to get the ball we will be very relieved to have him back but it helps us to play a game without him just so we know that at times weve become so reliant on him because hes so important its a good exercise for us

6775798 despite the recent dip in gas prices significant auto rebates still exist on many larger vehicles the nissan armada beat the toyota land cruiser on the strength of a 5 000 rebate and the nissan quests 3 500 rebate makes it top in the minivan class

6775834 food fuel and water crisis in an increasingly populated world
6775835 action is crucial because much is at stake and time is running out five thousand boys and girls under age 5 die every day around the world from diseases spread by dirty water and inadequate sanitation this morning more than a billion people woke up without clean water to drink
6775836 i believe we are at a tipping point the specter is of a food fuel and water crisis in an increasingly populated world facing climate change it means the private and public sectors have a shared interest in working together to solve the worlds water and sanitation challenges
6775837 in an increasingly urbanized world water conservation involves both demand and supply side management between 40 percent and 70 percent of water distributed by city networks in emerging markets is lost to leakages and theft reduce the losses by 20 percent in jakarta and some 800 000 people can have reliable access to drinking water
6775838 now that companies are seeing water as a business risk they are making comprehensive water strategies an integral part of risk management they are going to governments and asking how can we be part of the solution this is what gives me confidence
6775839 we are excited with the results and look forward to continued success as we move on to our next project
6775840 management expects production from this second well to be comparable to the first well and possibly exceed that of the first well
6775841 we have had two good results against ucd already this season

6775848 this will be an opportunity for the audience to see these people up close
6775849 i want them to have a richer understanding of the people they have seen play over the years and a greater appreciation of what it takes to get out there and keep a career going
6775850 its one thing to go to the clubs but the stories who their influences are how they got started best and worst gigs those are interesting
6775851 these classes are the ones every jazz instructor wants to offer but nobody ever takes
6775852 but the minneapolis environment is one where people want to know about jazz and want to like it its kind of a perfect storm right now for jazz the minnesota orchestra is getting more involved with jazz macphail is now one of the top arts institutions in the city and our jazz program is snowballing
6775853 i suppose you could say that im an improvising teacher i dont show up to class with a lecture i take the materials we have and the people in the class and combine it all together on the spot
6775854 enjoyment i want them to feel that they can enjoy jazz music more than they did before they walked in the door
6775855 thats going to be fun i have a feeling there will be differences of opinion and personal tastes involved every point of jazz history is happening right now from the traditional sounds of the jim cullum jazz band to the bad plus
6775856 weve established valuable relationships with consumers who have regularly used lifeclinic blood pressure monitors to help them manage their blood pressure now with the lc600s wider array of biometric tests we can enhance their testing experience and at the same time educate them about the retailers products and services via cbss outernet digital signage network its a win win win situation for consumers product manufacturers and retail pharmacies
6775857 as to my future if i run for governor and win i will serve out my term for four years as governor
6775858 might well put an end to speculation that the governor would take off mid term for washington and a higher office
6775859 i am committed to serving out my term as governor
6775860 i dont have any designs on being vice president if somebody came to me and said that of course i would be honored to be mentioned honored to be asked and it would be difficult to turn that down but i dont have any designs and its not why im such a great and strong supporter of senator mccain
6775861 we are extremely happy to have vicente and wilfredo onboard the glitnir team to have people of their calibre joining the bank is still another statement of glitnirs strength this will not only build new opportunities for our business in south america but also create opportunities in other regions seeking targets for european us and asian companies in south america
6775862 as a part of aligning glitnirs strategy we feel it is important to have people on the ground in strategic markets our two new business directors are great assets for glitnirs international strategy and we welcome them on board the glitnir team
6775863 with the recruitment of mr c ceres and mr perez we are taking a logical next step in our business development in south america where many of the world richest fishing resources are located and the whole seafood segment has a great potential

6775869 lindsay lohan is not only a fake lesbian but shes a fake b ch she could easily come out rosie odonnell and ellen degeneres certainly came out and they had a lot more to lose than lindsay does lindsay wont come out because she only cares about herself and this is just a phase shes going through when ronson dumps her shell just pick up the pieces and date a man

6775886 the visit by ram naresh yadav of the congress followed by bsps akbar ahmad samajwadi partys abu azmi and the imam of delhis jama masjid syed ahmad bukhari to terrorist mufti abu bashirs family in azamgarh confirm our stand that the united progressive alliance upa and its allies are soft on terror

6775898 the charge of the bjp that the upa and its allies are soft on terror now witnesses a conclusive evidence with the visit of ram naresh yadav congress akbar ahmad dumpy bsp and abu azmi sp to the azamgarh village of mufti abu bashir the simi terrorist responsible for blasts in ahmedabad
6775899 the congress bsp and sp have become cheerleaders of these terrorist organisations groups and individuals who are mercilessly targeting and killing innocents across the nation
6775900 is this overt disgusting display of support to elements of terror an attempt to influence the judicial process
6775901 this sympathy with terrorists does not only mark supporting terrorism but also ascertains their collusiveness
6775902 our future product offerings will provide customers with value added solutions combining functional ingredients and flavors
6775903 this prototype provides 500 orac units the measurement system used to measure potential antioxidant activity which is the approximate antioxidant equivalent of an average serving of fruits and vegetables
6775904 because these high orac fruit extracts can be bitter and have some other characteristics requiring masking we find it very valuable to be able to deliver a good tasting package right from the start rather than have the customer struggle with making it palatable for their consumer especially children
6775905 it has been proven time and again that taste is critical to compliance with functional foods and drinks
6775906 die hard supplement users may still be willing to swallow some less than optimal tasting products for the promise of health benefits but the average mainstream consumer will not
6775907 we feel if we can make functional foods a positive experience for consumers the category will grow even more which will benefit participants and consumers alike
6775908 in overcoming bitter burning astringent chalky salty metallic tastes and a host of other off flavors and off notes

6775919 the choices reflect my opinion and belief that these titles are innovative and have the potential to make an impact on the industry
6775920 based on the information available it seems reasonable to assume that emerging technologies such as coal plant with carbon capture and storage are unlikely to be commercially available before 2020 with demonstration projects potentially operating from 2015 onwards
6775921 we have got to have a target not only in australia but also the global community of making a real commercial breakthrough in terms of deployment of low emissions coal technology in the time span 2015 to 2020
6775922 i think our experience with japan and also other countries such as korea represents a good investment model in australia
6775923 ive been talking to a number of chinese companies about that particular approach about strategic partnerships with australian companies
6775924 theyve got to operate on the basis that they are key investors in australia theyre no different to a woodside or a bhp billiton or a rio tinto or an xstrata
6775925 if they want to make substantial investments in australia then they are entitled to see me and my department
6775926 i think that was well received you dont need a middleman to invest in australia
6775927 we regard these issues as central to a free trade agreement
6775928 ausdrill is in its best ever financial and operational shape and is positioned to continue its strong performance for the foreseeable future
6775929 all of our core divisions made positive contributions to the record profit with strong performances in both australia and africa
6775930 ausdrill is well placed to capitalise on the unprecedented demand for mining industry services globally
6775931 serious doubts as to its compatibility with the single european market
6775932 will pay particular attention to ensure that this takeover does not adversely affect competition in europe
6775933 may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and iron ore fines
6775934 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
6775935 we may have to wait until early 2009 before we get the first rate cut because the inflation situation still looks pretty forbidding
6775936 we have had a turnaround of more than 150 million in net current assets and the net worth of the company has improved from 18 million to 91 million
6775937 its going to take a fair while to earn that back you cant sustain those sorts of losses for long periods

6775948 dakine is well established within the board sports sector and it is a brand that has built its reputation on the quality and reliability of its technical range
6775949 one cant deny this is a company that came under a lot of pressure with regards to their exposure to the us and all that sort of thing and whats happened is theyve showed their robust nature
6775950 nab has a multibillion dollar portfolio of clos that hasnt been written down one dollar
6775951 there are plenty of portfolios of loans out there that havent been marked down and once one person does it the others will have to do it too
6775952 the crisis in terms of how it affects balance sheets is still largely lower quality residential loans but i think what we are seeing with babcock amp brown is telling us it is going beyond that
6775953 but it appears to me that iags still pretty skinny on capital so they really cant afford things to derail too much
6775954 were not declaring victory on that front but we are seeing some encouraging signs there
6775955 not very often that a chief executive gets to release such a good set of numbers
6775956 would only be paid to shareholders if continual payment of a dividend could be reasonably sustained over a longer period in a tax effective manner
6775957 being the husband of a rich woman is not the same as being a rich man
6775958 the reality is that barack obama purchased his million dollar mansion in a shady deal involving a convicted felon tony rezko and it raises questions about his ethics and judgment
6775959 you tell me why were so undervalued i think all of our metrics are heading in the right direction except the share price
6775960 we outperformed all the analysts expectations but the price went from 3 to 2 we said nothing our numbers did nothing but beat expectations but the share price went down
6775961 if the whole market was running ahead and we werent moving id be really worried
6775962 but if you look at us from a fundamentals perspective youd probably say its great value but there are just no buyers in the sector
6775963 i had a chance to have a look at vision and it had a chance to have a look at me and then dr unger decided that he thought i was the right person to take over
6775964 well i think that vision has proven so far that it does work
6775965 i think were facing a crucial point in time weve got the first major batch of contract rollovers and some people have raised concern about that i think all of our doctors are happy working within vision they like how it works they like the medical sovereignty they like the fact that they run their practices how they want to the question is though do they want more money
6775966 to me its about whether they take the foot off the pedal or whether they press harder on the pedal
6775967 if they dont get enough money and theyre still dissatisfied theyll still re sign because its the best place to work but they wont be happy and maybe they wont work as hard
6775968 thats what were looking at it is not so much a new model it is tweaking the existing one to see if we can provide for greater incentive for doctors who want to push a bit harder human nature says that if im generating more then id like a piece of that pie as well please
6775969 my job is to look after all shareholders but without doubt the doctors are the most important part of the business and ive got to balance up through the board what is going to provide the greatest incentive to the doctors to continue to grow the business
6775970 theyre there to bounce ideas off and following every board meeting there is a telephone conference with what we call the partners advisory group which consists of about a dozen doctors who represent a cross section of all doctors
6775971 we talk to them about what weve discussed at the board meeting things such as doctor contracts and are we heading in the right direction are we pushing the right buttons
6775972 we have some fights and spats along the way like anybody
6775973 theres nothing wrong with people having different opinions as long as we deal with them
6775974 we still want to acquire and grow through acquisition in ophthalmology so dont get me wrong were still looking at that we just dont see quantum growth in australia
6775975 so to get quantum growth youve got to look at something else
6775976 surfing memorabilia is affordable to most people who want to get something
6775977 for around 100 200 the average surfer can buy a book or magazine whereas they may be unable to spend a couple of thousand on a surfboard

6775979 this year will be good for cashed up people such as surfing lawyers
6775980 the case for field preemption of state laws in drug cases
6775981 why the fda must preempt tort litigation a critique of chevron deference and a response to richard nagareda
6775982 what riegel portends for fda preemption of state law products liability claims
6775983 are trivial compared to wading through the normal complex fda record in addition this onerous task would have to be done in thousands of separate cases the sheer weight of litigation would open up the possibility of third party depositions of present and past fda employees and extensive discovery of fda doctrines
6775984 sharkeys proposal does not correct the deficient error cost analysis in the kessler vladeck plan nor does it take into account the substantive weaknesses of the current duty to warn law in most states with the high risks of false positives on liability the proposals ex ante effects are also likely to deter new drug innovation by adding private law sanctions to the impressive administrative obstacles that now impede new drug development finally its helter skelter results undermine the uniformity that grounds the public acceptance of the law
6775985 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
6775986 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6775987 now we can say goodbye to our image as the sick man of asia
6775988 in our view there must be a high degree of uncertainty concerning the financing of the stanhill bid particularly in light of the significant future funding obligations and lack of exposure to product for marketing for the tampakan project that any eventual owner of indophil faces together with the fact that tampakan will not generate cash for several years
6775989 they said youre not good enough for him and youre ugly

6776003 i have four titanium plates in my neck ive had 14 surgeries over the years
6776004 we think its prudent given the macro environment interest rates credit crunch the subprime issue and the volatility in equity markets and capital debt markets
6776005 i think until that settles down it would be very difficult to make any predictions though we will most definitely be profitable
6776006 madison wis a double lottery winning couple in dane county doubled their winnings again verlyn and judith adamson of mount horeb each claimed a 350 000 jackpot this week for having the winning numbers in the state supercash drawing last saturday but they didnt mention at the time that they also held two more of the winning tickets they claimed two more 350 000 jackpots thursday all four were purchased at different locations but with the same numbers and for the same drawing

6776023 i would not mind having some risky cdos in bhp billiton paper
6776024 there is a radical difference between cdos and traditional corporate debt
6776025 cdos are an artificial construct it is a made up thing whereas if bhp issues paper you know what it is

6776051 you will not differentiate between black and white tall and short hindu and muslim because all are the image of god and he lives in them
6776052 but once you begin to analyze yourself before the mirror you realize that what you considered as weakness is a blessing in disguise you learn to appreciate gods creation and thank him
6776053 i had been praying before the crucifix or the tabernacle so i first thought it was foolish to pray before the mirror

6776174 its hard to forget your first nouriel roubini experience fifteen months ago i watched an asian development bank audience in kyoto squirm and fidget as the chairman of gave his bleak contrarian opinion that the global financial system was about to hit a wall after listening to you i feel like a need a drink or a hug or something i joked to him afterward roubini gets a lot of such quips and as his direst predictions about a once in a lifetime bust in the u s economy come ever closer to reality i find myself hoping hell be proven wrong hats off to roubini how many times in the past year did we hear people say this credit crisis is containable or the worst is over or subprime loan problems wont spread to other asset classes and the like roubini didnt waver and he took considerable flack for it asia had better hope roubinis economic fears are proven wrong ditto for the gloomy predictions of oppenheimer amp co analyst meredith whitney who recently was toasted on the cover of fortune magazine perhaps the magazine cover curse will kick in and the attention being tossed at roubini profiled last week by the new york times and whitney means the worst really is over of course they might say its just a matter of public perception catching up with the reality a financial system in tatters subprime system one reason to think roubini wont be proven wrong is his argument that the problem isnt the subprime mortgage market its a subprime u s financial system fixing the problems sending financial contagion around the globe will require tough decisions in washington and reforms in wall streets securitization system and thats hardly happening how far wall streets reputation has fallen since the collapse of bear stearns cos was revealed by the aiful corp saga japans biggest consumer lender by assets threatened to sue lehman brothers holdings inc in june after analyst walter altherr called aiful arguably insolvent in a report lehman retracted the report earlier this month yet not before japans investment community had a good chuckle the fourth largest u s securities firm with a share price down 79 percent this year calling another institution shaky talk about the proverbial pot calling the kettle black muddle along even the best case scenario for asia looks gloomy as analysts like mark matthews of merrill lynch amp co in hong kong point out the next few years will see asia pacific markets excluding japan muddle along wasnt it just a year ago that investors were claiming asia had decoupled from the u s economy the reasons asia should hope roubini eats some crow are many for one the region remains too reliant on exports while asia made some progress boosting domestic demand slowing u s growth will chip away at living standards from seoul to jakarta for another emerging markets may slide further if global investors become even more risk adverse mark mobius executive chairman of templeton asset management may indeed be right to call the decline in emerging market stocks overdone still a deep recession in the worlds biggest economy could accelerate those losses asia central banks amassed trillions of dollars of currency reserves in recent years a move that wont seem illogical if roubini is proved correct that cash will be needed to provide insurance to global investors that the region wont see a repeat of its 1997 crisis u s contagion a decade ago asia was exporting financial contagion potent enough to send the dow jones industrial average down hundreds of points here and there these days the u s is returning the favor just as diwa guinigundo deputy governor of the philippine central bank predicted to me a year ago hats off to guinigundo he was absolutely right where do we stand now one year later in the u s the lack of improvement in the money markets is still taking center stage roubini said yesterday and the federal reserve on top of cutting its benchmark interest rate 325 basis points continues to expand its liquidity facilities without significant impact on credit creation thats affecting emerging markets for example roubini said the global credit crisis has exacerbated home grown liquidity squeezes in countries like south korea the question is how asia would weather further weakness in the u s chinas boom has provided some cushion yet officials in beijing are busily working to tame inflation it also would be a mistake to think a u s recession wont slam china so heres to roubini for having a good couple of years of economic prognosticating and heres to hoping hell be less right in the future asias prosperity may depend on it

6776237 die strecke macht spa zu fahren es ist nicht die anspruchsvollste strecke denn von einem stadtkurs erhofft man sich meistens mehr es sind sehr viele geraden und sehr viele spitzkehren aber trotzdem hat man immer zu k mpfen denn der griplevel ist im moment sehr niedrig deswegen ist die fehlerquote ziemlich hoch
6776238 das klingt ein bisschen entt uscht hat man sich in der vorbereitung etwas spektakul reres erwartet

6776357 34 but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together 35 then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying 37 jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind 39 and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 40 on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
6776358 15 then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk 16 and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men 17 tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not 18 but jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites 19 shew me the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny 20 and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription 21 they say unto him caesars then saith he unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesars and unto god the things that are gods 22 when they had heard these words they marvelled and left him and went their way
6776359 33 and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his doctrine
6776360 39 and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
6776361 3 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous
6776362 5 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might
6776363 30 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment
6776364 27 and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself
6776365 5 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might
6776366 12 and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul 13 to keep the commandments of the lord and his statutes which i command thee this day for thy good
6776367 22 if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha
6776368 36 for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise
6776369 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things
6776370 3 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous
6776371 5 but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him
6776372 9 in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him 10 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
6776373 8 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
6776374 5 and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ
6776375 5 but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him
6776376 8 owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law
6776377 9 for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich
6776378 2 by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments
6776379 on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
6776380 9 for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
6776381 25 and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life 26 he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou 27 and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself 28 and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live
6776382 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth 19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen

6776394 19 ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift
6776395 26 thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also
6776396 1 then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples 2 saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat 3 all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers

6776400 4 traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god 5 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away 6 for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts
6776401 10 for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcision 11 whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucres sake
6776402 the whole 27 for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god
6776403 16 woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor 17 ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold 18 and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty 19 ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift 20 whoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon 21 and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein 22 and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon
6776404 let us speak where the bible speaks and be silent where the bible is silent
6776405 11 if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever amen
6776406 23 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone 24 ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel
6776407 19 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
6776408 29 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous 30 and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets 31 wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets
6776409 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth 19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen
6776410 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned

6776423 even though i took them with one of the most popular profs at the university a guy who always won undergraduate teaching awards i hated them i found them so far removed from real life and it seemed like the only thing economics was good for was to argue against my political views for me there were other considerations beyond shifting supply and demand curves like social justice but there was absolutely no discussion in class about those kinds of issues

6776588 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6776589 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6776590 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6776591 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6776592 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk

6776595 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment

6776604 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6776605 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

6776608 uit wat ik thans weet blijkt dat de verantwoordelijken nalatig zijn geweest en de lijsten met de namen van de kinderen onvoldoende hebben nagekeken ik eis dan ook dat in de toekomst iedereen op correcte wijze zijn plicht vervult alhoewel men op voorhand moest inschrijven heeft men s morgens bij het vertrek ook nog kinderen meegenomen wat in de toekomst ook niet meer zal kunnen bij de eerstvolgende uitstap zal ik persoonlijk bij het vertrek aanwezig zijn om na te gaan of alles van a tot z gecontroleerd is
6776609 ik heb een mooie wedstrijd gelopen maar ben niet voluit gestart omdat ik een beetje hinder voelde in de hamstring ik heb daar slechte ervaringen mee nvdr van branteghem gaf op het ek 2006 in g teborg op met een dijblessure dus ik nam liever geen risico maar het doel van de eerste drie was gewoon kevin goed afzetten voor de laatste 400m
6776610 tactisch hebben we goed gelopen en arnaud was schitterend hij is zelfs nog een stukje jonger dan jonathan en kevin die jongen werd hierin gesmeten maar heeft de eerste 370 meter super gelopen op het einde is hij wat gekraakt maar hij liep een schitterende wedstrijd volgens mij kan er zeker nog een stukje af van onze tijd want ik heb bijvoorbeeld al niet voluit gelopen
6776611 ik heb een beetje risico genomen door de australi r in de laatste rechte lijn aan de binnenkant voorbij te lopen maar ik moest ik kon niet anders als ik er rondom loop kom ik zeker tekort het was heel op het nippertje ik was snel vertrokken en probeerde direct de pool voorbij te gaan maar ben dan toch op de eerste rechte lijn blijven zitten het is de goede keuze gebleken dat ik daar wat gewacht heb ik wist dat we het belgisch record konden breken en we kunnen er nog eens onder
6776612 een magnifieke wedstrijd c dric heeft zelfs met zijn trage start uitzonderlijk gelopen en de andere drie jonge jongens hebben zich vandaag als ervaren ratten gedragen arnaud kraakt wat op het einde maar loopt volgens mijn metingen toch 46 05 en niet te geloven wat kevin durft op het einde maar volgens mij was het ook de enige juiste optie jonathan en kevin hebben vandaag eigenlijk nog een pak tijd verloren dus het is niet ondenkbaar dat we onder de 3 minuten gaan in de finale voorts proberen we de vijfde plaats te pakken momenteel is er nog geen verandering bij kristof beyens en als het morgen ook nog zo is blijft de ploeg die vandaag gelopen heeft

6776620 it looks like this dell mp3 player is backed by some pretty smart minds though i think it will fail nothing has really put a dent in apples market share and their have been some attempts that havent gone so well a k a the zune
6776621 when the only embodiment of this grand scheme is a story that was planted in the wall street journal and a story in businessweek anything is possible
6776622 the reality of it is dell has some really cool software in zing the middleware so thats promising but running an online music or media store is not like selling printers or notebooks or pcs at the lowest possible price but maybe im wrong maybe it doesnt matter about the experience and songs are just commodities for the people who pay for them
6776623 certainly apple could use some real competition but it would seem to me to be an extremely steep uphill battle that will be very expensive but then again i dont know
6776624 maybe the pc trolls will finally understand being an apple customer in most cases means being a happy customer
6776625 i think the fact that a lot of pc manufactures sell cheap computers affects these results after all i think many users are disappointed in their 400 laptop running vista of course apple sells at a level that brings more satisfaction another possible reason is all the bloatware and anti virus suites forced on pc users from the get go this in itself slows a perfectly good pc down
6776626 the companies that drop in acsi are all windows based it is very likely that vista contributed to it
6776627 not only is apple the beneficiary of this vista dissatisfaction the synergy between ipods iphones and its computer products has helped has well
6776628 nice gesture but not really worth much they should stop billing altogether and give a bonus three months starting from when they actually get working three free months of a crippled poorly functioning service is hardly worth being excited about

6776630 its very rare unless theres some kind of systemic problem like the computer battery thing from a couple of years ago but even then youre still talking about events that are relatively infrequent its like getting struck by lighting

6776731 we want our customers to get the iphone first then only will we carry them

6776765 itll probably hit you tomorrow and youll have what the doctors call an episode and be admitted for tests youll be fine and put it down to a dream but youll always wonder if theres something just beyond your eyesight if youre really unlucky youll remember it all with perfect clarity and spend the rest of your life trying to convince people there are demons and werewolves living among them and end your days in a cardboard box on the south bank
6776766 all that stuff about loving me and wanting to marry me
6776767 i know thats what makes it so nice well get your insurance back for you so that you can rebuild your sanctuary and do your bit to save the planet
6776768 though to be fair the life of the planet cant be altered by mortal hand
6776769 i seem to have been left out of the introductions im wrack
6776770 im an imp lowest of the low in demonic circles unless youre counting gremlins and who would
6776771 i didnt even know they existed until you mentioned them
6776772 er what did you mean when you said mortal couldnt change the world
6776773 did you ever make up a plastic aeroplane kit when you were a kid
6776774 did you ever get fed up with them and take one down pout petrol over it and set it alight
6776775 it was a hurricane i hadnt painted it very well and my friend michael laughed at it
6776776 itll heat up when he wants it to heat up and no mortal will make it otherwise no demon neither
6776777 any other animal thats been abandoned or needs a home but no dogs or cats they have plenty of rescue centres already
6776778 i know where that is i scrapped a jag there once is this benton chap the one who charged me fifty quid to take it off my hands big bloke moustache wears a black suit and a load of gold rings smokes a fat cigar with an expression like he can smell a fart

6776792 champion speakers do not aspire to get a wow we aspire to get the audience to do something for themselves or to think differently about your subject or themselves when we are done you need to think the same way you cannot worry about what the audience thinks of you that is an amateurish way of thinking think bigger what will they do as a result of you speaking makes sense

6776795 you dont want to give anybody a reason to turn back to al qaeda
6776796 there is a measure of hope in iraq that was not present 18 months ago
6776797 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida
6776798 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore
6776799 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them

6776814 i was raised to believe the was built on rewarding hard work but we have seen the folks of washington turn the american ethic on its head
6776815 thats the essence of the american dream and people feel like its slipping away
6776816 for the past seven years so many people in this country have felt invisible like your president didnt even really see you

6776833 in recent years the sales tax has comprised a declining share of total city tax revenues rising levels of untaxed internet sales is likely one of the reasons for this decline
6776834 there is huge waste and loss of water through food that is produced since roughly 50 percent of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted
6776835 there is a need for a mentality shift it would make a lot of sense for people to waste less
6776836 that corresponds to 40 trillion litres of irrigation water enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6776837 in many areas of the world you simply cannot store food efficiently because it is not handled well
6776838 in urban settings we have lost touch with realities people do not know where food comes from they do not know what it takes to produce food
6776839 now if you throw away half of that kilo that means youve thrown away 7 5 tonnes of water
6776840 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future

6776940 uk economic growth has chugged along quite nicely thanks to rising consumer spending which has largely been on credit
6776941 while most of the debt is perfectly serviceable and secured on dwellings the rising number of insolvencies and repossessions is testament to this process having a negative outcome for an increasing number of individuals
6776942 it will be the next six to 12 months which reveal how seriously the credit crunch has affected individuals

6776957 i never heard from her i still havent to this day
6776958 id like to think forgiveness is possible but when her name comes up in conversation i have a tendency to spit out of the side of my mouth
6776959 i realized that i didnt need her drama in my life
6776960 what we found is that when men recalled their own offenses they were more likely to empathize and then forgive but they had to do that emotional work first
6776961 when the women started thinking about their own offenses they tended to feel defensive and guilty and that made it harder for them to forgive
6776962 my father was physically abusive but the most intense hurt was his refusal to talk to me after i hit him
6776963 i just didnt know how to start the process of forgiving
6776964 it wasnt until i was in my forties when i was able to empathize with my fathers situation that he had learned ineffective parenting from his parents and that he was short tempered because he was physically ill that i was able to forgive him
6776965 this was the 60s and early 70s and there were not resources that we knew of to help us
6776966 forgiving my father and my mother for staying helped me learn to trust my instincts and myself be more present in relationships and build loving honest bonds with others
6776967 forgive for love the missing ingredient for a healthy and lasting relationship
6776968 now i can remember good things about him he was an incredibly effective childrens advocate and community organizer in harlem for example
6776969 the things he passed on to me my sense of justice fairness political sensitivity history and my power as a voting consumer are greater gifts than the scars he left behind
6776970 we have not found anything hazardous in the initial testing and the initial examination that we did
6776971 the letter certainly had some threatening language so they had reason to fear but we did not find the initial report was white power they did not find large quantities
6776972 in any situation like this when its a little out of the norm unusual something that could create a hazard we really want to jump on it right away and make sure were protecting the folks coming into see us but the patients and health care workers that we currently have in the hospital
6776973 it is insensitive for anglogold to want to discourage workers from mourning their beloved colleague
6776974 its not necessarily for everybody but its not a bad investment
6776975 it does provide the consumer with some peace of mind that they wouldnt have otherwise
6776976 it just gives you that feeling of comfort in case something catastrophic does come up and bounce you in the face
6776977 its not something i think about every day wow i have it but like a lot of insurance you do things that you know you need to do
6776978 i think its for everybody at least anybody who owns any kind of property and has any money in the bank
6776979 umbrella policies used to be viewed as something needed only by the wealthy
6776980 but with changing economics and the fact we have become such a litigious society it makes sense for all homeowners to buy some umbrella coverage
6776981 if you dont have much in the way of assets theres not much reason to have it
6776982 an individual with a 200 000 home and 100 000 in investments or less probably doesnt need it
6776983 people who dont have any umbrella liability insurance should have some and people who have some probably need more
6776984 any time the economy goes into a deeper funk as its in today people are opportunistic
6776985 it just sort of made sense because of the cost
6776986 my life was sad before because i had to crawl on the ground
6776987 when someone loses a limb they immediately know what theyve lost
6776988 the goal is to restore the healthy self image again so that that person can see themselves whole
6776989 when i finally got into the field of orthotics and prosthetics i said ah ha

6777150 ik heb een mooie wedstrijd gelopen maar ben niet voluit gestart omdat ik een beetje hinder voelde in de hamstring ik heb daar slechte ervaringen mee nvdr van branteghem gaf op het ek 2006 in g teborg op met een dijblessure dus ik nam liever geen risico maar het doel van de eerste drie was gewoon kevin goed afzetten voor de laatste 400m
6777151 tactisch hebben we goed gelopen en arnaud was schitterend hij is zelfs nog een stukje jonger dan jonathan en kevin die jongen werd hierin gesmeten maar heeft de eerste 370 meter super gelopen op het einde is hij wat gekraakt maar hij liep een schitterende wedstrijd volgens mij kan er zeker nog een stukje af van onze tijd want ik heb bijvoorbeeld al niet voluit gelopen
6777152 ik heb een beetje risico genomen door de australi r in de laatste rechte lijn aan de binnenkant voorbij te lopen maar ik moest ik kon niet anders als ik er rondom loop kom ik zeker tekort het was heel op het nippertje ik was snel vertrokken en probeerde direct de pool voorbij te gaan maar ben dan toch op de eerste rechte lijn blijven zitten het is de goede keuze gebleken dat ik daar wat gewacht heb ik wist dat we het belgisch record konden breken en we kunnen er nog eens onder
6777153 een magnifieke wedstrijd c dric heeft zelfs met zijn trage start uitzonderlijk gelopen en de andere drie jonge jongens hebben zich vandaag als ervaren ratten gedragen arnaud kraakt wat op het einde maar loopt volgens mijn metingen toch 46 05 en niet te geloven wat kevin durft op het einde maar volgens mij was het ook de enige juiste optie jonathan en kevin hebben vandaag eigenlijk nog een pak tijd verloren dus het is niet ondenkbaar dat we onder de 3 minuten gaan in de finale voorts proberen we de vijfde plaats te pakken momenteel is er nog geen verandering bij kristof beyens en als het morgen ook nog zo is blijft de ploeg die vandaag gelopen heeft

6777618 in 2006 congress extended the uniform code of military justice to cover pentagon contractors
6777619 unfortunately at the exact moment that contractor related accountability issues are being taken more seriously the bush administration is negotiating an agreement with the iraqi government that would weaken protections for pscs and risk undermining the professionalization of the private contractors protecting us diplomats
6777620 the u s stands out for being the only country that reports significant fractions of the population not getting needed care

6777631 biodiesel logos will be placed on both tractor fuel tanks to show visitors and travelers that biodiesel is a viable clean affordable source of u s made energy that is good for the environment and good for rural america
6777632 this partnership will also provide a good way to spread facts about soy biodiesel in urban areas
6777633 because illinois is a top producing soybean state and the top state for consumption of biodiesel this promotion is a natural fit for the illinois soybean association
6777634 illinois soybean growers have a special respect for abraham lincoln and we are proud to have biodiesel displayed on the unit which displays such an important part of u s and illinois history
6777635 we are very proud to fuel the abraham lincoln self made in america bicentennial tour with this made in america fuel
6777636 this ailing patient the u s cotton sector shows every sign of a great recovery it just may need at least another year to recuperate
6777637 while the long term outlook for the cotton sector in the united states is favorable the sector may still endure some pain before things improve
6777638 acres in the delta region are likely to see a larger decrease approximately 30 percent a change which would see that region losing over half its cotton area in just two years
6777639 despite the relatively low acreage in the long term the u s cotton sector is likely to strengthen largely due to changes in the global sector the u s cotton sector is likely to improve as major global cotton producers such as china and india increasingly divert more acreage into food production to keep pace with rising incomes and populations
6777640 while cotton production in africa continues to have great potential growth is slow and volatility is ever present
6777641 additionally with low yields compared to world averages the region may benefit from increased international focus in terms of multilateral agronomic development and an increased focus from the private sector outside the region that is seeking to develop new resources
6777642 the main reason for the success of indias cotton program has been the implementation of a government program that targeted improvements in seeds extension services marketing infrastructure and processing facilities
6777643 assuming that current trends in terms of strong demand and upward price pressure for grains and oilseeds continues into 2009 it would be reasonable to predict that 2009 10 u s cotton acreage is unlikely to see a major increase if any increase at all
6777644 however as the economic slowdown eases textile demand is likely to strengthen again and with it demand for cotton
6777645 so as global cotton prices react to any future cut in supply u s cotton growers will be ideally placed to benefit

6777662 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 of this country
6777663 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
6777664 we are here so that the world will know the truth
6777665 we have to remember those who died the tragic death from georgian aggression
6777666 its not like were carrying nuclear weapons and these surfboards arent much heavier than a carry on
6777667 its ridiculous when youre having to pay more for your board than the price of your airline ticket
6777668 we used to build civilisations now we build shopping malls
6777669 i dont normally buy books but im giving this a try its written by someone my age so im curious
6777670 theyre definitely a team that makes you pay for your mistakes
6777671 this is what we worked our entire lives in volleyball for
6777672 the confidence is there we know we can make great plays against great teams and were one of those great teams its a fantastic feeling
6777673 let his holy choirs sing in sodomy praise be surrender your body and soul unto him demoralize me so he crept into my room whispered my name took my innocence away im only five a perverts concubine god has a plan for us all ive been touched by the hand of god my sordid tale his lies are blasphemy you do not believe in him but he believes in you he wants you to repene all your sins let him in inside you god has a plan for us all you are one of gods children get on your knees serve him well my child ive fallen prey to the devil in disguise god has a plan for us all dont say a word or youll go to hell god has a plan for you all open up for him let jesus in his sordid tale his lies are blasphemy
6777674 he has important work to do and youre interfering with it
6777675 as soon as i can trust him not to interfere with the mortals
6777676 what bit about leaving the mortals with the free will didnt you understand you cant go around killing them for your mission and then binding their souls to cover your tracks its just not on
6777677 even a demon wont stoop so low we might stretch as far as possession but we havent freed a soul since the middle ages you were a good man what happened to you and dont say hell rubbed off on you because it doesnt
6777678 i was one of only two thousand caring for over one hundred and eighty million unbaptised infants you try dealing with that for seventeen centuries and see if you can keep the hands free policy in operation
6777679 i have to make golems non stop for the next eighteen months to house the spirits that will be dispossessed by the closure of limbo i expected the angels to be against me but demons that was a surprise
6777680 every soul you destroy is one we can no longer tempt and corrupt the whole cycle of creation is lessened when a soul is destroyed in such a manner that was why the elves were shunned and the djinns and efreets and the necromancers thats why the summoning of the celestial beings of any kind became a dark art punishable by an eternity of hot needles through the eyes
6777681 death and destruction is in your court isnt it thats why i came here to laverstone to this gullible little mind so intent on his wishes and promises and
6777682 demons dont hurt people demons torture souls yes but thats after theyre dead when theyve been judged unworthy to enter heaven
6777683 all of whom are summoned by the trumpeting angels look
6777684 all this is by the way you picked the wrong side to fight we dont want all the souls of limbo merging into hell to be lost the last thing we need are walls that cry when you pass and ask for their potty
6777685 and have millions of indestructible killing machines with the minds of toddlers in charge of them
6777686 you really didnt this through before you started did you
6777687 i did i gave this imbecile control of the greatest technological plant in the country to help me achieve the project in a realistic time frame
6777688 enough other religions believe in it even christians believe its possible else they wouldnt bang on about the second coming if you led all these souls in limbo to the rebirth canal youd solve all your problems theyd get their chance to free willed beings in their own right too
6777689 but it is technically possible see here are the gates of hell and here are the outer gates between the two are the twisting mazes of limbo
6777690 fortunately someone drew out attention to the drawings of mc escher and we realised that we were needlessly confining ourselves to one plane when we could utilise all six after that things got a little less crowded
6777691 my point is much of hell is leased from the other religions notable that of the greek and roman pantheons that means that theres a direct route from limbo to the birthing chambers where souls are inserted into the newborns
6777692 which means that you can send the inhabitants of limbo into new babies
6777693 the only problem is that all the souls will have to be submerged into the styx first we cant have them remembering their past life when theyre reborn we get enough of those leaking through already it was all right in the old days but then charon set up his ferry business and people started paying their way across so when they were born they still had their past life tucked away in a small corner of the brain even christians began remembering their past lives
6777694 if limbo is closing will you have time to rebirth them all
6777695 four billion souls in limbo 130 million babies born every year that makes just over thirty years of rebirths to cope with not counting the new souls lining up to be born lets say sixty years
6777696 it might be possible to shuffle the souls about for that long we could borrow a bit of tartarus maybe or deep freeze them in the ninth circle
6777697 so i dont need my legions of homunculi after all
6777698 though where you were going to keep four billion homunculi is anybodys guess
6777699 an infinite number of angels can dance on the head of a pin
6777700 but they have a distinct advantage over homunculi in that they get to be whatever size they want the trouble with you old son is that youve got a fourth century mind in a twenty first century body and its playing tricks with the old synapses
6777701 any chance of releasing me from these chains then now weve reached an amicable agreement
6777702 why have they got appendages when god didnt give the angels any
6777703 we used to say that demons hadnt got the brains they were born with
6777704 did he really think he was clever enough to negotiate with me
6777705 dominion over the earth is what i want i was promised it
6777706 the meek shall inherit the earth he said i was one of the meek and look what happened the church condemned me now im back and we will overthrow the church and rule in its stead
6777707 all edicts come from rome the church is all powerful
6777708 once i have built an army of these homunculi i can destroy the church and rewrite the missive that dissolves limbo and keep it open for eternity i can absolve original sin so that new babies are not sent to hell at all but go straight to heaven without even pause for judgement
6777709 were it not for the government theyll see your army and blow you to bits
6777710 thats why i had to go to the trouble of making homunculi instead of golems homunculi can reform themselves they are indestructible
6777711 you cant do this it will be seen as an act of aggression from britain youll precipitate a nuclear war the earth will be destroyed left to rot as a molten radioactive wasteland
6777712 we shall inherit it and i shall rebuild the world as god intended it i have studied the development of the modern world closely christian fights with muslim jew fights with hindi shinto fights with buddhist this world is what the devil made it it is all the result of satan and the pride of man im giving it a second chance at redemption
6777713 i must summon a brother into this new form i have prepared
6777714 hes a bit of a nutter if you ask me
6777715 a circle has to be collapsed by its maker and e looks like es got a lot of other stuff on his mind right now
6777716 three faces emanating from a single body form were inspired by african art the sad face on the left is painted naturalistically and weeps for the suffering of the slaves the highly stylized face on the right reflects the rage experienced by black women but expressed only at the risk of harsh punishment sometimes death the center face a highly decorated mask symbolizes the concealment of the real self required not only of black women but of their white sisters as well the upraised arm and clenched fist which complete sojourners portrait repeat the angry gesture she made in that ohio church
6777717 white women cant imagine black women have vaginas or if they can where imagination leads them is too far to go
6777718 teaching a slave to read would forever unfit him to be a slave
6777719 bad for democracy how the presidency undermines the power of the people
6777720 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6777721 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6777722 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6777723 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6777724 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer
6777725 because this is a celebration tickets prices will be shall we say retro
6777726 a lot of guessing goes into the decision and there should be more objective information
6777727 im not sure that this is the case at the moment
6777728 so i think the more information thats available to parents the better people will still make choices for a wide variety of reasons
6777729 i dont know where the four minutes of stoppage time came from and then he stopped time for the last minute
6777730 it was outside the box i think everybody saw that was clear
6777731 i think every time we get this referee we just have a bit of bad luck you know so thats unfortunate
6777732 i wasnt in charge then since ive been in charge anyway i wont say it i wont get myself into trouble i cant afford a fine we are not allowed to say anything
6777733 on the basis of it we were 3 2 down in injury time and to get out with a draw you should be feeling lucky but im not feeling lucky at all
6777734 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
6777735 youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
6777736 people dont have time to wait they need relief now so my attitude is lets build up the system we got lets make it more efficient we may be over time as we make the system more efficient and everybodys covered decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively
6777737 saying it would cover everyone take the profit out of health insurance and allow for greater efficiencies
6777738 republicans cringe at such deep government involvement in the private sector calling it socialized medicine
6777739 even though the nation is just three months away from electing a new president not nearly as much attention has been focused on health care reform as it deserves
6777740 harry and louise were effective in shooting down the clinton plan raising fears about government red tape
6777741 be as effective in prodding the nation to get sensible health care reform done
6777742 has focused too much on tax regimes and not enough on the real challenge health care
6777743 when it comes to domestic nonmilitary fiscal policy in the new millennium everything is dwarfed by health care
6777744 crucial long term fiscal problem facing the u s and its aging population is health care spending
6777745 what happens to taxes will largely be shaped by changes in the health insurance market
6777746 health care spending in the u s by both public and private sources is expected to expand from 16 of gdp to 40 of gdp in 2040
6777747 the pressure to reform americas broken down balkanized health care system isnt going to disappear
6777748 follow that debate and youll come to grips with what really matters when it comes to taxes and budget deficits
6777749 men are guardians of women because allah has made the one superior to the other and because they support them from their means

6777753 not only do i want an elite president i want someone whos embarrassingly superior to me
6777754 there were no parameters and you did what the hell you wanted up to legal and military limits
6777755 the more creative you were the more they liked it
6777756 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power

6777758 cigarette smoking has not at all relevant times satisfied the criteria applied from time to time by scientists and medical practitioners in order to conclude the activity is addictive
6777759 if the plaintiff had made the decision to quit smoking before 1997 his risk of contracting such injuries would have been substantially reduced or eliminated

6777777 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6777778 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year
6777779 we havent seen those prices reflected in the finished products yet

6777784 we are just a little concerned because you have two in one morning and the circumstances are similar
6777785 we want to get the word out to get the public to be more aware
6777786 what we are facing is a numbers shortage there is no way we will be able to survive at our current level if it continues like this
6777787 it will be impossible to have any improvement this season if we do not improve the numbers greatly
6777788 we also note that because consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice providers consistent with federal policy may block transmissions of illegal content e g child pornography or transmissions that violate copyright law to the extent however that providers choose to utilize practices that are not application or content neutral the risk to the open nature of the internet is particularly acute and the danger of network management practices being used to further anticompetitive ends is strong
6777789 considers whether the network management practice is intended to distinguish between legal and illegal activity the commissions network principles only recognize and protect users access to legal content the sharing of illegal content such as child pornography or content that does not have the appropriate copyright is not protected by our principles similarly applications that are intended to harm the network are not protected

6777795 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area around 2 30am to 2 45am or even before that time and may have seen or heard anything suspicious
6777796 this is a serious subject and its a roomful of serious people who have taken it in that manner
6777797 but for our part we continue to believe that this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and that meets indias energy needs
6777798 i dont think mccain is a particularly bad fellow but theres no reason to believe hes sufficiently clear of the bush cabal

6777970 and if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about rs 1 500 crore and because we have made this investment we will not move they are wrong because we would go whatever the cost
6777971 i made a major investment here to move is going to be a great cost to the company and great cost to tata motors shareholders and i think its going to be a great cost to west bengal
6777972 if there is a view that for various political reasons that we should not be here or what we are trying to do should be altered which it cannot be then well necessarily face an issue very reluctantly where we would need to move

6777982 garnham and some others went to the big end of town to try and convince the new government through the premier bob carr and they bypassed langton that they should impose upon the state rail authority a uk style of arrangement

6777988 doubtless garnham saw some opportunities there with bondi beach and the wizz and lend lease was pushing it my recollection was it was not taken seriously there was no evidence that a serious piece of work had been done on it
6777989 provided a number of briefings at this time on their lend leases proposal
6777990 years ago mr garnham spoke to me about an earlier version of wfr western fastrail we formed an arrangement and eventually approached leighton
6777991 when mr garnham returned to railcorp he immediately wrote to me terminating our arrangements
6777992 mr garnham has not been paid for this project nor is he entitled to any remuneration or success fees or any other financial arrangement
6777993 advised on this project from a railway operations perspective to mr easson from 2001
6777994 it was a commercially negotiated arrangement that was terminated when i joined railcorp in 2004
6777995 so far the work that has been done shows that it does not stack up for a number of reasons
6777996 one is that the cost that they estimate is not what we estimate it is several billion dollars more and if we accepted their proposal trains coming from the blue mountains would end up being slower and less frequent we are not going to do that we think there is a better solution
6777997 the construction cost estimates were entirely fanciful at 2 billion to 2 5 billion that is just bollocks
6777998 in early 2007 mr col gellatly wrote to me stating that the government would set up a working party that he would chair to review the feasibility of the project
6777999 mr costa is the minister for infrastructure and we met him a number of times to discuss the proposal at meetings in his office

6778168 even though the central government had been indifferent to our repeated request for additional resources and had also flatly refused to concede our demand for a special package of rs 80000 crore still we decided to mobilise our own resources to meet the additional burden that the new pay scales would entail
6778169 while the arrears were estimated at about rs 14800 crore the annual burden on the state exchequer would be about rs 5200 crore
6778170 but we will make it a point to meet that by enhancing our pending recoveries and by plugging wastages rest assured we will not levy any fresh taxes on the people of the state

6778204 but what of the mentality of the personality at the centre of this rather feable cult
6778205 former labour mp leo abseclaerly agrees with the latter thesis in all but one respect blair isnt devious hes mad
6778206 as with his previous work on margaret thatcher abse locates the source of his subjects psychosis in a dysfunctional childhood and an ambivalent relationship with a domineering father
6778207 most of this stuff is of course no more than highly speculative psycho babble
6778208 as you have probably gathered by now this book is essentially a gutsy old labour diatribe against the blair entry job on the party and its accompanying personality cult
6778209 and it suggested to this reviewer that in campaigning to destroy tony blair the politician we are bringing a life affirming catharsis to tony blair the human being
6778210 he was a very good player for us for a while probably our best player for a period of time so id like to see him get back to that level murphy and evans will stay in left field and tatis will probably spell ryan in right field against left handed pitchers to keep him sharp youll have two or three ways to choose from depending on who gets hot or who has a good matchup

6778215 i think pedro has the gift of instincts probably the greatest instincts of any pitcher in our era knowing how when and what to do outweighs talent at times but eventually talent catches up when bobby cox had greg maddux hed throw 80 something pitches and go pretty deep but then he didnt want to send him through the lineup another time pedro is getting there at some point where does his trickology go from there

6778219 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6778220 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6778225 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6778226 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

6778228 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6778229 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6778230 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6778231 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6778232 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6778233 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6778234 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6778235 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6778236 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6778237 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6778238 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6778239 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6778240 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6778241 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6778242 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6778243 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6778244 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6778245 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6778246 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6778247 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6778248 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6778249 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6778250 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6778251 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6778252 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6778253 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6778254 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6778255 who are open to doing something on the production side
6778256 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6778257 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6778258 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6778259 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6778260 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6778261 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6778262 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6778263 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6778264 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6778265 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6778266 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6778267 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6778268 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6778269 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6778270 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6778271 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6778272 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6778273 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6778274 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6778275 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6778276 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6778277 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6778278 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6778279 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6778280 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6778281 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6778282 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6778283 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6778284 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6778352 die chevrolets scheinen in oschersleben immer recht gut zu laufen
6778353 wir hatten dort sehr positive wintertests also habe ich allen grund dazu optimistisch zu sein nicola und ich werden nach unserer pechstr ne in brands hatch zu den leichtesten wagen im feld z hlen
6778354 das erste ziel des wochenendes muss daher lauten das auto in die erste startreihe zu stellen
6778355 diese ausgangslage w rde ich dann gerne in einen sieg im ersten rennen und in einige weitere punkte in lauf zwei umm nzen oschersleben ist eine enge kurvenreiche und sehr technische strecke dieser kurstyp scheint unseren wagen immer zu liegen meiner meinung nach ist es eine gro artige fahrerstrecke deshalb habe ich einen sieg ins visier genommen
6778356 ich habe beinahe 60 kilogramm ballast an bord das rennen wird f r mich also in erster linie taktisch gepr gt sein
6778357 es ist gewiss nicht leicht auf einer technisch so anspruchvollen rennstrecke wie oschersleben gro zu taktieren aber ich w re schon zufrieden wenn ich mit ein paar punkten aus beiden rennen nach hause kommen w rde
6778358 aber nat rlich muss man auch sehen dass in den engen kurven immer einiges los ist
6778359 sollte den anderen also ein missgeschick passieren dann k nnten wir vielleicht auch f r eine berraschung gut sein
6778360 meine zielsetzung f r oschersleben ist nach wie vor mich dort gut zu pr sentieren
6778361 allerdings ist es in diesem jahr ziemlich schwierig eine vorhersage zu treffen wir m ssen also einfach abwarten und schauen wie sich die dinge entwickeln in oschersleben gibt es eine ganze reihe von sehr langsamen und kniffligen ecken wo man lackaustausch beinahe nicht vermeiden kann puebla ist hnlich und dort habe ich gut abgeschnitten
6778362 ich bin also sehr motiviert zumindest mein resultat aus mexiko zu wiederholen vor allem nach einem so tollen sommerurlaub es wird auch gro artig sein endlich wieder vor der wahrscheinlich gr ten chevrolet fangemeinde in der wtcc zu fahren

6778364 uk economic growth has chugged along quite nicely thanks to rising consumer spending which has largely been on credit
6778365 while most of the debt is perfectly serviceable and secured on dwellings the rising number of insolvencies and repossessions is testament to this process having a negative outcome for an increasing number of individuals
6778366 it will be the next six to 12 months which reveal how seriously the credit crunch has affected individuals

6778376 there is huge waste and loss of water through food that is produced since roughly 50 percent of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted
6778377 there is a need for a mentality shift it would make a lot of sense for people to waste less
6778378 that corresponds to 40 trillion litres of irrigation water enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6778379 in many areas of the world you simply cannot store food efficiently because it is not handled well
6778380 in urban settings we have lost touch with realities people do not know where food comes from they do not know what it takes to produce food
6778381 now if you throw away half of that kilo that means youve thrown away 7 5 tonnes of water
6778382 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
6778383 gone down by 30 percent because the price went up
6778384 we pay a price here for water that is not very high but we also couple that with education and awareness so people know there is a cost to the environment to use that water
6778385 larger percentage of patients treated with vytorin were diagnosed with and died from all types of cancer combined when compared to treatment with a placebo
6778386 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6778387 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6778388 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6778389 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6778390 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6778391 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers

6778402 the united states maintained about 130 military advisers in georgia along with civilian advisers contractors involved in all aspects of the georgian government and people doing business in georgia it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier u s technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions the russians clearly knew the georgians were ready to move how could the united states not be aware of the russians indeed given the posture of russian troops how could intelligence analysts have missed the possibility that the russians had laid a trap hoping for a georgian invasion to justify its own counterattack

6778458 circuito valencia es rapid simo nada que ver con m naco
6778459 es un trazado impresionante muy diferente a los dem s ser emocionante porque no estamos acostumbrados a l se parece al de m naco por ser urbano pero tambi n tiene rectas estupendas como el de bahrein por poner un ejemplo me gusta mucho la ciudad y estoy seguro de que la gente se divertir el domingo
6778460 pero seguro que a partir de ma ana estar todo bien
6778461 tengo que mirar hacia adelante estuve cerca de ganar la ltima carrera pero ahora lo m s importante es volver a ser competitivo desde la clasificaci n hasta el final de la carrera tengo un coche fant stico tenemos buena velocidad punta y pienso que reunimos todas las condiciones para estar arriba de nuevo aunque el objetivo principal es ser consistentes
6778462 un grupo que ven a de ganar casi todos los partidos
6778463 no hay que perder la perspectiva y hay que saber que estos son partidos amistosos y de pretemporada aunque no me gusta perder ni en los amistosos pero debemos seguir adelante sacar lo positivo y trabajar y seguir mejorando
6778464 hacer un buen partido y poder tener una semana tranquila
6778465 circuito valencia es rapid simo nada que ver con m naco
6778466 de cualquier forma todos los pilotos estamos en las mismas condiciones desde luego nosotros hemos preparado a conciencia esta carrera pero las impresiones que tendremos en pista a partir de ma ana ser n fundamentales

6778476 circuito valencia es rapid simo nada que ver con m naco
6778477 a ver si se puede intentar que todos los pilotos nos podamos juntar en el pit lane antes de salir ma ana a los entrenamientos y guardar un minuto de silencio creo que es lo m nimo que podemos hacer pero no depende ni de m ni de los pilotos estas cosas se mueven por otros sitios
6778478 el circuito de valencia es una mezcla entre los de m naco y bahrein
6778479 he tenido muy buena sensaci n lo conoc a por v deos de las carreras de hace un mes de gt y f3 de los planos que ten a pero caminando y vi ndolo in situ he confirmado la idea que ten a
6778480 dif cil denominarlo urbano es un semi permanente normal y corriente pero con las vallas pegadas en las rectas es el polo opuesto a m naco
6778481 diferente a m naco o a lo que ser singapur
6778482 hay tramos ciegos pero en teor a las banderas amarillas tendr an que ayudar en caso de que en una curva que no pudieras ver a la salida si hay alguien parado
6778483 del mismo modo continu hay partes que se estrechan bastante como la zona del puente pero son los riesgos y trampas que tiene todo circuito urbano m naco no permite ning n error y valencia pese a ser m s ancho menos bacheado y estar todo m s calculado no va a permitir tampoco errores esa es la salsa de los circuitos urbano
6778484 a trescientos kil metros por hora va a cambiar mucho respecto a las sensaciones al caminarlo hoy se va a volver todo m s estrecho y m s dif cil pero as a priori es de esos circuitos que te gustan bien preparado todo calculado a estrenar todo nuevo
6778485 de hecho prosigui hay curvas que ahora piensas que son de una manera y luego te subes al coche y algunas partes no tienen nada que ver con lo que hab as programado cuando te subas seguro que hay sorpresas pero lo m s importante es aprovechar las tres horas que tendremos de entrenamiento para dar el mayor n mero de vueltas para tener m s confianza
6778486 est claro que espa a est al frente de automovilismo y otros deportes
6778487 he llegado aqu con sacrificio y humildad y me siento uno m s

6778491 la que viene es una semana importante para nosotros perder amos todo el trabajo de la pretemporada si no pasamos la eliminatoria el equipo es consciente de lo que se juega hay que ir con la intenci n de ganar sabemos que nos espera un ambiente dif cil y el equipo tiene que estar preparado para ganar y volver a europa
6778492 el deportivo demostr que fue superior al rival pero no pudo meter gol hay que mantener la l nea en croacia y el gol llegar tarde o temprano el favorito tiene que seguir siendo el deportivo aqu vinieron a encerrarse atr s y si quieren pasar tendr n que arriesgar as que eso nos tiene que favorecer
6778493 la gente pensaba que el hajduk iba a ser un equipo m s flojo pero aqu nos cost meter un gol defensivamente estaban bien y aunque no es un mal equipo no es superior al deportivo as que si queremos seguir en europa hay que ganar

6778497 buyplexus com is unique because it benefits both the shopper and business owner
6778498 shoppers have a place to find the products or services theyre interested in and merchants can utilize the sites marketing tools to generate additional exposure in the search engines and social media networks weve created a powerful shopping portal in buyplexus com thats capable of rivaling some of the most popular online
6778499 the free business directory promotion is designed to allow more users to experience the benefits of the network and build a significant advertiser base weve had a great response so far
6778500 since buyplexus com was built with the new web 2 0 marketing standards in mind we were able to augment the listings with additional components like business blogs rss feeds google maps photo galleries reviews comments and social media functionality
6778501 our designers and developers knew savvy marketers would appreciate these extra features and they did a great job integrating them into the site
6778502 the goal with buyplexus is to enable anyone to post and search products and services not just business owners
6778503 many competitors simply dont allow people to take advantage of a networks popularity without paying high fees or having an established business so we made sure buyplexus was accessible to everyone and didnt exclude those users
6778504 we hope the launch of buyplexus com shows our continued commitment to being a resource for everyone not just our clients
6778505 in terms of advertising a business we know the best approach to marketing is a comprehensive one so buyplexus certainly meets that need by providing so many options

6778591 i dont think thats something that we want to do thats why we close practice so that the other team cant see us we got on the internet to see if we could see any of clemsons plays from their scrimmage and didnt see any thats not what people usually do when youre getting ready to play a game to advertise on tv or the internet im not pleased about it but its something that can be corrected and it wont happen again i dont think the person that did it did it intentionally
6778592 i attend all classes with an open mind and with a positive attitude to learn im excited to learn something new every day my education is important to me im committed to seizing the opportunities that have been given to me i maintain a 3 5 gpa i take the time to study realizing that it is the reiteration that helps me to assimilate what it is im learning
6778593 we need to support barack obama and his quest for the oval office
6778594 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
6778595 the message is for a kid from marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
6778596 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
6778597 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
6778598 we really want change we really need it its not the same no more
6778599 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
6778600 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
6778601 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
6778602 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
6778603 the most problematic hip hop gets 90 percent of the coverage in the non music press
6778604 hip hop is associated in so many peoples minds with crime drugs and misogyny so obamas faced with a constellation of problematic images the question is how do you send a message that doesnt wind up demonizing somebody
6778605 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
6778606 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
6778607 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big
6778608 during this election young people from all walks of life have responded to senator obamas message of hope and change for the future with great enthusiasm
6778609 and that includes those in the hip hop community individuals who are talented intelligent and entrepreneurial in spirit but who in the past have felt that government and politics dont really work for them
6778610 senator obama wants to engage the hip hop community more in the political process because issues including education jobs and health care are as important to this generation as any other we will be talking to the hip hop community more throughout this campaign and letting them know they have reason to put their trust in senator obama because he will work to fundamentally change their lives
6778611 the hip hop experience is for some the black experience and the campaign has been very inclusive and has been one that has welcomed voices from all over the country
6778612 with the hip hop community its been an interesting conversation because on the one hand we know the hip hop community has reflected a great deal of whats been happening in our inner cities for a long time and the systemic challenges that face that community senator obama has a plan as part of his overall call for change that will address those challenges the voice of the hip hop community will be reflected in this campaign with senator obamas plan for inner city communities
6778613 these situations are a case by case basis when and where and timing
6778614 the hip hop community has clearly embraced senator obama and they see him as someone who can effect change in a dramatic way the key with us as we go through the next few months is identifying opportunities where we can work together to communicate the senators message
6778615 i thought about hip hop associations harming obamas chances i really did
6778616 so in the concert i always say this is not sponsored by obama i make it very clear to say that cause i know obama associated with this guy from f in marcy projects i know thats coming any day i think about that often i mean what do you do what do i do i have to support the guy but i dont wanna hurt him i aint like the preachers and all those guys i dont wanna make the inappropriate statements and keep going im the guy that will fall back
6778617 you gotta speak what you feel you gotta be respectful though
6778618 like anything you do you cant come to anybodys show and be disrespectful if youre supporting them so you dont speak on nobody and act a fool
6778619 in some ways you have to assume most of the hip hop community will be behind him because they dont have a choice because their vote aint going to mccain
6778620 but if he uses this kind of secret code the dirt off the shoulder saying you and i both know it but i cant afford to say so it could work for him
6778621 rappers have to realize that supporting obama publicly is like a corporate meeting come support us but dress for the occasion
6778622 if a king goes out and fights wars with his people his people will do anything for him

6778624 a lot of people may not feel me on this but you gotta feel me if you real im not voting for obama
6778625 i dont like obama obama is a traitor he turned his back on everybody he turned his back on reverend jeremiah wright reverend wright has been with him since the beginning ludacris has done stuff in his support he speaks the truth but obama feels that a certain demographic may not vote for him because of it so he turns his back on luda bernie mac he invited bernie mac to come in and do his roast or whatever it was called bernie mac said some things that were offensive thats what bernie mac is known for what does he do turn his back on bernie mac whos he gonna denounce next im not even voting this year if i did vote it would be for mccain i like to know the enemy barack i dont know
6778626 while nancy pelosi and house democrats are partying in denver families in hampton roads and on the eastern shore are still feeling the pinch every time they fill up their gas tank

6778635 one of the biggest insights is the statement that medicine is a team sport particularly on the in patient setting it seems to be about how the team is providing care and its no longer an individual sport
6778636 we have a principle called subsidiarity which means that the decisions should be made as close to where the actual process or issue is it can be made so that decisions are not made at the highest levels of the organization but at the actual levels of the organization thats most appropriate where the most knowledgeable people are going to be making the right decision

6778663 the home and lot sales closed on june 15 2005 a land trust controlled by the obamas bought the house for 1 65 million and the obamas secured a 1 32 million mortgage from northern trust to complete that purchase that same day rezkos wife rita rezko bought the side lot for 625 000 a 37 000 a year cook county employee she secured a 500 000 mortgage from mutual bank of harvey
6778664 obama i trusted rezko senator says friend raised more money than previously known
6778665 seven months later january 2006 wanting a bigger yard for his 1 65 million house obama bought a slice of the rezko property for 104 500
6778666 what looks bad about the transaction is the fact that the transaction occurred at all tony rezko was headed for trouble he was clearly in the crosshairs of the federal government
6778667 so what were left with is a question of you know really what was he thinking and the warning signs to stay away were very clear
6778668 senator obama was very slow to walk away from tony rezko
6778669 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6778670 the parcel included an adjacent lot which obama told the chicago tribune he could not afford because it was already a stretch to buy the house

6778676 not a favor as a state senator he went to bat for now indicted developers deal
6778677 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the chicago tribune that in all the years hes known rezko ive never done any favors for him

6778685 saya telah membandingkan teks asal artikel ini di dalam asiaweek dengan terjemahan ke dalam bahasa melayu yang dipaparkan di aidc dan saya mendapati penterjemahan itu sedikit kurang tepat
6778686 i have read the satanic verses i also read midnights children much earlier i think hes a profound writer i disagree with him in the satanic verses but you have to deal with this situation first its a literary piece and second i think any ruling on any ill doing of any person must be determined by a court of law i dont believe its legitimate for someone to make a pronouncement to condemn any person if countries dispute the writings of salman it should be brought to trial in malaysia we chose just to ban the book because if it werent there would be riots do you want to defend one man and have so many people killed but these decisions are difficult because if theres no freedom of expression then people feel intimidated every time they touch on whats considered to be a sensitive issue
6778687 saya telah membaca the satanic verses saya juga telah membaca midnights children lebih awal lagi dari itu saya menganggap dia salman rushdie adalah seorang penulis yang menampakkan pengetahuan dan pemahaman yang mendalam saya tidak bersetuju dengannya salman mengenai the satanic verses tetapi anda harus merungkai situasi ini pertama ia adalah sebuah karya sastera dan kedua saya beranggapan bahawa apa apa hukuman ke atas salah laku sesiapa pun mesti ditentukan oleh sebuah mahkamah undang undang saya tidak percaya adalah patut bagi seseorang untuk membuat pengumuman untuk mengutuk seseorang jika negara negara mempertikaikan penulisan salman ia seharusnya dibawa ke muka pengadilan di malaysia kami memilih hanya untuk mengharamkan buku itu kerana jika tidak akan berlakunya rusuhan adakah anda mahu mempertahankan satu orang dan mengakibatkan ramai orang lain terbunuh tetapi keputusan keputusan ini adalah sukar kerana sekiranya tiada kebebasan bersuara maka orang ramai akan berasa tertekan setiap kali mereka menyentuh apa yang dianggap sebagai isu sensitif
6778688 i think hes a profound writer i disagree with him
6778689 saya telah membaca the satanic verses saya juga telah membaca midnights children lebih awal lagi dari itu
6778690 saya menganggap dia salman rushdie adalah seorang penulis yang menampakkan pengetahuan dan pemahaman yang mendalam
6778691 saya tidak bersetuju dengannya salman mengenai the satanic verses tetapi anda harus merungkai situasi ini pertama ia adalah sebuah karya sastera dan kedua saya beranggapan bahawa apa apa hukuman ke atas salah laku sesiapa pun mesti ditentukan oleh sebuah mahkamah undang undang
6778692 saya tidak percaya adalah patut bagi seseorang untuk membuat pengumuman untuk mengutuk seseorang jika negara negara mempertikaikan penulisan salman ia seharusnya dibawa ke muka pengadilan
6778693 di malaysia kami memilih hanya untuk mengharamkan buku itu kerana jika tidak akan berlakunya rusuhan adakah anda mahu mempertahankan satu orang dan mengakibatkan ramai orang lain terbunuh
6778694 tetapi keputusan keputusan ini adalah sukar kerana sekiranya tiada kebebasan bersuara maka orang ramai akan berasa tertekan setiap kali mereka menyentuh apa yang dianggap sebagai isu sensitif
6778695 saya tidak percaya adalah patut bagi seseorang untuk membuat pengumuman untuk mengutuk seseorang jika negara negara mempertikaikan penulisan salman ia seharusnya dibawa ke muka pengadilan
6778696 his fourth novel the satanic verses 1988 led to protests from muslims in several countries some of which were violent faced with death threats and a fatw religious edict issued by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini then supreme leader of iran which called for him to be killed he spent nearly a decade largely underground appearing in public only sporadically
6778697 when ayatollah khomeini called on all zealous muslims to execute the writer and the publishers of the book rushdie was forced into hiding also an aide to khomeini offered a million dollar reward for rushdies death in 1993 rushdies norwegian publisher william nygaard was wounded in an attack outside his house in 1997 the reward was doubled and the next year the highest iranian state prosecutor morteza moqtadale renewed the death sentence during this period of fatwa violent protest in india pakistan and egypt caused several deaths
6778698 the publication in 1988 of his fourth novel the satanic verses lead to accusations of blasphemy against islam and demonstrations by islamist groups in india and pakistan the orthodox iranian leadership issued a fatwa against rushdie on 14 february 1989 effectively a sentence of death and he was forced into hiding under the protection of the british government and police
6778699 saya beranggapan bahawa apa apa hukuman ke atas salah laku sesiapa pun mesti ditentukan oleh sebuah mahkamah undang undang saya tidak percaya adalah patut bagi seseorang untuk membuat pengumuman untuk mengutuk seseorang jika negara negara mempertikaikan penulisan salman ia seharusnya dibawa ke muka pengadilan
6778700 whats different from past events is how major muslim leaders are condemning it
6778701 the ayatollah khomeinis condemning of novelist salman rushdie to death for blasphemy for his satanic verses combined with iraqi president saddam husseins call for a holy war against the west during the 1991 persian gulf war reinforce fears of a political and cultural confrontation
6778702 it should now be clear that we are facing a mood and a movement far transcending the level of issues and policies and the governments that pursue them this is no less than a clash of civilizations a perhaps irrational but surely historic reaction of an ancient rival against our judaeo christian heritage our secular present and the worldwide expansion of both

6778705 antibiotics continue to be used responsibly by the veterinary profession and livestock farmers for the benefit of animal health and welfare

6778707 this would help to safeguard the future effectiveness of critically important drugs and over the coming years save countless human lives

6778833 we refuse to live within our means we continue to think that the problems that beset the country are out there beyond our borders and that if we deploy sufficient amount of american power we can fix those problems and therefore things back here will continue as they have for decades
6778834 the big problem with the current crisis in american foreign policy is that unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
6778835 the united states today finds itself threatened by three interlocking crises the first of these crises is economic and cultural the second political and the third military all three share this characteristic they are of our own making
6778836 the collective capacity of our domestic political economy to satisfy americas appetites has not kept pace with demand
6778837 with americans even in war time refusing to curb their appetites
6778838 the long war in iraq and afghanistan aggravates the economic contradictions that continue to produce debt and dependency the iraq war deserves our attention as the clearest manifestation of these three crises demonstrating the extent to which they are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing that war was always unnecessary of perhaps even greater significance it is both counterproductive and unsustainable
6778839 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people
6778840 is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad
6778841 rather than insisting that the world accommodate the united states americans need to reassert control over their own destiny ending their condition of dependency and abandoning their imperial delusions
6778842 of perhaps even greater difficulty the combination of economic political and military crisis summons americans to reexamine exactly what freedom entails soldiers cannot accomplish these tasks nor should we expect politicians to do so the onus of responsibility falls squarely on citizens
6778843 we look to the president to the next president you know we know that the current presidents a failure and a disappoint we look to the next president to fix things and of course as long as we have this expectation that the next president is going to fix things then of course that lifts all responsibility from me to fix things

6778865 self identified white bahamian as deputy prime minister has raised the fear that the oppressive force that was fractured in 1967 will return and change the bahamas back to what it was before majority rule
6778866 self identified white bahamian as deputy prime minister has given white bahamians a chance to feel as though they belong in the bahamas again
6778867 there are still churches and clubs and parks and professions and schools that are avoided by whites and blacks
6778868 even the loyalist memorial garden erected by the whites in 1983 symbolises the communitys racial segregation with its central icon a heroic loyalist woman waving the union flag and a loyal female slave a suitable step or two behind
6778869 within new providence residential segregation is evident although racial lines in many instances have been obscured or even subsumed by class values
6778870 while it is true that there has been some integration by blacks into traditionally white communities the degree of social interaction between the races is questionable
6778871 a recent survey in 2003 suggests that many bahamians still prefer to live in ethnically homogenous communities accordingly only 58 of respondents lived in a residential area with persons of another race and only 50 of persons living in an all white or all black community would consider living in a mixed residential area
6778872 today except for a handful of government officials the entire population of the original settlement remains conchy joe white the majority are blood relations and more than one quarter rejoice in the single surname pinder similar configurations albeit with a higher sprinkling of blacks are also found on the offshore cays in the abacos including guana cay elbow cay man o war cay and the mainland settlement of cherokee while the obvious and explicit forms of racism may have subsided in these communities their values and preference for living apart from others encourages social distancing and latent forms of racism
6778873 a conversation that white bahamians by and large either want to dismiss with common phrases such as i dont think about race race doesnt come into it or were over that or become defensive and speak of reverse racism that the tables have turned and white people are now the victims of black oppression

6778875 how many young officers actually smoke dope and steal more money just like street thugs
6778876 it had been alleged by trustworthy sources in the know that certain police officers have guarded the beach side estates of certain drug dealers
6778877 just look at the disappearance of some 50 kilos of cocaine that was on the lorequin and the poor investigation that followed the 1984 commission of inquiry revealed much about corruption if established politicians could easily fall for drug money unless a young police or defense force officer is strong and from a solid family he wont be able to resist the drug culture and we all know that the family structure today is broken

6778998 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
6778999 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
6779000 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
6779001 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases
6779002 we want to observe the development of marine coastal ecosystems in the face of global climate change not only an increased ultraviolet radiation plays a decisive role but also the water temperature which has been increased by the greenhouse effect this increase in temperature can particularly be felt on spitsbergen in the atlantic sector of the arctic

6779045 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6779046 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker

6779062 when more than 10 percent of a community opts out of vaccinations it leaves the entire community at risk because germs have a greater chance of causing an epidemic

6779122 she explained this to the manager the assistant manager and to the bouncer who originally asked her and they still removed her
6779123 they said they needed to see her face because of the trouble they had in there she is a 30 year old woman not a young hoodie
6779124 surely this sort of thing should be at the managers discretion
6779125 clearly this is a very unfortunate incident and we have every sympathy with mrs randalls situation and admire the way she is overcoming her adversity
6779126 when requesting that her baseball cap was removed it was explained that the policy was stated on the front doors of the building

6779128 tenpin prides itself on the secure environment we provide for families and regularly liaise with the local police in our endeavour to maintain high levels of safety

6779134 the goal is to restore the healthy self image again so that that person can see themselves whole

6779136 to deliver an artificial limb or brace without follow up doesnt help that person in the long run

6779140 it opens a whole other door for many of these folks to experience the world in a way in which theyve never even dreamt of

6779144 if you learn how to act im in deep trouble
6779145 the biggest stunt i always say on the indiana jones films was stopping harrison doing the stunts because i had to fight nearly every time to stop him
6779146 i had to rely on a horse and horses have a sense of survival and they dont actually do what you tell them to do as they havent read the script

6779533 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6779534 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6779535 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world

6779573 i told somebody one time if they started a league called the backyard league where you threw a football into the backyard and you let guys choose up teams and make their own rules and play football the first two guys i would choose on my team are steve tasker and doug flutie
6779574 they know how to play the game probably because they are small they have been forced to figure out ways to be good they dont need somebody to tell them what to do they would figure it out they would be inventive creative and be two of the best players in that league and i think justin is a little like that all his life he has been forced to overachieve and make things work because he is not as tall as everyone else
6779575 to have much of an impact in north america either with the tech industry or with consumers lord knows that it s trying by moving its cto to palo alto it s also clear that nokia as the most aggressive us university outreach program of any mobile phone company with multi man year efforts at stanford ucla and mit but its handset share and mindshare are almost off the radar
6779576 nokia and with it symbian so far has lost in the us market including the high end smartphone market that they dominate in the global market
6779577 the iphone and blackberry are winners and nokia is an also ran the question that the europeans and japanese and koreans are asking is so what
6779578 the so what is that before the iphone efforts to kickstart the mobile internet have largely failed at least in the developed countries operators and manufacturers come up with all sorts of technologies and businesses but they re not getting adopted
6779579 the iphone is getting used and is getting the mobile internet adopted
6779580 nokia and its soon to be subsidiary symbian can continue to shoot at the messenger or they can respond to the iphone challenge by making their products easier to use and more compelling
6779581 my hunch is that apple has at least another year or two before nokia gets its software act together and if nokia doesn t then microsoft rim lg or samsung will so as when it faced windows 95 apple better have something up its sleeve to further advance innovations when competitors catch up to its first mobile phone act
6779582 my hunch is that apple has at least another year or two before insert company name gets its software act together and if insert company name here doesn t then company a b c or d will

6779589 the majority of serial killers are not reclusive social misfits who live alone they are not monsters and may not appear strange serial murderers often have families and homes are gainfully employed and appear to be normal members of the community
6779590 contrary to popular belief serial killers span all racial groups there are white african american hispanic and asian serial killers the racial diversification of serial killers generally mirrors that of the overall u s population
6779591 all serial murders are not sexually based there are many other motivations for serial murders including anger thrill financial gain and attention seeking
6779592 with all due respect it is very easy for ceos executives and politicians who all have paid sick days themselves to oppose them for everyone else
6779593 apparently they think paid sick days are unworkable and economically harmful only if regular people are able to earn them
6779594 lets put aside the fact that mccains top foreign policy adviser randy scheunemann has in fact been a lobbyist for georgia in his own feisty comments in recent months mccain encouraged georgians to believe america would back them up in a crisis that expectation was naive and it was wrong to encourage it it was especially wrong to give a volatile leader such as saakashvili what he evidently imagined was an american blank check
6779595 he also has a keen sense of the importance of a british prime minister something that will lead him as it did blair into a more interventionist stance if elected and closer to washington still the locus of global power

6779598 these findings affirm what were hearing from our business partners who are on the front lines with midmarket companies the fastest growing sector of the economy
6779599 i think that when it comes to losing data because of viruses hackers or other threats that definitely is a top concern and i would agree with the arrow survey security outweighs cost concern
6779600 these are often fast growing enterprises and while theyre cost conscious they often cant get the leverage a big company can get out of cost cutting measures
6779601 i believe that the 32 percent of respondents that are very satisfied with how their company is addressing security concerns are deluding themselves they should wake up and smell the coffee
6779602 as an industry since 2000 weve spent billions on security in the form of virus protection network security firewalls and other infrastructure do you feel more secure no way
6779603 the gap between our ability to manage complexity and the rate of complexity growth is widening not shrinking making us less secure
6779604 for the midmarket guys i talk to technology is not the problem
6779605 its the skills and best practice knowledge as to how to apply the technology to create business systems that is what is lacking at midmarket firms

6779821 really early in his presidential campaign when i got the opportunity to listen intently to his ideas and his platforms i immediately said this is beyond belief
6779822 i joined the effort and it became clear to me that i was better able to work in my community in a broad way and support this outstanding candidate as a democrat

6779846 and he is dedicating himself to making sure that dream stays alive for generations of americans to come
6779847 it is imperative that we recognize that john mccain has stood against efforts to promote equal pay for equal work

6779910 its not as if colleges are like football teams that can play on a field to decide a winner
6779911 rankings are just one filter families can use to narrow down their choices
6779912 our academic excellence close faculty student interaction and commitment to a values driven education result in our placement in many national rankings and were proud of that
6779913 at the same time we encourage parents and students not to base their selection of a university on just one measure
6779914 they also should be looking at the schools location appearance cost facilities and the academic program within their major
6779915 neil has changed it about similarly to ourselves so hell be deeming it a period of transition

6779923 usually assistants are young folks out of law school who are excited to learn not a way station for retreads whove been criticized for their less than sterling defense of voting rights laws
6779924 todd knows hans because todd works at the heritage foundation and hans contributes to the heritage foundation he has written some things about voting rights
6779925 we have never seen a political appointee exercise this level of control over the day to day operations of the voting section
6779926 voting rights policies not seen before pushing to curb minor instances of election fraud by imposing sweeping restrictions that would make it harder not easier for democratic leaning poor and minority voters to cast ballots
6779927 we have two reports dealing with voting rights that are yet to be published and my concern is what role he will have in regard to those reports
6779928 does not have any more work to be done on the voting rights briefing
6779929 the man utd draw gives us a platform to build on
6779930 if we get performances like that with that commitment we will beat most teams at home
6779931 we must not get carried away because its only one game but it was a terrific performance and the challenge now is can we go and play at home like that
6779932 if we can nobody will beat us much at st james park
6779933 i will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity
6779934 what you do is as important as anything government does i ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort
6779935 together we will reclaim americas schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives
6779936 i was shocked really ive been in smaller competitions going to bolton shows but it was only this year that ive tried something bigger
6779937 i wasnt expecting much because id not been to one before
6779938 right this credit crisis is going to cause significant pain for consumers and businesses alike we need to find a way to help them remain agile in these difficult times
6779939 ive got an idea lets introduce a bill which will create lots of red tape with lots of lovely bureaucracy and then we can employ even more civil servants from the pool of laid off workers to manage it
6779940 while he is not likely to be involved on saturday he should be ready for the champions league game on wednesday night we will have to assess him on monday or tuesday to see how big a gamble it will be to start him or not
6779941 hes trained with us for the past two days and im going to put him on the bench on saturday
6779942 tugay can definitely play a part for us not just on the field but off the field
6779943 the lads look up to him and its important that even if hes not playing hes making sure things are right in the dressing room and stuff like that but when he does comes on his variety of passing is different class and im pleased ive got him for another year
6779944 it was slightly different for me because i was more of a tackler a box to box player so my legs used to go and id struggle a bit
6779945 tugay is not that sort of player hes more of a sprayer and runs the game that way
6779946 i dont want to tempt fate but in the first three games this season the defence is looking a lot more solid
6779947 we conceded too many goals last season it was a big problem for us but i think we are seeing an improvement
6779948 were looking more solid with colin murdock being there hes got the experience and ability to organise
6779949 weve not really had that since mark sertori came to the club when we were going for the unibond title he gave us that experience
6779950 its been a jolt but i think thats then a test of peoples character
6779951 they had a head of steam and everything was going well and rosy in the garden and then all of a sudden bang
6779952 and really weve caused our own problems its been self inflicted not because weve been massively outplayed by everybody
6779953 youd love to pinpoint one thing thats been at the root of it
6779954 its probably down to individual errors and within that theres not been a good goal scored against us when i look back
6779955 but were not going to look to apportion blame were going to regroup stick together and come out the other side of it and well be better for it
6779956 when you do that that feeling will be better because you know what youve been through
6779957 theres no getting away from it its been disappointing and hurtful but you either feel sorry for yourself or come in and be prepared to work hard and show what youre all about
6779958 it certainly wasnt the start youd envisaged but its happened so its how you deal with it
6779959 i think hand on heart theres a level of frustration if you were going to ask them individually if any of them think theyve been on top of their game some of them would think theyre doing okay but certainly not collectively
6779960 sometimes youve got to give yourself a chance in the game and theyve not done that because of the goals were conceding you cant keep asking them to come back from two goals down
6779961 they know if they keep it tight theyre well capable of beating anyone in this championship
6779962 theyve worked hard but when you cross the white line thats when they have to deliver
6779963 that should be the signal to go and express yourself and show what youre all about and thats what were asking
6779964 the biggest thing is and i dont just mean this for defenders but all over the pitch i think its about individuals taking responsibility and if you are for whatever reason caught in a defensive area whether you be a forward player or not its your turn to take that individual responsibility and make sure your opponent isnt getting a shot at goal youre not letting him into any space
6779965 weve spoken about it and when were in those defending areas youre going to have to do that from time to time particularly in this championship
6779966 its important that you take that responsibility on board and youre ready to stand up and be counted if youre going to give anything up someones going to earn it against you youre not going to gift it and hand it on a plate all too often thats what weve been doing
6779967 we have to make sure were doing our job because theyre all allocated where they should be and if everyone had done what they were asked it wouldnt have been a problem
6779968 it was the last game of the season and it was a freak theres no getting away from that
6779969 we started the game well and ended up down to 10 men within eight minutes and subsequently two goals down within 10 minutes
6779970 its not about who youve played before or where youve played them thats got nothing to do with it
6779971 its done and dusted it was last season were concentrating on this season and that involves now getting the league campaign up and running its a difficult venue but one were capable of going to and getting points
6779972 having been disappointed with our two league results its important we pick up start getting the points and start moving up
6779973 going and playing to the level we know we can will be the focus
6779974 its important we bring that to the game and still keep believing when were passing and moving the ball
6779975 even when you look back on last saturdays game and ive watched it numerous times now the opportunities we created were there for everybody to see but theres no getting away from the fact that we need to stop conceding really naive goals
6779976 hes ok but i still want to see how the candidates are going to improve the economy and offer something that i can believe will actually happen and im not sure what that is
6779977 there are many people in many parts of the country that arent ready for a black man in the white house
6779978 a lot of these senior citizens felt it was the last shot in their lifetime to have a woman president
6779979 great thats fine i know i can trust the gas man as they used to be called to be honest with me and get the old one working properly if humanly possible
6779980 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6779981 snoring is more than just a nuisance and can be a sign of a respiratory condition called sleep apnoea which affects more than 110 000 people in the uk and is caused by the narrowing of the throat during sleep
6779982 i have a lot of problems with the way this loan was written
6779983 we havent been able to take people off the waiting list because the people already getting services wanted additional services
6779984 no incentives for someone to say you know what i dont need speech therapy five days a week
6779985 i like to go on saturdays for lunch to mcdonalds and cicis pizza
6779986 these tiers were imposed on apd by the legislature which was frustrated with the lack of control
6779987 it was because of their inability to manage their budget and have a vision for cost efficient services
6779988 we have a moral and ethical obligation to these folks
6779989 whether it means going to get community support we will make it happen
6779990 pose an immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of patients
6779991 kept together in the hallways to sleep and are brought in the dining room for staffing convenience
6779992 i was saddened embarrassed and concerned reading the surveyors observations about our psychiatric unit
6779993 every issue raised by the surveyors is being addressed a plan of corrective actions and documentation will be delivered to cms in a timely manner so that the plan can be studied and discussed and modified as needed
6779994 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6779995 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations
6779996 people of earth stop your bickering i am from harvard and im here to help
6779997 dont you conservatives understand democrats care about the little guy theyre on the side of the proletariat i mean workers and as obama has so eloquently put it if the workers would only stop clinging to their silly sky god and guns theyd understand that
6779998 im really looking forward to a taste of the ewood park atmosphere in my first major home game against hull city
6779999 we received fantastic support at everton last saturday the big rovers contingent did us proud before during and after the game
