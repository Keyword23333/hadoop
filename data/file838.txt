8380040 in this difficult housing environment real estate professionals and home sellers need to do all they can to differentiate their property
8380041 while perceived value is not the same as what someone ultimately pays for a property it sets the benchmark as to what this property is worth in a buyers mind compared to other homes in the same neighborhood first impressions often have a big impact on a buyers decision making process on which homes to visit and how much to offer
8380042 professional photographs and videos are just as essential as a yard sign
8380043 the small investment made by my real estate agent was absolutely worth it and really set my home apart from other properties in the area
8380044 more than 84 percent of prospective home buyers start their search on the internet so the use of video to market a property is essential
8380045 videos are free to create on propertypreviews com so the return on investment is significant and home sellers should be demanding it

8380049 im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8380050 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8380051 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8380052 they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8380053 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8380054 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want
8380055 if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8380056 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8380057 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes
8380058 everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove he deserves to play
8380059 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8380060 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8380061 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8380062 every game is a big game but thursday is a big chance for us to showcase nationally what we certainly hope to be about as a football program
8380063 the biggest challenge without a doubt is i feel like when people havent had a lot of success a lot of times theyre scared of success we cant be a university thats scared of success
8380064 i like to walk down paths nobody else wants to
8380065 people are just throwing names and number out there before anything has happened
8380066 before you even play a down of football you feel like you should be handed a trophy
8380067 i think being on both ends of the spectrum has really helped us stay grounded we know that we cant let that stuff get to us
8380068 with the expectations through the roof for this football team i think theres a little bit of pressure
8380069 i hope we handle it better than we did last year
8380070 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8380071 it rained every day but i got the job done now i feel very confident in trying to win this event
8380072 my goal is to win and try to forget about everything else and what it all means
8380073 i come to every grand slam but here you feel special like ive made it here
8380074 i really can do it and ive done it here i dont know how to explain it i just play much more confident
8380075 i dont think you should be coming into a grand slam playing the first matches the best you got
8380076 i want to grow every day playing better and better i played better than my first match so its looking good definitely im not in my best shape right now
8380077 when i was in a danger situation i just realized i had to go to the forehand
8380078 i started to play better and move her around a little bit more and the second set i just started to be so much more confident in my game
8380079 i remember 2005 and it makes me go harder and harder
8380080 if i remember good things it keeps me even more positive and gives me more anger to play now i have much more experience and even at my worst i can win matches if i stay tough
8380081 i would look at different marketing please in this market you work every deal till you can

8380084 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
8380085 the president has argued that confronting iraq would not detract from the unfinished war against terrorism i believe he is right we should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time
8380086 i think its not only time not to take force off the table i think its time to put force on the table and use it
8380087 with the way things are commencing supplies from next month and an october launch looks unlikely
8380088 given the tough stand taken by mamata banerjee trinamool congress leader we dont see the deadlock breaking
8380089 we would initiate that as and when the situation is conducive we would go with the company tata motors and do as desired by them

8380093 its a testing time for both tata motors and the west bengal government irrespective of whether plan a or b works the project is going to be delayed and all the stakeholders in the project will suffer as a result

8380209 despu s de la creaci n del sistema de naciones unidas y de las instituciones de bretton woods fmi y banco mundial el n mero de estados se ha multiplicado por cuatro y el de las organizaciones internacionales se ha multiplicado por diez
8380210 no s lo es cada vez m s dif cil encontrar un compromiso global aceptable para todos
8380211 nadie absolutamente nadie se preocupa por saber si lo que debe elegirse en la omc sobre la agricultura por ejemplo permitir responder a los diagn sticos alarmantes de la organizaci n de la onu para la agricultura y la alimentaci n fao
8380212 la omc pide que se reduzca la producci n agr cola
8380213 la fao se re ne de urgencia para decir que hace falta aumentar la producci n agr cola en el mundo
8380214 hablar de la seguridad del mundo sin un miembro permanente del continente africano otro de am rica del sur y sin india en el consejo de seguridad
8380215 solo veo al g 14 como futuro lugar de arbitraje
8380216 la ue puede ser una referencia y un actor mayor
8380217 la era de las potencias relativas en la que nos encontramos puede desencadenar en una cooperaci n a n m s s lida
8380218 una poca marcada por las insuficiencias de un sistema mundial multilateral fragmentado
8380219 somos potencias relativas y hemos aprendido el compromiso y la cooperaci n
8380220 es el partido m s importante desde que soy entrenador del atl tico
8380221 enhance its product leadership in the fire retardant barrier category
8380222 this purchase is consistent with millikens intent to grow in the nonwovens arena and will serve to expand market and customer access
8380223 in the queens speech this autumn gordon browns government will announce a scheme to institute a database of every telephone call email and act of online usage by every resident of the uk
8380224 this fact should be in equal parts incredible and nauseating
8380225 salariatii muncesc foarte mult pentru realizarea acelor obiective dinainte stabilite fiecare cum a stiut mai bine unii si au perfectionat studiile altii si le au completat asta in conditiile unui program de lucru incarcat cu familii de intretinut cu copii la scoala cu cazuri aparte de probleme de sanatate cu ignorarea problemelor de sanatate
8380226 well strike their hideouts we wont show any kind of relaxation
8380227 all these years since his marriage with ms bhutto in 1987 i have known zardari on no occasion did i find him absent minded or forgetful as reported
8380228 but that does not mean he had not been stressed or suffered from it for that he did seek some medical help
8380229 well ive been running a lot and im close to my goal so this one treat wont hurt me
8380230 what was up with that last post you need to apologize for boring your audience half to death youre better than that
8380231 una pel cula de zombis de serie z que se toma en serio a s misma sin renunciar a ser una serie z una pel cula de miedo hecha por gente a la que le gustan las pelis de miedo para gente al a que le gustan las pelis de miedo

8380234 blitzing work sites in steubenville and clarington during the day on thursday in the run up to senator obamas acceptance speech at the democratic national convention
8380235 i am not running for senate i am not running for senate
8380236 thats not our business its not our business to build a cpu we are a visual computing company and i think the reason we have survived the other 35 companies who were making graphics at the start is that we have stayed focused
8380237 are we likely to build a cpu and take out intel i dont think so given their thirty year head start and billions and billions of dollars invested in it i think staying focused is our best strategy
8380238 on the other hand some action sequences are shot and edited in a way thats impossible to fully follow but everything is underscored with a fascinating subtext that blurs heroism with terrorism and bravery with torture
8380239 bale is grimly humourless as the tortured superhero suave as wayne savage in his costume the gruff voice he assumes as batman is an irritation
8380240 other reservations shouldnt nolan marvellous as his directing here is be creating original films rather than rebooting and retooling franchise fare why cant hollywood put a tenth as much of the craft and vim into its average releases as it does into what is ultimately only a superhero movie
8380241 this big bang finish which includes a topsy turvy image that poignantly suggests the world has been turned on its axis for good is sloppy at times visually incoherent yet touching mr nolan you learn likes to linger in the dark but he doesnt want to live there
8380242 much more serious in intent and message than 2005s batman begins dark knight would be fatally ponderous without ledgers nasty little sprite as it is the movie strains at its own wagnerian seams
8380243 at one point nolan finds himself cutting frenziedly between batman gordon the joker dent rachel and a crazy man in the police cooler and you feel the films sense slipping away between the smoking edits
8380244 barack obama es mi candidato y debe ser nuestro presidente

8380252 the improved high speed rail measure that will now go before voters is a solid product that if approved will help usher in a new era of transportation travel that is sorely needed in a state as large and diverse as california
8380253 three times our organization had the chance to launch a petition drive to put a water bond initiative on the ballot
8380254 and three times we decided not to pull the trigger out of respect for the legislative process and because we were hopeful we could reach broad agreement from all stakeholders on a water bond
8380255 the governor believes californians ought to have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
8380256 i knew i could get the same result as last year and i set off this time with the same intention
8380257 its a real feat for a spaniard to win the tour of benelux we arent used to these windswept races

8380259 the information held by the foreign secretary is not merely necessary but essential if binyam mohamed is to have his case fairly considered
8380260 we talk to our staff and clients about respect and integrity and we cant afford to have anything tarnish that
8380261 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound
8380262 the night was terrifying and difficult i thank the libyan authorities for their efforts which allowed us to be freed
8380263 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8380264 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8380265 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8380266 it would be a mistake to write off yellowstone as a dead volcano a hot plume even a slightly cooler one is still hot
8380267 gebt mir wenigstens ein bisschen geld und dann gehe ich
8380268 ich wollte euch nicht schockieren es war eine dumme aktion von mir
8380269 zu viel ger mpel aus dem baumarkt jeder wirt steckt hier seinen claim ab
8380270 the reason has to be because we have to repeat everything to men august 27 2008 9 14 am by god
8380271 you may visit this store only once there are 6 floors and the value of the products increase as you ascend the flights you may choose any item from a particular floor or may choose to go up to the next floor but you cannot go back down except to exit the building
8380272 but one condition if you so much as lay a finger on my daughter i will inflict upon you the three worst chinese tortures known to man
8380273 if thats the best the old man can do then i dont have much to worry about

8380275 lo que se viene es un trabajo muy fuerte muy dif cil que es el trabajo de rehabilitaci n f sica l tiene una severa par lisis del lado izquierdo de su cuerpo del brazo y de la pierna no podemos anticipar pero nosotros deseamos creemos que al menos un 50 60 por ciento de esta funci n se recupere pero no va a ser ni ma ana ni pasado va a ser despu s de varios meses de terapia f sica
8380276 la fortaleza f sica de carlos ha sido indispensable para poder llegar a este punto en el cual hemos considerado que la parte m s aguda y m s grave la hemos pasado
8380277 su vida como la ten a antes ser a una exigencia muy elevada me encantar a creo que su vida a partir de este evento resulta muy dif cil que sea la misma que antes esto es f cil de entender ya que tiene una gran infarto si hay un factor que nos va a poder ayudar es este que usted refiere es un joven atleta con una mentalidad de triunfador entrenado para hacer ejercicio

8380279 yo no s cu ntos golpes se pueda llevar un futbolista y m s un defensa central en un partido de futbol cuando menos unos 20 cabezazos da cuando menos unas 40 veces voltea bruscamente el cuello cuando menos 10 veces se lleva alg n recuerdito como ustedes dicen

8380281 siempre fui una especie de google para mi familia siempre tuve esta habilidad para recordar cosas
8380282 we believe the capital markets ultimately will insist on ifrs for public companies
8380283 todays action by the sec continues a robust and thoughtful debate that is critical as the transition occurs
8380284 this could be a major storm we anticipate it being in the southern gulf in the next few days we have to take it seriously
8380285 if it hits the city anywhere near how katrina hit no ones going to come back
8380286 my beautician told me she already booked an extra hotel room someplace up north called branton and we could stay there
8380287 everybody should be looking at their plans just like were looking at our plans and get ready
8380288 if they dont have a plan you still have time if you wait until the storms on top of you thats when panics going to set in and you dont think wisely
8380289 they should fuel their vehicles in anticipation of any future evacuation they should today make sure theyve got enough food and water on hand for a three day period
8380290 regardless of gustavs predicted path it is important for citizens in the gulf coast region to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8380291 if residents make individual and family preparations they make it easier for first responders to focus on people who cant help themselves and need help first
8380292 the state its local and federal partners are better prepared than weve ever been before for a major storm
8380293 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8380294 i have faith in the parts of the levees that were rebuilt
8380295 whoever is spared personal pain must feel himself called to help in diminishing the pain of others we must all carry our share of the misery which lies upon the world
8380296 if you find a job you really love you will never really do a days work your whole life
8380297 a gift that functions easily when its working the person who is filled with the holy spirit is able to do extraordinary things but to him it seems quite natural there is an ease to it
8380298 there is pressure from people just looking to pay their bills later
8380299 longer terms are being given to make sales obviously thats a dangerous situation when you have the credit crisis
8380300 designed for many of the best fashion brands of italy
8380301 in one of the major fashion capitals of the world
8380302 i am a rl fashion designer for more than 20 years and live in the one of the worlds major fashion capitals i need not to copy anyone
8380303 designed for many of the best fashion brands of italy
8380304 the style elements that bianca foulon has tried to work into the footwear are unique no matter where the inspiration lies

8380306 we want to do what we can to make sure that race is on the national radar and that it shines as bright as we can make it shine
8380307 im very comfortable that by getting people at a national level to pay attention to this race when it tightens down in the end well be able to get some support nationwide that will really help us
8380308 a further check of the driver and vehicle disclosed 1 2 ounces of crack cocaine and 1 400 in cash
8380309 looking back at the custom bike world it was such a contrast it was almost nauseating so experiencing the performance world made me want to build a bike that could balance both worlds
8380310 about two years ago i planned this machine and built it to do things its like late 50s early 60s sort of caf racer crossed with modern custom sports bike but with modern techno harley and a lot of high tech thrown in this simple little sketch that i made on an airplane it was a bike that had a look to it it was also a look that no one had really delved into before
8380311 it runs just a front cylinder and where the cylinder of the v sits i run the supercharger harleys themselves are fun to work with but to take half of one was even a bigger challenge theres something fun in making a machine go fast that really is not supposed to i figured it would either be a grenade or wed get it to work quite well
8380312 we barely start with any factory parts at all its building a bike from a clean sheet of paper on this motorcycle everything from the kickstand to the frame all the body is all hand made the wheels are specially made the hubs for instance i started with 96 pounds of aluminum material and manually machined it down to an 18 pound hub i mean youre building everything
8380313 the industry has had a lot of negative exposure most notably the show orange county not to slam them they do their thing and they have their place but they will never really be considered bike builders its entertainment its an alternative to watching temptation island its not about bike building its not about informing or educating or showing people how things are done its about silly drama thats a whole different thing and we dont like to be associated with that in any way
8380314 part of it is i didnt really push it because thats not how i roll i always sort of had this idea that this is my work and if you like it great if people pick up on it thats awesome and if not thats fine too i let my work speak for itself and thats worked for me im really not the self promotion kinda guy
8380315 im looking at buying a few and putting them in our cars i think it would be advantageous for our members as investigators
8380316 it will make not only the person being stopped but also our members more accountable for their actions
8380317 we actually have many very innovative ideas in kelowna and are leading edge in many ways that is somewhat pleasing because people are continually picking my brain about what were doing because word has spread that weve had some success especially in the downtown core
8380318 the fact is that a very small percentage of people are responsible for over 50 of the crime probably five per cent of the people account for committing 50 of the crime we have to find some legislation to deal with keeping prolific offenders behind bars
8380319 were all struggling trying to find members to become police officers its getting to a critical stage that people dont want to join police organizations anymore
8380320 the election office is now up an running out of the city clerks division and were here to answer any questions potential candidates or electors may have
8380321 during the next two years the province will continue to work with local elected officials and first nations to ensure any new information about the potential impact sales may have on water quality and the ability to expand the reservoirs is reviewed
8380322 i would have preferred they said it was over and done with but theyve agreed to back off now we all have a chance to say no
8380323 the way it is today the impact on reservoir lakes is low theres no year round residency and we have to protect those watersheds so there was concern that the government would be reselling the lots and development would take place
8380324 its very good news weve always said that its not just a matter of water quality but also quantity we do need the storage studies and im certainly pleased to see that they are not making any moves until we get more information to them
8380325 taking part in something like is something ive wanted to do for a long time but i had to wait until i had the time to devote my full attention to it i decided this year was the best chance id get
8380326 i struggled with body image while in high school i really feel into the trap of wanting to be super skinny it weighs on you and it weighs on everyone at some point i know what its like to have a good day be dependant on getting a smile from the boy you like and if that doesnt happen having it turn things upside down
8380327 i want to tell them to not hold back on doing something just because they are afraid they might fail failing is not the worst thing that could happen i was very afraid to get on the stage and answer questions but i did it and im glad that i did even if i hadnt been crowned i still have the knowledge that i tried
8380328 after the process to be selected miss kelowna was over the road to miss canada was nine days long we were watched by the judges every step of the way because someones true personality comes out after spending more than a week travelling around in a small bus the judges had a hard task because any of us woman would have been a good choice
8380329 unfortunately my family wasnt able to travel to ontario to watch the final selection actually a lot of us didnt have any family there to witness the event because it was just too expensive for them to travel so we cheered each other on when i made the top three the other girls prayed for me because they knew that was really important to me
8380330 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence
8380331 this is unprecedented violence much more widespread than weve ever seen
8380332 the violence against the christian community in orissa state which broke out after the reprehensible assassination
8380333 so far a total of nine persons have been killed in various incidents
8380334 anybody who left their job will not be allowed to return
8380335 they have become irrelevant and cannot be trusted anymore as educators
8380336 whats happening is a joke we came to school and the teachers told us to go home
8380337 but the new hamas principal says if we dont go to school for a week well be expelled
8380338 my salary and future are tied to the side that pays me
8380339 at the same time i am afraid therell be hamas procedures taken against me
8380340 they will turn the schools into centres for their black propaganda
8380341 unfortunately theres a tone a direction to correct some of the curriculum you could say its like they have their own quiet curriculum
8380342 i believe it the probe will finish this year for sure
8380343 i dont know whats happening now for me i think its good im trying to think only of the tennis
8380344 i still play i dont want to quit tennis im still trying to play better and better hopefully i can find my game and my confidence
8380345 its tough to say about federer he was for so many years number one and won every grand slam this year was not so great for him
8380346 maybe hes tired you cannot be number one forever i hope that hes not so top fit maybe is level is like that of any other player
8380347 you never know what can happen at us open the top six or eight guys can now win it but i dont want to speak about my chances
8380348 the court has issued an order asking the six defendants to stop protesting in government house and the area around the order takes effect immediately
8380349 we have discussed this and it is necessary that we have to defy the order
8380350 we have to fight so that our mission will be complete we would like to ask the mercy from the court to let us do our mission to restore the nation
8380351 we have to talk the senior police will talk about what to do next
8380352 we are going to wait here and wait for them to come in and get us
8380353 they have broken the law and it could be a serious setback for them
8380354 the government has a lot of options they have time on their side
8380355 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8380356 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8380357 informed his chinese colleague about the situation in south ossetia and abkhazia
8380358 china is concerned about the latest development in south ossetia and abkhazia
8380359 the military forces which have not yet pulled back to the lines they held before the hostilities must move without delay
8380360 which aims to unilaterally change the borders of georgia is quite simply unacceptable
8380361 clear commitment from the eu that it will continue to stand by georgia and the same applies for our membership of nato
8380362 we found the abducted japanese man he had been shot several times
8380363 we started a massive search operation to rescue him but unfortunately the abductors killed him
8380364 police closed the circle on abductors that is why they left him there bleeding
8380365 on monday the rubber dinghy started taking water and it overturned with the immigrants drowned
8380366 they just kept holding on to the dinghy until last night they were spotted by the maltese fishing vessel
8380367 my appeal goes to the government to release these immigrants from the detention centre because of their health and traumatic conditions
8380368 notwithstanding that they know about previous tragedies these desperate people still try and make the journey to europe
8380369 if you choose to depart from your philosophy if you choose to be politically expedient then you need to explain it
8380370 there will be a vote and the liberal party will have to sit there with the greens and vote down energy privatisation
8380371 barry ofarrell has to explain today why the proposals that weve got other than issues to do with politics he has got to explain financially economically and in the public interest
8380372 let me make this absolutely clear this will not be revisited in a years time
8380373 the labor party has exhausted itself in doing the right thing by the public if it goes down today it is over
8380374 but the opposition will still have a policy of privatising electricity when it goes to the election in 2011 and we will make sure that the public knows that thats their policy
8380375 if you can use private funds to do what is required and you can regulate those to get the outcomes that you want then the public sector is better off spending money on hospitals and schools
8380376 im not a seat warmer i dont sit around because im unemployable to pick up a salary at the public expense
8380377 damit stellen wir sicher dass keine unmittelbare gefahr mehr vom geb ude ausgeht
8380378 in diesem jahr hat die seniorenwoche einen schwerpunkt bewegung sport gesundheit
8380379 die kalkulation h ngt aber von vielen faktoren ab wie gewinn bersch ssen oder notwendigen investitionen deshalb ist die prognose nicht leicht
8380380 the timing of these motions raises serious questions as to the real motivation of these claims and we remain disappointed that nuance is resorting to these tactics to acquire zi without recognizing its full value
8380381 moving applications data and infrastructure in the cloud can actually make disaster recovery easier and much more affordable
8380382 classic disruptive innovation where the mainstream dismisses the product and small companies have time to create a real differentiated value
8380383 bethesda clearly has a solid understanding of the appeal behind the franchise and has taken great steps towards recreating and even improving upon the most important aspects of the classic pc role playing games
8380384 i stood up and said im a democrat but im not a person of faith i said this looks like a church service to me and i never thought i would see the democrats doing something like this

8380418 we didnt know what we were doing in the first half
8380419 we went back to our fast break game in the second half thats why we were able to take the lead
8380420 judging from our preseason form i expected us to be in this position we are ready to take advantage but we want to take it one game at a time

8380426 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

8380432 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8380433 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8380434 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8380435 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8380436 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8380437 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8380438 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8380439 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8380440 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8380441 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8380442 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

8380446 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8380447 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8380448 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

8380451 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8380452 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8380453 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

8380455 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

8380457 the build up of nato forces in the black sea area

8380673 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is way of finding that out

8380952 the late levy mwanawasa zambian president who died on august 19 led the way in opening up discussion on governance issues on zimbabwe africa union has for over 45 years been shy to allow contrarian views under the pretext of non interference in internal affairs of member states african heads of state ought to emulate mwanawasa by openly criticizing each other as a way of evaluation rather than pretend to speak in one voice as their economies sink the fact that botswanas president seretse ian khama and kenyas prime minister raila odinga have followed suit heralds the dawn of a new era in africa despite being chilubas chosen successor and within months of taking office in 2002 mwanawasa displeasure of graft saw him strip the former president of his immunity from prosecution for corruption african leaders should stop riding on the footsteps of their predecessors even when they engage in activities that threaten their national interests can african leaders muster courage and conviction as the late mwanawasa to better the continent may he rest in peace
8380953 we dont have a system here the government does not have a solution
8380954 if we did not have foreigners here i dont think the afghan national army or police would come out of their bases
8380955 if just 20 or 30 police had come round from the side they could have stopped them
8380956 its a very tough situation for people like me who helped the government
8380957 i receive calls and they ask are you still alive
8380958 the government also warned him the taliban insurgents were plotting his assassination and yet he maintained that they are not powerful
8380959 i dont think so it is the government that is weak
8380960 the government has the facilities weapons and equipment but we dont have the shepherds
8380961 people already did not believe in the government so it doubled their disbelief in the government
8380962 we dont know exactly if the taliban is powerful we have heard that
8380963 but when we see this kind of attack it seems they are very powerful
8380964 i would suggest it wasnt as strong as it could have been
8380965 the canadians are here but things are getting worse and worse
8380966 the police will have to work hard for a while
8380967 you dont need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows
8380968 it reminds me of what we used to do as kids
8380969 wed lay there on the ground and look up in the sky at the clouds and we would make all kinds of imaginary things out of the clouds i think theyre making up what they hope would be true or would want to be true or at least want to lead people to believe is true so they could get them to back a democratic candidate
8380970 he opposed while in the illinois senate the born alive infant protection act which really is about infanticide
8380971 he did not want to protect babies who survived an abortion he did not want to provide basic medical care he wanted to kill them outside the womb allow them to die

8380973 at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material
8380974 when i get there in the studio i never ask any questions if i get a phone call to go and play i enjoy every moment of it
8380975 whatever it ends up as to ever get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me its my life its what ive dreamed about doing
8380976 lots of politics would need to get ironed out before an album could be made
8380977 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade if he were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker
8380978 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8380979 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
8380980 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
8380981 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
8380982 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8380983 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8380984 it also says since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable looks like pelosi didnt study the subject long enough but not to worry we are sending her a copy of catholicism for dummies today
8380985 its the blind leading the blind in that party if the ardent practicing catholic doesnt care when life begins only that women have the choice to do what they choose sometimes thanks to people like pelosi not aware of what their choices actually are whether its life or not

8381089 as i know my people in afghanistan they will forgive the first time maybe they will forgive second time third time fourth time
8381090 but we should not expect that all the time they will forgive maybe some day theyll be angry and theyll react

8381161 babies sleep safest with mommies who wake up to their needs
8381162 whats often overlooked is that in countries where co sleeping is routinely practiced families almost never sleep in beds with soft mattresses and bulky covers a baby may be less likely to smother when the family sleeps on a floor mat with only a light coverlet
8381163 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8381164 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8381165 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8381166 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8381167 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8381168 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8381169 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8381170 when i saw them on the news i couldnt really see them

8381173 whether or not you can see that in the photograph is another matter
8381174 out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
8381175 whether people are in favor of this war or any war or against it we all know that people get killed and that war puts people in harms way
8381176 viewing these portraits of soldiers causes one to pause and think of the many sacrifices and efforts these men and women have experienced to protect us and defend this great country the portraits are a stark reminder of the reality of it all
8381177 for me looking at their faces serves also as a reminder to remember our service men and women and to thank them for all they do and have done i am disappointed that the billboards have been canceled and strongly hope the company will reconsider

8381181 the first mention of martins blog comes on page 52 of obama nation when it is cited as the source for corsis assertion that when obamas muslim stepfather registered him at a catholic school in indonesia obamas religion was recorded as
8381182 in fact martin is not the only one who reported the information on jan 25 2007 the same day that martin posted it on his blog the associated press reported the same information from the fransiskus assisi catholic school and ran a photograph of the document
8381183 although lolo soetero obamas stepfather was nominally a muslim obama then known as barry soetoro studied catholic catechism at the school
8381184 what was martins source for his repeated insistence that obamas former school requires students to dress in traditional muslim attire on fridays
8381185 ive lived in southeast asia for 20 years i go to schools all the time
8381186 in a 2007 post martin also claims that the indonesian title of obamas book the audacity of hope menerjang harapan means

8381205 the governor is bound by the states laws including the labor relations laws
8381206 i dont think i could have said it more clearly
8381207 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8381208 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8381209 its astounding that governor douglas is fighting to keep his million dollar pr operation while sacrificing services vital to vermonters
8381210 he would rather promote himself and his administration than fund the affordable housing college scholarships job training and other critical programs vermonters need
8381211 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea
8381212 the supreme court has carefully looked at its options under the constitution and statutes that would be able to perform the restructuring necessary to downsize the judiciary and determined that we would have to operate fewer court facilities to meet the target amount
8381213 we dont have any illusions in the judicial branch about the somewhat pessimistic economic news that were facing
8381214 the court system knows that it needs to participate with everyone else in government and with all vermonters in identifying ways to make it through this tough time
8381215 one of those things that i keep telling my colleagues if they fully funded amtrak i would not be late
8381216 its a tremendous loss for the college but beyond that we just dont have a lot of information
8381217 does this look like something the taliban would wear can you believe it this is what afghanistan has become
8381218 while women and children are killed it means there have not been very accurate measurements for the operations

8381257 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8381258 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8381259 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8381260 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8381261 he doesnt like being at the mercy of others he likes to be in control of what hes doing
8381262 i suspect that theres some pretty strong or in depth party polls that are riding by riding that are persuading him that his chances are pretty good right now
8381263 it gives me great pleasure to announce ms poptart lilliehook as chief editor of the modavia fashion directory poptart will oversee the monthly development of the directory as well as manage and coordinate directory staff models designers and photographers pop is not only a well respected working model but also a seasoned businesswoman whom i regard highly she has a critical eye and is never pleased when something is left undone or done without excellence she is unafraid of challenge works endless hours and is willing to do whatever it takes to reach the goal i am certain the modavia fashion directory will grow in even greater quality and prominence under pops leadership
8381264 because britney shaved her hair off even now the hair would be too short for extensions so they are covering her hair like a wig rather than blending into her own hair the golden rule with hair extensions is that they should only ever be double the length of the actual hair to keep them looking natural and easy to maintain to make matters worse britney has put her hair up and the hairdresser hasnt left any hair at the hairline to conceal the bonds overall its a disaster
8381265 the reason that victorias extensions look so bad here is the cheap looking scarf she is using to disguise them hair attached to a cap or scarf of any kind instantly looks like it is trying to conceal joins glue and other signs that the hair is in fact extensions the hair is too long and the extreme colour contrast doesnt look remotely natural the only positive thing we can say about this look is that i dont think posh was going for a natural look here she was creating a character
8381266 i would love to get my hands on courtneys hair she has too much hair in each bond and theres no consideration for weight balance less is best in most cases the root lift in the top section shows incorrect application of the hair extensions and its clear that the bonds have been applied too close to her scalp
8381267 there is so much wrong with nicoles extensions here that it almost looks deliberate aside from them looking extremely synthetic and sparse the colour is the most obvious problem since the different shades dont blend well together and clash with her natural hue this trashy finish can be avoided by using high quality human hair extensions for a more natural texture and colour and also by ensuring that the colours are as close to the clients base shade as possible to achieve a professional finish opt for pre mixed hair for subtle lowlights rather than streaks cut the clients hair in to a manageable shapely style and ensure that the thickness remains balanced all over
8381268 i like caprices style she really knows how to put her outfits together however when it comes to her hair it can really let her down while i dont think the colour is too badly matched this hair is unflattering and artificial in the way it falls to avoid the fake look stylists should always use 100 human hair extensions as these will remain glamorous and sexy aftercare is also an essential part of immaculate extensions and my advice is to only use oil free shampoo and conditioners
8381269 victorias hair extensions are too close to her parting hair extensions should never be attached so close to the parting or to the roots as it pulls the hair making them visible if extensions are applied close to a parting the best method is to use small flat bonds that blend effortlessly

8381369 ich m chte mich bei valencia f r seine anstrengungen und f r alles was der klub mir erm glicht hat bedanken ich hoffe ich kann mein level halten oder mich sogar noch verbessern
8381370 was ein perfekter abschluss w re den fa cup den carling cup die meisterschaft und die champions league zu gewinnen zumindest zwei dieser titel w rde ich gerne holen das wichtigste ist aber fit zu bleiben weiter auf einem hohen niveau spielen zu k nnen und wichtig f r den klub zu sein dann m sste es am ende f r den einen oder anderen pokal reichen
8381371 nat rlich ist es eine gro e herausforderung aber vor einem m glichen halbfinale bereitet uns der gedanke daran keine schlaflosen n chte die hauptsache ist die konzentration auf das erste spiel dann kommen die wochen mit champions league am mittwoch und der liga am samstag wir haben so viele spiele in einem jahr dass du dich gar nicht nur auf eine sache konzentrieren kannst bei uns spielen aber eine menge professioneller akteure die diese partien alle gewinnen wollen besonders die wichtigen spiele das wichtigste ist titel zu gewinnen und dabei so viel spa wie m glich zu haben
8381372 das halbfinale der fifa weltmeisterschaft 1998 gegen brasilien damals herrschte eine sehr gute stimmung im team und gegen brasilien in einem halbfinale zu spielen ist einfach gro artig das ganze stadion war orange und gelb das sind einfach sch ne farben das wetter passte die ganze welt schaute zu ich habe alles f r das nationalteam gegeben nun kann ich mich voll auf united konzentrieren ich hoffe dass diese entscheidung meiner fitness zu gute kommt

8381382 ideally id like everybody here in oakland all the time but thats not realistic i think one thing monta has done each and every year is improve and i do believe most improvement is made during the summer thats when guys do get better so i cant debate that
8381383 its the food that we like to go out to eat
8381384 and thats before they know about his position on choice and that hes against equal pay

8381398 mr layton has an interest in finding out more about the campaign its had quite a lot of attention here in canada and we do share a lot of the same values and messaging of hope for working families here in canada naftagate happened we wrote to senator obama and senator clinton calling on them to stand together with us in order to favour reopening of nafta thats the kind of dialogue that we hope to keep going with the democrats
8381399 in just ten days your teeth can be ivory white
8381400 i thought there was a lot of truth to the character and i thought hes different enough from what i had done in the past although it seems to be most of the stuff ive been doing is either a cop or a robber but if that pays the bills that s okay
8381401 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8381402 im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8381403 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8381404 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8381405 they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8381406 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8381407 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want
8381408 if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8381409 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother

8381413 the real question in 2008 is whether the republicans will be able to do it again
8381414 translating darwishs poetry was a dream of beauty of art with the glimmer that art will lead to cultural and mutual respect among peoples and in making the translations i focused as much on the strange in the poems as on the familiar and the universal
8381415 to savour the solid and carefully crafted building blocks of darwishs bold and delicate imagery and the echoes of his sound patterns
8381416 darwish has long been an eloquent voice for palestinian identity aspirations and rights but his poetry is never reducible to politics and this volume above all communicates darwishs mighty artistic presence at this utterly mature period of his poetic career

8381442 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8381443 i dont have any idea what its going to be
8381444 im not really too familiar with it yet what the advantage is going to be with digital except its a lot better picture but what i worry about is the cost of it for older people
8381445 the new uk center is both a strong commitment to providing the best facilities to our employees and an underlining of our determination to continuously deliver unsurpassed images of the subsurface to our clients
8381446 a situa o dele ainda est no ar estas coisas levam tempo especialmente quando ele est livre n o duvido dele mas tenho d vidas quanto ao acerto
8381447 i dont care how many times people tell me this issue is no longer important that voters dont care about it anymore its still out there
8381448 you know its interesting the california decision as well as the massachusetts decision i dont think should ever have been implemented by the governors schwarzenegger and romney
8381449 they were both decisions that the governors simply could have said the court has said that we have to do it but let them enforce it because those were administrative decisions that had to put that in place and there was no mandate
8381450 well you know ive not probably been an advocate for him in that position and you know i am going to let him defend himself and i dont want to relive the primary but i think that that was a very unfortunate position that he took in saying that well i cant do anything about it oh yes you can
8381451 he could have stopped it and should have stopped it
8381452 liberal special interest groups worked hand in hand with the liberal members of the judiciary committee to sink bork and biden was in charge of it all
8381453 its important to remember that sen biden was the chairman of the committee during the bork nomination and the thomas confirmation fights
8381454 he very much planned the hearings organized them orchestrated them and caused them to take the form that they did i think it is fair to say that he was the grand inquisitor in the inquisition he was the person really orchestrating the whole show
8381455 hes been a pretty adamant filibusterer and has been very much a party to the filibustering of judicial nominees
8381456 i think that filibustering and failing to give people an up or down vote has been very much a continuation of what started with the bork hearings and the thomas hearings
8381457 if you slow this down frame by frame you can see the cop push him over
8381458 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process
8381459 they could then secede from the united states and then we might have another civil war
8381460 they have an allegiance to mexico where they were taught the u s fought an unjust war with mexico and took this territory
8381461 they believe the territory of these states belongs to mexico
8381462 while it is an interesting choice senator obama didnt get it right
8381463 i dont see how picking a vp candidate who has been in the senate 14 years longer than john mccain strengthens the obama campaigns message of change
8381464 senator biden does shore up the ticket as far as foreign policy experience is concerned but given the vast difference in experience it actually makes senator obama look smaller in comparison
8381465 in the democratic primary debates and the recent saddleback forum senator obama has shown that when he is off the teleprompter he is not a particularly good speaker people who are following the campaign recognize why senator obama has refused to appear in town hall settings with john mccain
8381466 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

8381470 nazis since they called their movement national socialism were socialists
8381471 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8381472 we are closer to world war iii than to november elections
8381473 george soros and other british controlled forces are driving the united states to the brink of war they have pushed the world to the edge of what could be thermonuclear war
8381474 it is the political essence of the situation we are on the verge of a tet offensive on all fronts and it will lead to a general breakdown just like what occurred with the first tet offensive that type of an offensive cannot be sustained and it will lead to a catastrophe for those who do it just like it did for general william westmoreland 40 years ago
8381475 theres no other way of putting it this attack is sick
8381476 hackers have no qualms about exploiting a familys natural instinct to defend its most vulnerable members hopefully people will pause before opening the attachment but the reflex action of some may be to click first and think later
8381477 free skwerl blogger arrested for posting guns n roses chinese democracy songs
8381478 there is just no way that you can avoid anticipating what is going to come everyone is aware that mccain is different on these issues
8381479 were all kind of waiting with anticipation because we just dont know how hes going to thread this needle
8381480 im sure it will have some impact yes but indian americans are not a large percentage so its not going to be that much
8381481 for me there is a lot of commonality in terms of that hes also well educated and professional and about giving the opportunity to ideas and changing the idea of america
8381482 for the franchise to turn the corner we think management needs to announce a significant bulk asset sale or framework for investors to evaluate the structure pricing of likely asset disposals and incremental capital should it be needed
8381483 the seller ended this listing early because the item was lost or broken

8381487 as election day approaches we as christians know we need to be committed to praying for the outcome and for those who will be elected to lead us
8381488 but milestone moments like this in our history should remind us of the importance of asking god for spiritual awakening in our land
8381489 as christians we need god to give us wisdom as we select the next president of the united states
8381490 people must realize that government at every level is a lagging social indicator
8381491 true and lasting change in our nation will come from spiritual renewal in the hearts of americas citizens not from government programs
8381492 help churches find ways to help christians get to the polls

8381496 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8381497 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8381498 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8381499 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8381500 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8381501 you have been convicted of what can only be described as a nasty assault
8381502 you have a record for a woman of your age which is to say the least concerning
8381503 he had everything to live for maybe if the jury had known her previous convictions it might have been different
8381504 even without the altercation he still might have collapsed and died
8381505 were not set up to go out and do the great big fight in one night it takes us several nights to go out and catch up
8381506 i live on the bay side and i cant even sit on my deck
8381507 i cant walk out to the bird feeder without having my legs completely covered with them
8381508 i was talking to my sister districts and theyre all scrambling too trying to catch up with these things hopefully by the weekend it will be better i wont say theyll be gone but hopefully theyll be better
8381509 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8381510 i ran for president to renew the promise of america to rebuild the middle class and sustain the american dream to provide the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded to save for college a home and retirement to afford the gas and groceries and still have a little left over each month those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8381511 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8381512 hillary clinton is the strongest candidate for the party and the nation
8381513 what you want obama baby i got it what you need obama you know i got it hooo all im asking obama is for a little respect just a little bit r e s p e c t finds out what it means to me
8381514 means mccain would run a campaign without a core constituency of the republican party
8381515 i think there would be a walkout on lieberman at the convention hes not a republican
8381516 heck im going to lose my virginity it might as well be to tom jones
8381517 dont go after you own memories and the external meaning
8381518 you do want to find out some things about guys
8381519 there are always guys who show up on this last game and youre hoping they can do some things for you you see it in a game and that solidifies your decision making thats what were looking for
8381520 its not a time of year where you just want to relax and say one more
8381521 you definitely want to sprint to the finish line for us its important to get a good week of practice and practice on some things and get another good week of practice and keep building on what weve done this offseason
8381522 i can give you the list of the guys who will play and it will probably be shorter
8381523 were going to keep most of our first group out
8381524 you have things you think you know how theyre going to go
8381525 you have some spots you still want to see i told our guys for the most part when you get to those last eight or nine spots on the roster there are a number of guys who can fill that role you want to see who can do a number of things thats what this game will be about
8381526 well have some young guys who will play more than theyve normally played
8381527 who can play multiple positions thats what youre looking to see in this last game
8381528 its kind of a two fold purpose week for us getting ready for the season opener and trying to formulate our roster and get down to the best 53 man team for us
8381529 i told our guys at our meeting tuesday morning that that was really the major focus of this game trying to figure out what group was going to give us the best opportunity to have a great team in the regular season
8381530 weve looked at a lot of things from otas offseason organized team activities on forward and we want to come out with the best team with that in mind were pushing forward
8381531 this is the master bedroom located in the northeast corner of the house
8381532 notice the king size bed which is dressed in an expensive down comforter by ralph lauren and topped with dozens of designer pillows
8381533 lived studied made friends and learned the abcs of life and took my first musical steps in moscow i cant help but feel torn
8381534 dont be pressured lets enjoy life and it will come in gods time
8381535 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8381536 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8381537 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8381538 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8381539 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8381540 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8381541 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative

8381544 the nights theme securing americas future suggests biden chairman of the senate foreign relations committee will flex his foreign policy muscle inside the convention hall around town this afternoon james carville will be the guest at a christian science monitor lunch where he may attempt to explain his remark monday that irked the obama campaign democrats carville said are playing hide the message pretty good at the convention
8381545 obama campaign did review hrc speech beforehand aides say live on katie courics convention webcast wwes the frightening and corrupt old man who has been a senator from alaska since before alaska was invented managed to win the republican primary even though he is currently under indictment for something dreadful involving home renovations stevens defeated six challengers so now he has a chance to lose to the mayor of anchorage in the general
8381546 i adore jon stewart a huge demographic of the country adores jon stewart and the reason that so many people adore jon stewart the decency honesty and intelligence he projects and though hes famously loathe to admit it i think he knows this and in that breakfast meeting at least he seemed to use that understanding as an opportunity to speak from a position of authority to the main authorities of journalism this to me seemed to be jon stewarts heartfelt beg to the information carriers to live up to their responsibilities and from my vantage point those in attendance seemed comfortable with the rooms dynamic they seemed eager to glean from stewart whatever the secrets to whatever magic it is that gives him the right to speak to them with such authority
8381547 almost 26 million watched 10pm hour hillary clinton speech of convention coverage
8381548 this is the first day of my life im glad i didnt die before i met you but now i dont care i could go anywhere with you and id probably be happy
8381549 i would love to support the person michelle obama has conjured for us this week successful working class girl who worked hard upheld traditional values and was rewarded by a great nation
8381550 one of the smallest and most understaffed departments in the university
8381551 designed specifically for the intellectual and social interests of blacks and other third world students
8381552 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
8381553 on behalf of my church home and my pastor reverend wright i bring greetings
8381554 obama begins with a broad assessment of life in america in 2008 and life is not good were a divided country were a country that is just downright mean we are guided by fear were a nation of cynics sloths and complacents
8381555 this trade has been building for quite some time i would call it the decoupling trade youve seen it in many different forms people thought it was decoupling by shorting the dollar or buying emerging market equities thats been happening for a very long time the fact that china is down 60 percent in my view that doesnt mean it cant go down more i think you are just starting to see this
8381556 it really comes down to the two big issues energy and the dollar and the credit markets those are the two fundamental injuries that we have seen in the economy over the last year and i think you have to see more evidence that its being taken care of on the energy side global growth is going slow because the big marginal buyer of commodities has been the emerging world if you have a slowdown in china its a big deal for global commodities
8381557 they have outperformed by a wide margin a part of that is because of a takeover premium thats being built into these stocks there is a very asymmetrical risk in terms of taxes next year there is no chance of capital gains taxes moving lower there is a significant chance of them moving higher you are seeing a lot of these iconic family businesses all selling now
8381558 but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restored and sorrows end
8381559 the biggest issue you have on the consumer side in particular is how much have we fully reflected the price increases let alone the turn in the cycle
8381560 the way to look at it is in cpi food next month there will be the ag price increases from five months before next month that will dominate any price decline from the prior month
8381561 those raw material inputs do not seem to affect cpi
8381562 as the months unfold if inflation stays sticky but commodities fall then the underlying trend of higher inflation is still a positive for commodities and they are just going through the ups and downs that markets go through
8381563 there will probably be a level were everyone decides this is the level of profitability we should be earning

8381565 people that are here that are supporting the democratic party need to understand that the end to the war is not going to come through these bourgeois politicians theyre going to come through you know a dedicated militant anti war movement in the streets
8381566 i was involved in interrogations which played a big part in shaping my consciousness of what we were doing there i would say 90 percent or more of the prisoners we had come through our detention facility had done absolutely nothing wrong they were just picked up in random raids they were just picked up for having a cell phone having a shovel something like that
8381567 were running to interject ourselves into the election and make people realize that there isnt any hope in voting every four years for who will oppress you the next four years

8381569 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8381570 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8381571 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8381572 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8381573 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8381574 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8381575 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8381576 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8381577 we can definitely provide services for the rest of latin america from chile
8381578 but the local market is not as attractive because prices are very similar

8381599 i make no bones about it thats my only hidden agenda
8381600 these are things im going to be running on they dont seem to be issues we might be focusing on in a local campaign but they are issues my campaign will be focusing on
8381601 the reason im running is really bring some issues here to light
8381602 particularly the conditions the latino community here in san juan capistrano face
8381603 one of the criticisms is that we dont take control of the community we live in but its hard to do that when youre afraid to step outside of your house
8381604 some current city council members seem to have a lack of vision and passion there have been some poor decisions made which have gone against the best interests of our community
8381605 if these types of decisions continue we will find ourselves with increased crime more traffic problems loss of our historical assets and possibly a dilapidated city
8381606 i am a fiscal conservative with a masters degree in taxation
8381607 so i know how to manage a bottom line i know these issues along with other important issues are achievable focus passion and sensible balance are key
8381608 i have the time and i like to give back to the community
8381609 i love san juan capistrano ive been following the issues and think maybe i can help out with some of the issues here
8381610 they went from horse trails to all sidewalks and things changed
8381611 and here in san juan capistrano people talk about the preservation of open space and slow growth i love it thats why people come here
8381612 you hear from both sides the people that are for the development and against the development then you weigh that with city staff recommendations and any other legal ramifications a project might have
8381613 this issue impacts public safety quality of life and the environment i am dedicated to preserving the rural and historic character of this city this is what makes san juan capistrano such a special place to live
8381614 if i am elected i will make the people my priority
8381615 i want to know their concerns and i will address their issues

8381627 eine solide arbeit mit einem zuverl ssigen auto wir sind viele runden gefahren damit nelson so viele kilometer wie m glich im low downforce trimm abspulen konnte es ist hier immer eine besondere herausforderung das auto abzustimmen da es eine so einmalige strecke ist aber wir haben eine menge daten gesammelt mit denen wir eine gute basis f r die weitere arbeit haben
8381628 in the winter of 1984 hal lowenstein productions produced a song and music video for rising star laurence butler rayne familiar with an early draft of the screenplay for the second indiana jones film lowenstein and rayne set out to create a hit theme song to be released with the upcoming summer movie after it was finished hlp pitched the music video and sent it off to lucasfilms just as temple of doom was wrapping principal photography they never heard back
8381629 like all brothers we called each other nicknames when we were kids loser and loser brain stuff like that and one day out of nowhere i called him l b rayne and he said what the hell does that mean and i said i have no idea but it sounds like a failed 80s singer so from there we started talking about this failed singer who did all these terrible songs in the 80s that never took off this was years ago weve been talking about this for a decade now
8381630 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8381631 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8381632 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8381633 they can say as much as they want my duty as a juror is to be fair and impartial but theyre human beings theyre not computers the absolute depravity of what occurred there has to have a biasing effect
8381634 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again
8381635 this defendant uses the time that he has to think out these plans and he is dangerous
8381636 we hope to attract a great number of customers who will be able to see the whole city and enjoy the restaurants and pools on ground below

8381638 nosotros no queremos otra guerra fr a y el presidente de rusia tiene la responsabilidad de no desatarla aunque diga que no la teme
8381639 la mayor coalici n posible contra la agresi n rusa en georgia
8381640 debemos revisar la naturaleza profundidad y amplitud de nuestras relaciones con rusia
8381641 desafiando a la comunidad mundial y amenazando a sus pa ses vecinos
8381642 europa necesita el gas ruso pero en igual medida rusia y su compa a gazprom necesitan a los consumidores y las inversiones europeas
8381643 una cooperaci n entre iguales y no unas relaciones de amo y criado
8381644 las puertas de la otan y la uni n europea deben estar abiertas para ucrania
8381645 amenaza la seguridad en todo el espacio de la antigua urss
8381646 ning n pa s es capaz de garantizar a solas su seguridad
8381647 amenaza la paz y la estabilidad en la regi n y en el espacio europeo mina el orden internacional existente viola los principios de la carta de la onu y supone un cambio ileg timo de las fronteras y una manifestaci n de presiones y de intervenci n con empleo de la fuerza
8381648 ucrania puede convertirse en el pr ximo blanco de las presiones pol ticas de rusia
8381649 suppose for example youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom would you vote this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8381650 for those of us interested in politics it was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november the purpose of the convention is introduce the candidate in a new and different and hopefully more positive way to unify the party and aid in defining the battle between democrats and republicans
8381651 hunter biden met with the obama senate office not with senator obama
8381652 its hardly surprising that a senator from illinois would fight for investments in mercy hospital thorek hospital and st xavier university right in illinois or that hed be joined in that effort by a republican colleague representative judy biggert
8381653 working with a number of clients institutions like yours and we would like to help you identify earmarks federal support and grants
8381654 to meet the demand in the southwest chicago metropolita area
8381655 two years ago we graduated more african american and hispanic nurses than any private college in the state of illinois
8381656 im not at all apologetic that we asked for federal support for huge health care needs of this growing community
8381657 he was a crucial supporter of the law in that he paved the way for other democrats to support it
8381658 senator biden provided a lot of political cover for the credit card industry because they wanted to show that the proposal had bipartisan support he aggressively undermined the opposition to the bill
8381659 hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
8381660 he was never a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
8381661 he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8381662 while barack obama decries washington insiders and says that he detests lobbyists joe biden is the model washington insider with numerous connections to lobbyists and special interests
8381663 there is great joy to be had in discovering just how clever this game is
8381664 everything about our daily lives that we consider meaningful is predicated on the difference between past and future
8381665 you think the past has happened the future hasnt happened therefore i have choices about what i can make happen therefore my life has meaning somehow
8381666 it doesnt feel immature the way other games feel immature because it doesnt short you in any respect
8381667 it expects as much from you as an audience member as any other fully adult media does
8381668 oof last time she said that about someone it ended one of mtvs greatest reality shows
8381669 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case

8381673 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8381674 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8381675 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
8381676 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
8381677 the summer has been full of talk about gareth barry and cristiano ronaldo but this transfer allows fans to have a say in whether it is right for the club
8381678 whereas transfers at other clubs are decided by a few board members this decision will be taken by 30 000 board members
8381679 it has become very apparent that members are taking the responsibility of ownership very seriously and considering decisions made so far

8381681 net impact has worked hard to establish this event as the premier conference of its kind and we are thrilled to be working with the wharton school to host the 2008 net impact north america conference
8381682 the speakers and sessions planned for this year s agenda promise to make this conference our largest to date and we look forward to engaging participants around these important issues of business sustainability
8381683 we are proud to host the 2008 net impact north america conference this fall at the wharton school there is a strong interest among our faculty and students in studying and engaging with questions related to the social impact and responsibilities of business the conference is a wonderful opportunity for us to assemble prominent thinkers in this field all at one time
8381684 we have put a new spin on typical hand me downs and added some fun to recycling by creating a network of women who can buy sell and trade
8381685 our goal is to make a collection of fabulously chic maternity clothing and kids items accessible and affordable for smart moms everywhere
8381686 smart moms everywhere have to find new ways to save money on the essentials but theres no reason why it cant be easy and fun

8381692 yougottabackthepack the o line and d line suck thats news to me how did we make it to the championship game last year with the same players as this year
8381693 do you guys think the packers not we have any chance of being 3 1
8381694 the fact is the o line does suck and that brett made the spread offense work remember we need the spread offense because our guys cant power block thus ar having to do the smeak lately
8381695 i hope that we or the packers for badgers brewers bucs and packers can start out 2 2 for the first four games i am not a tt fan i believe that he really screwed up with the whole farve fiasco if you dont want to hear about brett farve then you should become a vikings gophers wild timeberwolves fan because farve will always be mentioned when you talk about the packers kind of like jordan and the bulls so you get over it or move to mn or is that where you currently live
8381696 in tonights match up we having the sure shot little leprechauns against the backed up traffic of the heavily favored interchange

8381740 charter communications has been a tremendous partner and supporter of the worcester sharks since the day we announced the franchise
8381741 having them as the title sponsor of the 2009 ahl all star classic is another amazing example of how they support the communities they serve
8381742 charter communications is proud to support the american hockey league and the worcester sharks in bringing the 2009 ahl all star classic to worcester
8381743 with almost 50 percent of the ahl markets overlapping our new england and new york markets this is a great opportunity for both organizations to promote affordable family entertainment
8381744 does this look like something the taliban would wear can you believe it this is what afghanistan has become
8381745 while women and children are killed it means there have not been very accurate measurements for the operations
8381746 so its no surprise that when they are attacked they hit back hard they dont know if theres one or 100 insurgents firing at them
8381747 as i know my people in afghanistan they will forgive the first time maybe they will forgive second time third time fourth time
8381748 but we should not expect that all the time they will forgive maybe some day theyll be angry and theyll react
8381749 the more the americans oppress the people the greater the afghan desire for revenge
8381750 the americans may have created more than 1 000 new enemies in herat province

8381752 now those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires gal 5 24nasu
8381753 no one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to one and despise the other you cannot serve god and wealth matt 6 24nasu
8381754 for this reason referring to verse 24 above i say to you do not be worried about your life as to what you will eat or what you will drink nor for your body as to what you will put on is not life more than food and the body more than clothing
8381755 look at the birds of the air that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not worth much more than they
8381756 and who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life
8381757 and why are you worried about clothing observe how the lilies of the field grow they do not toil nor do they spin
8381758 but if god so clothes the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace will he not much more clothe you you of little faith
8381759 do not worry then saying what will we eat or what will we drink or what will we wear for clothing matt 6 25 31
8381760 for the gentiles eagerly seek all these things for your heavenly father knows that you need all these things
8381761 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you matt 6 25 33nasu
8381762 therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus 2 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death rom 8 1 2nasu
8381763 so then brethren we are under obligation not to the flesh to live according to the flesh 13 for if you are living according to the flesh you must die but if by the spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body you will live 14
8381764 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven
8381765 and the only right we have based on scripture is to be called the children of god based on our faith and gods grace alone john 1 12 but the responsibility of that right is lost in an unrepentant life and the unregenerate heart

8381771 the team will undergo strict training because we want to win the two matches against vanuatu and the remaining one against new zealand in november to better our ranking
8381772 vanuatu is a very physical team filled with some very skilful and talented players i am confident of our chance and will prepare the boys accordingly for the two matches
8381773 our squad comprises of some very young players that will be getting their big break on the national level and i see this as the best opportunity to utilize the talents of our youngsters and showcase them to the world
8381774 we have selected the best squad around and if players combine well then we will be a force to be reckoned with
8381775 a search of the address in derbyshire is under way and is expected to take several days
8381776 our county court is very interested in making sure that people who are addicted to drugs get treatment so they are no longer addicted to drugs i believe the county court judge is of the firm belief that putting somebody in jail without treating their addiction isnt going to resolve the problem so theres an effort to make sure that treatment is a part of what we do to address the situation
8381777 it takes a great deal of time and effort to put these drug investigations together and to arrest people were seeing the system failing us in many ways were seeing people that arent seeing the jail time that they need were seeing people on the streets far to quick you know in yesterdays situation there was three people who made bail before we had the paperwork done
8381778 were making progress when we target the street level dealer it allows us to move up the chain to the bigger dealers
8381779 st lawrence county had lowest felony drug conviction rate in north country
8381780 her last act of activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life
8381781 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8381782 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8381783 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8381784 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8381785 we would never have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis

8381792 despite a stated preference for a new system or some sort of new order nothing has really emerged
8381793 i do think there are some overarching sets of norms that are close to being universally accepted
8381794 theres got to be some balance between the new goals and the collective good which can minimize risk
8381795 there isnt a whole lot of new birth going on and there doesnt seem to be a major push by one point in the world to create these organizations
8381796 in truth most states are muddling by with what they have
8381797 you probably need a whole new cluster of organizations to address post cold war problems
8381798 you have to create not only a global architecture about how the world is going to be governed but also either through persuasion coercion or a variety of other inducements a way to get all the key players to agree to this kind of governance
8381799 you have to make an almost herculean effort to take all the resources you have domestically and spend them on external purposes
8381800 it means taking very precious resources and we have those resources but its a constant issue of priorities
8381801 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8381802 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8381803 the weakness in the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8381804 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good
8381805 i think what we see is a lot of confusion right now im not sure investors really know what to do youve got oil jumping all over the place
8381806 y ou have to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that existed before the web you have to throw them away because they cant make money for you anymore and that is all that matters we dont use price to earnings multiples anymore at his hedge fund if we talk about price to book we have already gone astray if we use any of what graham and dodd teach us we wouldnt have a dime under management
8381807 you should be buying things and accept that they are overvalued but accept that theyre going to keep going higher i know that sounds irresponsible but thats how you make the money right now up is down left is right peace is war
8381808 to jons great credit he has drawn the new generations into the political arena in a way they have not been for the last few election cycles and the country is better off for it
8381809 i think he feels he has a constituency of young people to whom he feels a responsibility and he is trying to present issues in a satirical way but in a robust and affirmative way
8381810 the class was basically like a bunch of guys sitting around on a saturday night having a beer and making funny wisecracks
8381811 to be a psychologist which he majored in at university and then switch to comedy you have to have that veneer of political awareness and he did have a passion to be funny
8381812 he made a little deal with me that i would give him two years to try and explore what he wanted to do
8381813 so he took all kinds of weird jobs just to keep himself afloat until that point he announced he wanted to go to new york to be in comedy
8381814 his humour is biting especially when you dont know what to expect this is a very smart serious fellow
8381815 its understandable its not going to happen over night we have to deal with it
8381816 its just impossible to walk its not safe to walk so im just trying to find an alternative route
8381817 we can deal with it hopefully it gets done kinda soon
8381818 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8381819 i knew there was a possibility so it wasnt a complete shock when i got called in and was told i would be scratched from the lineup due to precautionary reasons the club was in discussions for possibly moving me
8381820 if thats the case if im moved to a club that has postseason possibilities you cant be disappointed as a player
8381821 ive had a lot of fun here and ive been happy with bobby cox and the organization
8381822 larrabee hasnt shipped so you dont know what it is and i dont know what it is

8381825 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8381826 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
8381827 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go
8381828 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
8381829 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math

8381838 of course i support extending tax cuts for 98 of earners in this country
8381839 the madia release said madia has never renounced money from individuals or partnerships
8381840 what i havent been taking money from is corporate pacs
8381841 what i havent been taking money from is corporate pacs and the reason i havent is because i think right now that corporations exercise too much influence in washington d c whether its the energy companies insurance companies or the pharmaceutical companies and i think its undeniable that they have effected policy by paying by funding campaigns of both parties and so im proud of the fact that im not taking money from them
8381842 madia has called for removing corporate tax breaks for oil companies something paulsen did not address in his presentation rosenberg said madia will not accept any corporate pac money from the energy industry or any other corporate political action committee

8381851 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8381852 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8381853 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8381854 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8381855 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8381856 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8381857 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8381858 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk

8381884 during underground construction in london around the year 2008 a huge hibernating dragon is discovered and springs to life instantly incinerating all construction workers with its fiery breath the only survivor is 12 year old quinn abercromby whose mother was chief of the construction crew the dragon escapes and soon thousands of them work their way through europe and eventually the rest of the world burning everything feeding on the ashes and multiplying at an exponential rate by late 2010 as the news accounts reveal the world powers begin to use their most powerful weapons which only hastens the destruction of the planet and soon all semblance of organized government and society falls apart save for small communities of survivors twelve years later in 2020 the adult quinn runs a medieval stone castle in northumberland a lonely bastion of mankind afraid of the sky and the dragons that could attack any time their hope is to outlast the dragons wait until they die out again as they presumably did several times before and go into hibernation

8381912 we have to talk the senior police will talk about what to do next
8381913 we are going to wait here and wait for them to come in and get us
8381914 they have broken the law and it could be a serious setback for them
8381915 the government has a lot of options they have time on their side
8381916 well i just married this beautiful young woman she babies me cooks me gourmet meals and gives me mind blowing sex every day
8381917 i was piloting starships will you young whippersnappers were still swimming around the bottoms of your incubator tubes
8381918 yeah i hear he flew his first one at kitty hawke
8381919 how can you forget where you parked a 50 000 ton starship captain
8381920 well if the sound of spocks hearing aid wasnt distracting me then maybe i could think my goodness man youve got ears on you like a jackass i dont see why youd need a hearing aid
8381921 on monday the rubber dinghy started taking water and it overturned with the immigrants drowned
8381922 they just kept holding on to the dinghy until last night they were spotted by the maltese fishing vessel
8381923 my appeal goes to the government to release these immigrants from the detention centre because of their health and traumatic conditions
8381924 notwithstanding that they know about previous tragedies these desperate people still try and make the journey to europe
8381925 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound
8381926 he one of the hijackers said no one should move from their place if anybody moves well blow the plane your all become nothing we become nothing everything becomes nothing
8381927 we couldnt move we couldnt even scratch our heads we couldnt go to the toilet no water nothing
8381928 i was so hysterical i thought it was a disaster
8381929 if you choose to depart from your philosophy if you choose to be politically expedient then you need to explain it
8381930 there will be a vote and the liberal party will have to sit there with the greens and vote down energy privatisation
8381931 barry ofarrell has to explain today why the proposals that weve got other than issues to do with politics he has got to explain financially economically and in the public interest
8381932 let me make this absolutely clear this will not be revisited in a years time
8381933 the labor party has exhausted itself in doing the right thing by the public if it goes down today it is over
8381934 but the opposition will still have a policy of privatising electricity when it goes to the election in 2011 and we will make sure that the public knows that thats their policy
8381935 if you can use private funds to do what is required and you can regulate those to get the outcomes that you want then the public sector is better off spending money on hospitals and schools
8381936 im not a seat warmer i dont sit around because im unemployable to pick up a salary at the public expense
8381937 im here because there are things to be done and if these things are not to be undertaken im not just talking about electricity but other reforms certainly there is no role for me in the nsw parliament

8381941 i designed the convertible packing cube backpack as a in fact i think its the first product weve made that was 100 inspired by customer feedback many of the details of course reflect my design experience and my sewing crew helped to refine some of the subtleties of the construction over all it was truly a group effort
8381942 decided to actually use the cube backpack as it was intended it holds a large amount as a packing cube since i was using a new different bag i was able to also pack the smaller narrow compartment on the bottom of the cube almost everything i was carrying fit in the cube 4 shirts 1 pair shorts 1 pair slacks pjs yeah i know 3 pair underwear and socks workout clothing before putting in the bag i wandered around using it as a backpack surprisingly comfortable and easy to get on and off its well constructed and amazingly light when empty
8381943 there will be a new version of the song on itunes in a short while
8381944 what we know is that there is something wrong with the version sent to itunes
8381945 the version we have received does not contain similar errors
8381946 oh my god this is unfortunately a classic example of how bad things get when studio technicians and musicians gets to play with expensive compressors and limiters
8381947 the file is a 313 kbps aac sound file which isnt necessarily that bad but someone has chosen to maximize the volume with a compressor so much so that the whole sound file just sounds like mud the cymbals sound like broken glass the drums like trees cracking and the guitars which are mixed equally loudly sound like someone shoved a screwdriver into my ears
8381948 i have never heard anything like this on songs we have added to the archive it is probably not a technical error the file was like that when we received it from universal music
8381949 we can only hope that the cd wont sound this bad but i dont have high hopes that this will happen
8381950 this is not how it will sound on the album
8381951 weve identified the source of the problem to prevent it in any subsequent singles released in advance of september 12
8381952 it is believed that the source of the problem lies in the actual mix and not the mastering
8381953 someone has chosen to maximize the volume with a compressor
8381954 thrash rehash kill em all solos style thing should be beneath them as musicans
8381955 were have all heard this story the real story today are the new dates for la chicago and newark
8381956 if it had been an mp3 encoding issue or an issue with the mastering there would have been a new better quality file out there already there isnt
8381957 a mastering error is very very bad news a mastering error means the cds are screwed
8381958 the official guy never admitted there was a mastering error so i dunno what youre talking about they were trying to say it was encoded to mp3 badly but youve got to make a real effort to screw that up so it sounds as bad as those two songs learn your terminology before you start talking crap
8381959 the new mp3 file sounds as bad as the first one go read the posts on the metallica message board so there isnt a better file therefore it isnt an mp3 encoding issue like i said it takes five minutes to upload a new file they are still streaming that distorted pile of shit on their website
8381960 maybe they can bring bob rock in to mix it real quick
8381961 in here didnt get it yet i happen to be a metal expert spanning all genres of metal i know everything about metal and hard rock producers drumming being one that would wipe the floor with lars all day i own over 800 cds and to put it bluntly theres no one in this site that can match my shear knowledge of metal music i am a true know it all
8381962 who is the fucking junior who did this its unbelievable and they are selling this quality via itunes right now

8382131 kids can be very mean its human nature to be really we were all mean to someone at some point in time but its our job as parents to make sure that our kids dont go overboard with being judgemental to others based on their appearance who their parents are or what kind of material things they do and dont have it also takes some mature and upstanding behavior from the parents youd think grown folks would know better parents can often be more competitive than the kids they want to live through their kids instead of letting their kids live and be content comfortable with themselves no matter what others think all the kids are precious and deserve the same care and attention

8382155 as an association dedicated to providing travel agents with an unfettered environment in which to do business we feel this issue to be of critical importance
8382156 this measure places a disproportionately enormous economic and punitive burden on travel agents and as if this werent enough is in direct conflict with multiple constitutional provisions
8382157 travel agents are the largest and most vital part of our distribution system
8382158 and while carnival has always enjoyed an excellent relationship with the travel agent community this new executive forum offers an opportunity to enhance our dialogue with agents while seeking new ways to make them more successful and profitable in todays marketplace

8382168 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8382169 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8382170 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8382171 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8382172 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8382173 what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country any nation could be next when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country

8382186 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8382187 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8382188 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8382189 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8382190 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8382191 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people

8382202 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8382203 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8382204 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8382205 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8382206 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8382207 obstinate men and uncircumcised in hearts and ears you are always resisting the holy spirit as your forefathers did so you do 52 which one of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute yes they killed those who made announcement in advance concerning the coming of the righteous one whose betrayers and murderers you have now become 53 you who received the law as transmitted by angels but have not kept it

8382228 we have a situation here where they are making things a crime that are not a crime
8382229 it is clear that the inerrancy debate is settled among the sbc pastors we surveyed they all believe in inspiration with a very small percent not also affirming inerrancy this is a remarkably high number
8382230 in the southern baptist convention the battle for the bible is over and won
8382231 the numbers remind us that we still have work to do
8382232 yes we have settled the issue of the authority of scripture in our confession that battle is over and done however i believe that the battle for the authority and sufficiency of gods word is never really done it is as old as the garden of eden and will continue until jesus comes back as we can see southern baptists pastors are overwhelmingly inerrantists but they are also discerning enough to know that we must always be on guard against compromise and error
8382233 the bible is the written word of god and is totally accurate in all that it teaches
8382234 the bible is the authoritative source of truth and wisdom for daily living
8382235 while southern baptist pastors are united in their view of the inerrancy of scripture they must be aware that 1 out of 4 people who attend their churches each month consider the bible less than totally accurate or authoritative

8382245 its something we have to keep our eyes on more and more and more going forward
8382246 it takes your breath away a little bit because obviously it represents a huge potential resource i think right now were still trying to get our hands around the existing amount of capacity the idea of putting that much more in over the next couple years it raises a lot of important questions and things we really need to get our attention on as quickly as possible
8382247 of course you want to use the wind when it comes along because it is a free fuel and you want to make the best use of it you can
8382248 the biggest problem it turns out for wind is when it blows at night when theres not much usage on the system when you have too much supply and not enough demand that turns out to be the most interesting situation
8382249 you have a lot of hydro you have a lot of gas in pipelines you have a lot of coal in piles you have a lot of customers who could use or not use their own resources theres a lot of play in that system
8382250 if you look at the example of denmark or spain or northern germany these are places that are getting fifteen to twenty percent of their energy from wind without the lights going out

8382258 if you choose to depart from your philosophy if you choose to be politically expedient then you need to explain it
8382259 there will be a vote and the liberal party will have to sit there with the greens and vote down energy privatisation
8382260 barry ofarrell has to explain today why the proposals that weve got other than issues to do with politics he has got to explain financially economically and in the public interest
8382261 let me make this absolutely clear this will not be revisited in a years time
8382262 the labor party has exhausted itself in doing the right thing by the public if it goes down today it is over
8382263 but the opposition will still have a policy of privatising electricity when it goes to the election in 2011 and we will make sure that the public knows that thats their policy
8382264 if you can use private funds to do what is required and you can regulate those to get the outcomes that you want then the public sector is better off spending money on hospitals and schools

8382269 the state governments emphatic promise to defend our iconic natural assets from wind facilities is in tatters with the revelation that acciona energy has been allowed to build a 50 million 15 turbine wind farm on the doorstep of the twelve apostles and the great ocean road
8382270 at the 2006 election then energy minister theo theophanous declared that all sensitive areas including the great ocean road would be protected from wind farm development a promise that rings hollow today
8382271 the consideration of impacts of wind farms particularly in the great ocean road area are stringent and are subject to very tight controls
8382272 wind and other renewable energy resources will play a key role for victoria as we change our energy mix generating our power from a wider range of sources as we drive down greenhouse gas emissions

8382287 i think of all the headaches and fires that i have to put out and the problems that i have which are all the necessary steps to acquire a billboard and the pressure of making sure this show better live up to that billboard but its the thing you wish for so how can you really ever complain

8382293 when you learn today you make a better tomorrow it makes you do better siting and planning
8382294 one of the one important things weve learned is to engage the residents and the community early in the process to ensure that factual information is available
8382295 for any project to proceed to get the final permits developers have to deal with about 90 different agencies which are federal provincial and municipal
8382296 at the end of the day you have to navigate through all these different levels of government and various agencies to make sure all the requirements are met
8382297 every once and a while i run across people like you every single time i am equally sympathetic yet still somewhat feel hopeful for your mindset and perception
8382298 sad ignorant and obviously oblivious close mindedness is the glorification of things one does not know fall down the hole of heroin and one day you will find your neck covered in one big black yoke of regret
8382299 my tattoo is not for you or anyone else i most certainly do not need for anyone to understand what i have been through nor my motivations for gettin it part of what you say makes a bit of sense on one level but its downplayed by your urge to send someone a horribly tasteless email for no reason you have made the choice to spread negativity for no reason other than proving yourself incompetent if heroin is something that you are going through because that is where you took it no where do you see heroin anywhere on my body then i strongly hope you can get through the choices that you have made i understand it is hard for you to see or believe there are ideas and beliefs out here that have nothing to do with you but i hope very much you can heal yourself from needlessly spreading negativity
8382300 yes and indeed when recovering or existing addicts see your stupid tats i hope it is an equally healing experience for them does that make you feel good about yourself to put those ridiculous images on your body what reason could or would anyone possibly ever have to do this it is stupid and one day you will regret this stupidity honestly you are clearly a clueless young man
8382301 oh and i know that you will spew fourth yet more pontification and rationalizations but uh humor me humor yourself why pray tell would you put these particular images on your body do you even have a response to this question i think not
8382302 you are correct i do not have a response that you are worthy of please be a fuckin adult and leave me alone if this is all you can offer now you have just gotten hilarious

8382400 safety considerations for the clinical application of human embryonic stem cells
8382401 we are honored that the fda has invited us to participate in this panel which could be influential in shaping the clinical pathway for the testing of embryonic stem cells
8382402 as one of the few stem cell companies that is preparing for later stage clinical trials we are pleased that we will be able to share our views with fda executives and other distinguished members of the scientific community on the safety issues surrounding human embryonic stem cell development
8382403 live to 150 can you do it secrets to living longer
8382404 without creating a human embryo for research purposes or destroying discarding or subjecting to harm a human embryo or fetus
8382405 the actcellerate initiative large scale combinatorial cloning of novel human embryonic stem cell derivatives
8382406 this is an enormously exciting development for the regen sector the research reported represents a quantum leap forward in embryonics the mapping and characterization of the cells of early human development without any doubt the actcellerate technology will greatly hasten the translation of human embryonic stem cell based therapies into safe and effective products for routine clinical practice
8382407 we are greatly indebted to mike west for his insight in initiating this program during his tenure with act and to the entire act scientific team for their perseverance in bringing this groundbreaking research to the conclusions described in this publication act has taken great strides in identifying both clinical applications for this approach as well as for the actcellerate cell line library for drug target discovery assay development and direct therapeutics development across a wide spectrum of clinical indications we are now in a position to offer our refined technology and know how to potential partners and licensees
8382408 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
8382409 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy
8382410 we show that up to 65 of the blood cells underwent multiple maturation events that resulted in the extrusion of the nucleus
8382411 they formed enucleated erythrocytes with a diameter of 6 8 m which is similar to normal red blood cells we also showed that the cells could express adult globin and respond normally to biochemical changes
8382412 although more work is required before this can move into the clinic we are pleased with the rapid progress that is being made by our scientists and others we are optimistic about the potential future role for stem cells as a donorless source of blood for transfusion
8382413 the drivers include climate change oil depletion energy security deregulation new technologies like nanomaterial biotech and information technologies which allow you to manage distributed energy resources in a way we couldnt 15 years ago all these trends coming together at once create an enormously powerful transformation and opportunities to invest

8382635 hunter biden met with the obama senate office not with senator obama
8382636 its hardly surprising that a senator from illinois would fight for investments in mercy hospital thorek hospital and st xavier university right in illinois or that hed be joined in that effort by a republican colleague representative judy biggert

8382639 two years ago we graduated more african american and hispanic nurses than any private college in the state of illinois
8382640 im not at all apologetic that we asked for federal support for huge health care needs of this growing community
8382641 he was a crucial supporter of the law in that he paved the way for other democrats to support it

8382650 this is the promise which he himself made to us eternal life
8382651 this is the only work god wants from you believe in the one he has sent
8382652 so now there is no condemnation for those who belong to christ jesus 2 and because you belong to him the power of the life giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death

8382684 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8382685 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8382889 this report proves that florida could rebalance long term care and draw down additional federal dollars if our states leaders would agree to do so other states have done so successfully
8382890 with services for florida elders and children already slashed to the bone we hope that this report points the way toward a better model using home and community based services for older adults and those living with disabilities
8382891 this underscores the need for better government and private sector financing options for long term care americans have few options to plan and pay for their long term care balancing medicaid ltc options will require a commitment from our state officials and cooperation from federal authorities to do what hcbs can be both cost effective and responsive to the preferences of older people and adults with disabilities
8382892 no lot in said tract shall at any time be lived upon by any person whose blood is not entirely that of the caucasian race and for the purpose of this paragraph no japanese chinese mexican hindu or any other person of the ethiopian indian or mongolian races shall be deemed to be caucasian

8382901 both the use of this word and the appalling portrayal of an intellectually disabled character in this movie are incredibly damaging to people with intellectual disabilities
8382902 this movie perpetuates use of a hateful word the disability community is trying to eradicate from our countrys vocabulary although the movie is considered satire this depiction of a person with intellectual disabilities is far from funny
8382903 one of the biggest challenges for people with intellectual disabilities is when society encourages this portrayal of them
8382904 its almost the worst adversity they face people like tara can do phenomenal things shes very highly accomplished
8382905 as a person with a disability the movie didnt make me feel good

8382911 jesus went through all the towns and villages teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness when he saw the crowds he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd
8382912 then he said to his disciples the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few
8382913 called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness

8382924 medvedev is more interested in economic reform than he is in this conflict
8382925 but it is putin and the hardliners who are making the decisions
8382926 they had to say we are back and we are strong
8382927 the process has its own dynamic medvedev had no choice but to recognize the breakaway republics
8382928 i dont hope the new raison detre for europe would be a cold war anyone who talks about that should think for a while about what kind of military and ideological confrontation that was between blocs and whether we want to move in that direction

8382932 i think a small percentage will sit out the election but a larger percentage of republicans dont like mccain and will vote for obama
8382933 hillary understands that some of her strongest supporters are grieving and shes showing them shes done grieving and moving on
8382934 i reserve the right to criticize him criticize his activists his volunteers and every apparatus of the obama campaign but ill vote for him

8382953 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8382954 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8382955 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8382956 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8382957 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8382958 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8382959 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8382960 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8382961 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8382962 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8382963 more excitement to the idea of using reprogramming as a way to treat diabetes
8382964 i wake up every day thinking about how to make beta cells
8382965 marc edouard is one of the top young defenseman in the game and we are excited to have him in the fold for the next several years
8382966 he has a tremendous future with this franchise and we look forward to watching his continued development
8382967 instead of us being on defense on social wedge issues weve got to put him on defense about peoples checkbooks
8382968 you know i am not going to take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who have spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton every day
8382969 i think it is unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics
8382970 its no accident for example that they hired howard wolfson they use him as some sort of little toy soldier waiting on the shelf
8382971 tokyo rose was the thought the came to my mind
8382972 he had a long black handgun he was holding in front of him
8382973 the only thing that messed him up is he was trying to pull his pants up
8382974 we dont try to protect our data amp come up with new formats only for marketing reasons we use existing standards as much as possible and allow fl studio to be used as a plugin in other hosts
8382975 in some cases its just a front for drug dealers or people looking to get high every day
8382976 it shows that the state is willing to support the law in so far as the law itself is implemented in accordance with the will of the voters and that is that patients have access to alternative remedies
8382977 we had a chance to look at it and basically it states the law as its written and it doesnt come into conflict with anything that weve done in the past
8382978 its puzzling that they said they were following the law all along and that things wont change because since the earlier case the court has established that the district attorney has no good legal reason to oppose a request to return the property
8382979 we recognize that the claim detailed in the presentation by the researcher about bitlocker is correct
8382980 this theoretical attack is only possible in targeted situations and while probable its very unlikely
8382981 like all full volume encryption products bitlocker has a key in memory when the system is running in order to encrypt decrypt data on the fly for the drive s in use
8382982 if a system is in sleep mode it is in effect still running
8382983 if you spread yourself too thin too early you end up getting nothing
8382984 the eeoc is doing everything it can to provide agencies with useful guidance on how to be the nations model employer providing equal opportunity to all americans including those with disabilities
8382985 even though the rehabilitation act of 1973 has long required federal agencies to engage in affirmative action to hire and advance individuals with disabilities the federal government has failed to meet this challenge
8382986 this question and answer guide will help agencies make concrete progress

8383004 there were some who said we should be silent about our differences on issues during this convention but the heritage of the democratic party has been a history of democracy we fight hard because we care deeply about our principles and purposes we did not flee this struggle

8383019 after much speculation i can confirm that gareth barry will not leave aston villa before the transfer window closes
8383020 gareth made the decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8383021 during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8383022 any talks regarding potential new contracts at aston villa will not take place until the end of the season

8383057 we looked very hard at how people really browse the web we looked at a lot of data about how people browse and tried a lot of different designs in front of many kinds of people not just technologists
8383058 ie8 takes into account that there are often relationships between new tabs that users open and the browser can make it a lot easier to figure out which tabs go with which
8383059 because youre actively engaged in developing and maintaining websites microsoft wants to make you aware of a display issue related to internet explorer 8
8383060 upon initial release browsing in default internet explorer 8 standards mode may cause content written for previous versions of internet explorer to display differently than intended to enable existing content to display as expected microsoft is providing a compatibility tag that you can add to sites that might be affected this tag instructs internet explorer 8 to display site content as if it were in internet explorer 7 this option helps ensure that existing content will continue to display seamlessly in internet explorer 8 without requiring any additional code changes

8383075 at a time when families and businesses are having to cut back gordon brown is increasing spending on promoting himself and his government spending on pr and advertising has rocketed under gordon browns premiership by over four times the rate of inflation and now labour want to spend even more
8383076 it is a sign of just out of how out of touch gordon brown is with the situation facing ordinary people that he thinks it reasonable to let rip with spending on pr and advertising while telling everyone else they have to tighten their belts

8383086 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
8383087 this was another solid financial quarter for tivo as we continued to improve our financial profile by posting substantially better than guided adjusted ebitda of 10 6 million and net income of 2 9 million
8383088 during the quarter we made significant progress in several key areas of our business in terms of our mass distribution strategy comcast has reaffirmed its long term support for our partnership as evidenced by its roll out in connecticut our international footprint continues to grow with sevens successful introduction of tivo to the australian market and on the standalone side of the business with the recent addition of youtube content delivered right to the tv set our vision of creating the ultimate television dream machine is coming to fruition as subscribers now have access to the broadest array of content options and features in the world delivering consumers what they want when they want it
8383089 we are pleased with the progress of the tivo service and have broadened its footprint in our new england market to connecticut refinements to optimize the products performance have been mostly completed significantly improving the user experience importantly we intend to light up a full marketing campaign around tivo in september and upon this occurring we will be announcing multiple additional markets to which tivo will be rolled out through next year we will also continue to fund development work for the tivo product which will include expanding the feature set and adding support for tru2way infrastructure
8383090 additionally the tivo service on cox which is currently in trials is on track for a launch in coxs new england market later this year
8383091 on the international front seven and tivo successfully launched the tivo service in australia and because of the significant consumer demand there retailers chose to release the product early we are also extremely pleased with the marketing shoulder seven is putting behind this launch as theyve prominently featured tivo in their marketing and programming including the olympic opening ceremonies their top rated morning show and a special advertising spot they developed which includes dozens of australian celebrities international distribution is an increasingly important component of our business model and there continues to be tremendous interest from international distributors for the tivo offering
8383092 in terms of our litigation with echostar and defending our intellectual property we are now in the enforcement phase of the process on september 4 2008 there is a contempt hearing scheduled to determine whether echostar is in contempt of the injunction that has already been upheld by the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit enjoining them from selling and operating infringing units as well as to determine further damages from echostars continued infringement after september 2006 we remain confident in the outcome and look forward to final resolution in the near future and to realizing the value of our intellectual property
8383093 on the tivo owned side of the business our goal of making our standalone product a comprehensive video solution one box one remote one user interface and a one stop shop for all content from all sources is becoming a reality we are continually adding more content choices to our offering and recently announced the availability of youtube tivo can now provide access to more television and broadband content choices than any other offering in the world with thousands of movies and televisions shows and millions of songs and videos available at any time
8383094 our continued efforts to focus on efficient marketing spend and to work with third parties who make their own marketing expenditures on behalf of tivo is underscored by the decline of our quarterly subscription acquisition costs sac to 135 a considerable decrease when compared to sac of 758 during the same period last year even considering that the prior years sac included the impact of the 11 2 million inventory reserve we are driving tivo sales through relationships with leading retailers and consumer electronic manufacturers that will also market the product for example we are currently working with many best buy stores in six of its larger markets where tivo is being made available as part of a special bundled offer as the recommended cable set top box of choice to be purchased with hd televisions also in these markets best buy is creating a tivo branded living room environment making the television entertainment experience as compelling as possible these efforts along with others will enable us to build on our standalone business while we also manage subscription acquisition costs and overall marketing expenditures
8383095 another key example of our partnering with third parties to use their marketing resources to drive tivo is the announcement we made today with the leading consumer entertainment industry magazine entertainment weekly we are teaming up with entertainment weekly to deliver and jointly market its what to watch tv picks directly to the television while tivo automatically records the recommended shows this ensures that broadband enabled tivo users always have these top picks available to watch whenever they tune in this partnership allows two powerful brands to work together to create a seamless television viewing experience underscoring tivos goal of providing easy solutions that bring together television viewing with an individuals lifestyle we are encouraged by the number of media companies that continue to express real interest in using tivos technology to help bring innovation to their existing business models and view these relationships as an opportunity to drive incremental subscriptions in an efficient manner tivo owned subscription gross additions for the second quarter were approximately 36 000 compared to 41 000 gross additions for the year ago period the tivo owned monthly churn rate was 1 5 up from 1 3 in the prior quarter and equivalent to the rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 overall tivo owned subscriptions ended the quarter at approximately 1 7 million as expected tivo reported a net decline in msos broadcaster subscriptions during the period as directv is no longer deploying new tivo boxes and other mass distribution deals are still in the early phases of deployment cumulative total subscriptions as of july 31 2008 were 3 6 million
8383096 we are also making solid progress in our advertising business tivo has created a number of ad solutions that are aimed at overcoming the enormous challenge facing the television industry as dvr based consumer control becomes even more pervasive we continue to build strong relationships with many television advertisers advertising agencies television networks and cable operators and are working with all of them to solve the issues that come with commercial avoidance the progress we have made is clear when compared to last years second quarter approximately 50 percent more advertisers utilized tivo in the second quarter of this year this is an indication that tivo will play a meaningful role in the future of television advertising
8383097 more specifically we continue to prove that our ad solutions are some of the most unique and innovative available to marketers we recently announced a deal with amazon that provides tivo users with the ability to purchase products from amazon com directly from their tv sets enabling advertisers to strategically promote merchandise on any network or program the new product purchase offering garnered significant media attention largely due to the fact that the new interactive advertising solution is consistent with how people actually watch television and brings immediacy to product purchase because it focuses on the media products themselves critical to its success viewers can pause what they are watching while searching for and purchasing merchandise right from their tv and then return to their show without having missed a second a component absent from previous failed interactive advertising efforts attempted by many over the years the application of this approach to the increased use of product placements as an advertising tool is also a very promising one
8383098 in regards to our audience research amp measurement business there is no more important issue to the business of television than understanding the impact of dvrs on viewing behavior tivo has been working closely with the media industry to help bring higher levels of measurability to tv advertising similar to those achieved on the internet during the quarter we launched our power watch tm ratings service that provides for the first time a report that gives commercial ratings in a dvr environment based on demographic data this powerful research tool is essentially a companion to our flagship stop watch tm ratings service which compiles second by second behavioral and viewership data from a separate anonymous sample a critical finding of our new ratings service is that all types of viewers are fast forwarding ads at high rates and the notion that only early adopters of tivo dvrs are skipping commercials has now been debunked
8383099 we also entered into an agreement with a leading media marketing research company tra to license anonymous viewing data from tivos standalone subscription base and market a bundled offering that provides marketers with the ability to get from a single source reports that measure the effectiveness of advertising by analyzing the long sought correlation between advertising and precise purchasing data emanating from the very households that viewed the advertising the tivo tra offering not only provides this unique view but does so on an unprecedented scale for up to one million households by utilizing a proprietary method of matching anonymous viewing behavior with purchasing behavior
8383100 we believe this quarter we delivered strong financial results and continued to gain traction in our mass distribution strategy continued to expand our advertising and audience research business and continued to take the necessary steps for us to successfully capitalize on the growth opportunities in our tivo owned business in the future we are beginning to see the results of our hard work and believe that we have all the right pieces set in motion to move the business forward
8383101 if out of all of this we dont end up with an assessment system that allows us at every step of the way to understand where the individual child is on the road to the next step after high school on to college on to the skilled workplace whether theyre behind theyre ahead theyre on track and itll help us understand how to intervene with that child to do the right thing and then allows us longitudinally to reassess at a point in the future to know whether our interventions work or not then i dont know why were even bothering to assess you know uh i dont know what the point is its all well and good to say this schools doing good by some standard and that schools doing good by some standard but if the students arent moving on to the next levels successfully if thats not what our focus is then i dont know why we even bother i dont care that school x is hitting better at some measure than school y i dont i care whether the kids that come out of that school are ready to move to the next level
8383102 if you are going to do an assessment of learning an accountability assessment an achievement assessment what you want are the students very best possible products thats probably measured on demand because of the reliability and validity factors
8383103 nous sommes toujours au travail le processus sest acc l r

8383105 you can see what it looked like then and what it looks like now draw your own conclusions
8383106 i dont go home and sit there and read the newspaper cover to cover every night i just dont
8383107 i dont wait for the next days newspaper to know how they did
8383108 newspapers are never going to make the profits they made before the internet
8383109 buying the weeklies is not good for communities when they bought the weeklies they basically stopped competing
8383110 it makes you wonder how were going to get local news in the future
8383111 public ownership creates a pressure to produce products that generate profits
8383112 in general the news media as a whole is letting us down less coverage less investigation less depth and no watchdogs any loss at all in the newsroom makes a bad situation worse
8383113 the current state of the economy is putting tremendous pressure on our business
8383114 im sure you are wondering if more reductions are coming
8383115 of course i would prefer no more reductions but we must keep expenses in line with revenue if advertising and circulation revenues continue to decline further payroll reductions may be necessary so it behooves us all to do everything we can to support revenue growth
8383116 when leslie was there i had folks in the community ask me who the heck is your publisher
8383117 the daily newspaper as we know it is disappearing the dead trees newspaper as we know it is rapidly shrinking
8383118 but at the same time the newspaper in terms of daily content written by expert writers is very much alive
8383119 by the time the last paper based newspaper disappears people will be happy
8383120 the quality will have become so diminished especially compared to what is being offered online the end of paper based newspapers is not the end of civilization as we know it it is simply a move into a different format
8383121 a great show great rum and a lot of sex
8383122 i think a musician is somebody who sits around and noodles on a guitar
8383123 entertainers are showing you a lot more it could be anything from frank sinatra to kiss where theres something going on a song and dance routine and id rather have that going on than be considered a musician
8383124 its the formula everybody uses to describe us you take one band plus another band and then you have to put them on a drug and then in a location like another planet
8383125 to try to understand what the hell weve accomplished making our own little genre
8383126 theres nothing you can do that i havent already done to myself
8383127 very rarely do you get anybody whos bored by it
8383128 i think we were sitting somewhere way way in the future and everybody just kinda caught up
8383129 i think selling out is if you just really change yourself so completely right away to hop onto whatever bandwagon is going on
8383130 its pretty hard for us considering our sound is so unique
8383131 well be more than happy to collect the giant check made out to mindless self indulgence for cash
8383132 we were all really close in middle school the thing about this group of gentlemen our strongest bond is our creative bond sometimes we dont have a lot to say to each other but when were writing a song we have a lot to say were getting to be friends again and theres definitely a us four against the world mentality as much as we are different i think were a lot the same
8383133 there was this force on my back that made me feel like i should do that but i got to college and i was a terrible student
8383134 i wasnt gonna force it i started writing songs and went back to the guys and it slowly the idea of getting us all back together i didnt even humor that because i didnt think it was gonna happen when everyone heard the songs they were all into it so when i started playing with taylor gary and jeff came back
8383135 its easier to come to someone who hasnt been in the band before he brought it to a whole other level of rock and roll what he brought to the band is something so important it opens it up to being this ambient spacey psychedelic rock band that we all want to be it brings everyone up a notch
8383136 its kind of like the elephant in the room or representing mystery or absurdity or something powerful it just made sense and we wanted an animal to help introduce ourselves to the world
8383137 theyve already been asking if were going to include it on the next one so were going to try and get that whale to evolve into something else
8383138 i think the whole album is about finding extraordinary things in the ordinary growing up in the suburbs and trying to find beauty there
8383139 it could have very easily been an alt country singer songwriter kind of band even though i write the songs that way we cant perform them that way were not that kind of band we love rock music

8383318 they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8383319 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in

8383332 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8383333 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event

8383336 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do

8383338 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8383339 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8383340 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes

8383349 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8383350 its been a really good weekend for me and ive throughly enjoyed myself i wasnt sure how everything would turn out but i spoke to rob mac and he was keen to see me out on the bike so i packed my bags on thursday and headed straight to the circuit obviously im well used to the r1 yamaha but it was still a bit new to me and i needed to work a bit on set up to begin with it was important that i kept my face famaliar to people in the bsb paddock and show them what i can do and 7th was a good start i was battling it out with all the championship front runners and was only a few tenths away from a podium spot so a big thank you to rob for giving me the opportunity
8383351 ive been speaking to a lot of people this last week and have now agreed deals that will see me out on the track for the rest of the year ill be riding for the aim yamaha team at the macau gp and will race the machine in the next round of the british superbike championship at croft to get fully dialled in with the bike prior to the race in the far east ill also be contesting the final two rounds of the superstock championship for team black horse racing yamaha so a big thank you must also go to alastair flanagan and ian lougher for all their help and assistance
8383352 finally i had a weekend without any bad luck where things went relatively smoothly for me
8383353 i was feeling healthy and it was definitely my best weekend of the year
8383354 i was expecting to do a little better but ive learned theres a lot to the racing scene i had things pretty easy last year but in racing anything can happen
8383355 i stretched some tendons and ligaments and i wasnt able to train and mosport didnt help the situation last monday was the first time ive been able to run since before the calabogie race ive really been chasing my tail all year
8383356 and i really like shannonville i like the pro track layout we use there im really looking forward to this weekend
8383357 doing just the canadian series which is five weekends its not too hectic and ive been able to keep my grades up

8383359 i dont mind the english and history ive finished my grade 12 biology courses but i really enjoyed those i used to be a big math student but not so much anymore its getting a little old physics is nice a lot of it applies to everyday life and you cant always say that about your courses
8383360 it was a big eye opener there are some pretty amazing riders down there but i think we have a lot of talent up here too and on the same equipment some of us canadians could be knocking on the top five
8383361 well see how the last round plays out this weekend but id like to do some more races down there im still young and ive only ridden so much for me its more about getting track time and getting more riding in
8383362 it has taken me some time to get this accomplished but it has been a goal of mine to one day own the business i have dedicated my life to
8383363 est n pensadas formuladas y son el instrumento para que el pueblo tenga participaci n plena
8383364 hemos sido los defensores constantes estamos haciendo letra viva la constituci n trabajando para que se cumpla
8383365 traten de decir la verdad la oposici n venezolana tiene como plataforma la mentira pero hay que recuperar la verdad es absolutamente necesario que dejemos de decir la mentira la verdad es la defensa de esta patria para construir la justicia
8383366 porque nosotros hemos logrado que los venezolanos participen activamente as vivan en democracia y sean parte de los compromisos del estado para darle poder al pueblo igualmente que los consejos comunales sean un elemento fundamental para la construcci n de los lineamientos del gobierno nacional
8383367 this was a long and challenging process for the player and for the team
8383368 this was a good example of the problem commissioner goodell has cited with the lack of a rookie pay scale were all happy that derrick can now focus on getting on the field being a jaguar and contributing to this team
8383369 there were some unusual challenges and plenty of room for honest differences of opinion
8383370 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous
8383371 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating
8383372 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8383373 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8383374 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8383375 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8383376 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8383377 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8383378 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8383379 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8383380 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8383381 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8383382 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8383383 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8383384 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8383385 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8383386 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8383387 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8383388 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8383389 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8383390 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8383391 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8383392 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8383393 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8383394 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8383395 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8383396 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8383397 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8383398 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8383399 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8383400 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8383401 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8383402 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
8383403 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go
8383404 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
8383405 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math
8383406 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
8383407 we expected that there will be attempts to disrupt the election process and infiltration is part of that gameplan forces that are behind the disruption want to show that they exist we are making all efforts to see that they do not get a upper hand they will be neutralized
8383408 consequently while infiltration bids along the loc continue militant outfits seem to be also turning their attention to the the 198 km long ib in j amp k now overall we have recorded around 150 infiltration bids already this year
8383409 many of the ceasefire violations have been accompanied by infiltration bids confirming the suspicion that pakistan army is again providing covering fire to infiltrators
8383410 theres no single platform for energy independence its not a question of either wind or clean coal solar or hydrogen oil or geothermal we need them all to create a strong american energy system a system built on american innovation
8383411 mikes tank was once in the movies so its rigged up with this propane and oxygen thing that lets the turret really fire
8383412 theyre fun to take out in the country and play with
8383413 are these like the greatest guy toys of all time you cant ask for much better toys than this
8383414 whenever he gets on the internet at night i worry
8383415 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8383416 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8383417 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8383418 my murdered molested son should have had the same rights as a living victim
8383419 ive had too much focus on keeping my family together and protecting my daughter fighting cancer for the last few years but now that this appears to be close to over im going to work on changing that
8383420 protocol buffers provides a more lightweight approach to serializing data than xml provides and also resolves some of the more niggling issues with xml
8383421 but on the other hand they are not as powerful as xml and are not as yet nearly as widely adopted
8383422 the ilog acquisition goes a long way in rounding out ibms bpm enabled by soa
8383423 we prefer to focus on our own initiatives to enhance diversity and inclusiveness in our workplace
8383424 with all leagues on any given cycle it can turn out that way or it can turn out that a disproportionate percentage were coaches of color that were hired
8383425 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8383426 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8383427 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8383428 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8383429 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy
8383430 just in talking to nellie today were talking about maybe spreading that ball around and getting scoring from different areas
8383431 marcus is more of a pass first point guard if at some point he thought he didnt get a chance in new jersey hes going to get a chance now
8383432 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8383433 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8383434 marc edouard is one of the top young defenseman in the game and we are excited to have him in the fold for the next several years
8383435 he has a tremendous future with this franchise and we look forward to watching his continued development
8383436 its sort of the transformation from weve got a problem
8383437 for the first time we have a very maryland specific assessment of what the effects of climate change will be
8383438 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
8383439 this is a win win situation for medicine and ethics
8383440 but these things always look easier on the blackboard than when you have do them in actual patients
8383441 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8383442 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8383443 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8383444 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8383445 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8383446 the problem seems to be the inability by the applicants to provide lending institutions with some form of security over the leased land and it just seems to be put together hastily i think
8383447 they indicated that they were prepared to back this scheme and we proceeded on the basis of assurances from a broad range of financial institutions that they would support the scheme
8383448 we certainly had a round of meetings yesterday at each workplace but weve had no real indication about any great detail from them
8383449 theres been no let up in what they intend to do
8383450 the real spelling problems occur when people have learnt the rules or have a bit of knowledge but make mistakes in how they apply this
8383451 previous studies have showed that the steep decline begins around five years before death
8383452 what we could see in our data is that these changes occur much earlier than thought
8383453 there is substantial acceleration in cognitive decline many years prior to death among individuals without dementia
8383454 it isnt a routine case of murder loot and burning in this case members of a particular community were singled out burned alive and their properties looted such lawlessness needs to be sternly dealt with
8383455 that is not the best time to tell the risk to the patient

8383462 everyone wants to use their own voice to endorse obama
8383463 thats a ludacris suggestion and given the number of shady characters and organizations that have endorsed barack obama we find it hard to believe the obama campaign has turned down any endorsements at all
8383464 i feel about this introduction the way i felt about sophies choice it could have been funnier

8383472 housing seems to be stabilising businesses are spending money and consumer confidence is edging up while we should not expect to see any major upturn in activity the rest of this year we could evade having any quarter post negative growth

8383485 this is a great day for the people of montana we are clearly on the road to getting rid of electricity deregulation
8383486 this is the right project in the right place at the right time it is exactly what meic had hoped would happen when we supported the bill at the 2007 legislature to allow the utility to own and control power plants
8383487 this application moves us another step toward the price stability and operational benefits that utility owned rate based supply can provide over the long term

8383498 moldova should draw its own positive conclusions after the conflict in south ossetia
8383499 it is simply impossible to have moldova behave in a similar way to georgia
8383500 i believe that in moldova the leaders will use their wisdom to not allow such a bloody and catastrophic trend of events
8383501 there is no intention to escalate the situation in the security zone a demilitarized area along the dniester river and i believe that there shouldnt be any

8383510 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
8383511 the arabians pay homage to i know not what god which they represent by a quadrangular stone
8383512 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8383513 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8383514 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8383515 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8383516 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8383517 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8383518 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8383519 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8383520 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8383521 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8383522 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8383523 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8383524 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8383525 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8383526 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8383527 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8383528 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8383529 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8383530 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8383531 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8383532 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8383533 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

8383535 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8383536 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8383537 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8383538 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8383539 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8383540 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8383541 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8383542 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8383543 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8383544 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8383545 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8383546 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8383547 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

8383553 its a platform for people to come together and make a community on their own terms its not about us dictating what the community will be but consulting with community to see what they need
8383554 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
8383555 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
8383556 e che ci posso fare mica sono io a saltare addosso a loro

8383558 i dont know why you would go to the website and sign up for this and then not actually do it dont do it because it says something about you do it because you really mean it

8383817 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff

8383890 apple believed the ad was not about technical details or the functionalities or plug ins that were available on the iphone but the varied websites that users could visit and utilise they said all the websites featured in the ad were available on the iphone and were shown as they would be seen by the user they said none of the content in the ad was flash or java based and the ad did not mention any other technical capabilities of the iphone
8383891 youll never know which part of the internet youll need

8383894 the high rate of inflation has put a spanner in the works of good economic growth
8383895 if one takes a look at the financial scope of private households christmas trading is unlikely to be very impressive
8383896 we have been monitoring traffic for a long time and trends dont just happen for no reason in the past six months congestion has eased quite significantly the credit crunch is clearly the reason for that
8383897 rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at slower and more economical speeds
8383898 part of the reason for these decreases is simply that there are fewer cars on the road as the price of fuel is making it too expensive for people to drive
8383899 peoples budgets are being squeezed and what is happening is that they are changing their driving habits while they are not necessarily getting rid of their cars they arent driving as often or they are perhaps car sharing to save money
8383900 the figures show that congestion has steadily continued to ease over the past six months it will be very interesting to see what happens over the next year or so because the credit crunch looks like its going to continue
8383901 it is true that people appear to be aware of what is known as eco driving they realise that if they drive slower they will be able to make a tank of fuel go that bit further its quite sensible when you consider most people will be paying upwards of 60 for a tank of fuel
8383902 it does not surprise me in the least to hear that the price of fuel and the countrys economic situation is driving people off the road i think that what is happening is that people are continuing to make necessary journeys but they are cutting down on social driving

8383963 ive spent a lot of time thinking about this and i feel that john stephen is the one candidate who can best protect the taxpayers of manchester and new hampshire
8383964 hes the true fiscal conservative in this race i know that john will do the hard work to keep taxes low and has the discipline to say no to new spending he also is totally focused on finding solutions not continuing the bickering we see in congress thats just what we need right now in washington
8383965 he has taken what was an annual discussion about how big the tax increases would be to a focus on ways of cutting spending and bringing efficiency while delivering results thats the type of approach that i will bring to washington i am thrilled to have the mayors support and look forward to working with him in congress
8383966 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8383967 i knew there was a possibility so it wasnt a complete shock when i got called in and was told i would be scratched from the lineup due to precautionary reasons the club was in discussions for possibly moving me
8383968 if thats the case if im moved to a club that has postseason possibilities you cant be disappointed as a player
8383969 ive had a lot of fun here and ive been happy with bobby cox and the organization
8383970 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
8383971 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8383972 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8383973 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8383974 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8383975 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8383976 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8383977 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8383978 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8383979 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8383980 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8383981 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8383982 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8383983 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
8383984 i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things

8383987 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
8383988 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
8383989 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
8383990 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
8383991 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
8383992 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
8383993 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
8383994 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
8383995 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
8383996 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
8383997 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
8383998 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
8383999 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
8384000 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
8384001 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8384002 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
8384003 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
8384004 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
8384005 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
8384006 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
8384007 man is not born to solve the problems of the universe but to find out what he has to do

8384020 nothings really changed with him he looks really good really fluid out there on the ice you wouldnt think that hes had a bad knee injury
8384021 i guess in the long run it might have been better for me just to have that time to heal up and kind of put the injury behind me and be back 100 percent
8384022 hes stubborn and hell do things his own way with how hard he works that just makes his leg that much stronger im sure thats in the back of his mind way in the back of his mind
8384023 i think the only difference next season would be that if you start out slow or you have a bit of a lull everyone starts looking at it like oh youre older and you had a knee injury as opposed to just having lulls that you have every year
8384024 your grace period is zero when you get to be older

8384032 c 1 8 billion over three years will be returned to taxpayers through personal income tax and business tax cuts
8384033 when it comes to the problem of family disintegration we are like a deer in the headlights
8384034 everyone is affected by the issue but were afraid to address it because we know none of us is perfect unfortunately that allows the problem to grow and the price tag keeps expanding its time we put more effort into enacting policies that support marriages and help families both survive and thrive

8384036 while government cannot fix everything it can do a lot more than were doing today to help preserve families

8384039 the difference between working on a desk and trying to get work done on the little tray on an airplane
8384040 this report adds to the growing number of indications that the major problems may be easing
8384041 housing seems to be stabilising businesses are spending money and consumer confidence is edging up while we should not expect to see any major upturn in activity the rest of this year we could evade having any quarter post negative growth
8384042 global agriculture is already producing food for six billion people producing food based biofuel too will require that still more land be converted to agriculture
8384043 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8384044 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8384045 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8384046 lebanese citizens have been dreaming about this center for decades
8384047 its visit should be an enchantment and a pleasure rigidity routine conformity static are to be banned from its functioning and the presentation of its activities
8384048 the feedback from both students and the communities has been extremely positive
8384049 we are really pleased with the enthusiasm for community engagement which students have been showing
8384050 students are applying on the ground what they have been learning in the classroom
8384051 they also learn how to deal with different cultures and societies in return communities have been really appreciating the fact that aub students are taking 10 days off to spend time with them the end result is a lot of cultural exchange and discovering a common ground that brings people together despite their differences
8384052 with the camps support the families would cook meals for the students at their homes which encourages a two way interaction between the students and the local families
8384053 for instance we were expecting 15 students to sign up for a computer skills training workshop in one of the villages but 120 showed up and still counting
8384054 we represent imam sadrs school of justice and we want nothing but for justice to prevail
8384055 if the issue of imam sadrs disappearance is a great national cause as the national unity government has mentioned in its ministerial statement for the first time we hope that oral initiatives become a reality

8384060 they grew wheat and lentils they had figs prickly pears the goodness of god
8384061 in winter my goats cant live here but down there they can live
8384062 incidents may take place of livestock crossing from one side to another at times there are allegations of shepherds also crossing over
8384063 were willing to discuss in the framework of peace talks with lebanon any issue they want to bring to the table
8384064 obviously when we hold peace talks with the syrians and i hope we do have direct talks with the syrians then ultimately we have to agree to a border between our two countries so both sides will put their territorial visions on the table
8384065 if unifil solves it fine with us if hizbullah solves it fine with us in the end we want our land
8384066 we dont want hizbullah to liberate the farms for us we want the lebanese state to liberate it peacefully
8384067 we are against hizbullahs presence here what is important for us is legitimacy and the lebanese army and unifil
8384068 jamil sayyeds lawyers in france have filed the lawsuit against mehlis for distorting the investigation and calling false witnesses
8384069 he wanted to make sure we got everything done in time
8384070 and how fast they are in just an hour a student made this basket
8384071 now that we do have these programs and there is media coverage parents are more interested in talking about their problems
8384072 he is very happy he loves the programs anything with the school is sacred for him
8384073 build up the skills of fighting groups and preserve their efficiency
8384074 what was remarkable in this maneuver was that six field guns were firing several shots toward the sea at the same time
8384075 while planning for this maneuver our priority was to avoid bothering the local population in residential areas
8384076 unifils navy and lebanese ships have provided security in the sea
8384077 south lebanon has been turned into an arena for hizbullah activities
8384078 such actions by the future movement represent a coup against the doha agreement and an attempt to spread tension and chaos in the country
8384079 precisely what are pahs and why are they significant to astrobiology
8384080 will contribute to the efforts by the international community to stabilize lebanon and the whole region and to restore its prosperity
8384081 a stable lebanon is a step toward more stability in the whole region
8384082 thousands of incoming ships have been checked via radio and if necessary been boarded already
8384083 the un is deploying military contingents around the world in order for them to sow peace and stability and not fight
8384084 belgium is a small country that works for establishing peace a mission that is considered risky and hazardous
8384085 we hope to remain in lebanon for the sake of this mission
8384086 not only do they contribute to stability in the region the belgian troop engages with the local community and always tries to do its utmost to assist and protect the local population on the medical and development levels
8384087 as a defense minister i worry about my soldiers in any place in the world yes i am concerned about threats
8384088 my country will continue to contribute to clearing the southern land from cluster bombs and unexploded munitions
8384089 if everything goes according to plan then i can say the cellular rates will fall in less than three months after the privatization of the mobile networks
8384090 i also pledge that two years after the implementation of the plan not only will we have a modern network available in lebanon but we can achieve a higher economic growth with the increased penetration of the cellular networks
8384091 if the plan is implemented fully lebanon will become a leader in the telecom in the region in five years
8384092 i dont think the current operators or the telecommunication ministry have the financial resources or the time to expand the cell networks in such a short period this capacity expansion will probably be left to the firms that will buy the majority shares of the mobile networks
8384093 as a matter of fact more companies have expressed interest in taking part in the cellular auction
8384094 the contract will be with a chinese company to build three dams two in equatoria and the third in bahr al ghazal
8384095 now as you know many chinese companies would like to come here to look forward to the chances the opportunities for cooperation
8384096 the right to study crosses borders and conflict we all have the right to study
8384097 the spot was not approved for broadcast in the format the advertiser requested because it contains a controversial political message
8384098 commercials with controversial political messages cannot go on the air
8384099 articulates uncontroversial norms acknowledging the supreme importance of higher education as well as the duty of the state of israel to facilitate the realization of aspirations for those seeking to pursue education
8384100 theres also a chilling effect because the longer students are prevented from leaving the fewer apply
8384101 exposing palestinians to a pluralistic and democratic academic environment can only have a positive impact upon the students who could help bring such values back to palestinian society
8384102 we found the abducted japanese man he had been shot several times
8384103 we started a massive search operation to rescue him but unfortunately the abductors killed him
8384104 police closed the circle on the kidnappers that is why they left him there bleeding
8384105 the international community must open up to syria following the example set by france because syria plays a fundamental role at the regional level
8384106 developments in bilateral lebanese syrian relations after the presidential summit in damascus were the focus of talks between sleiman and the us delegation
8384107 israel has no right to issue such threats especially since lebanon is abiding to un security council resolution 1701 which is being continuously violated by israel
8384108 the israeli threats are direct violations of 1701 and i warn israel against carrying on its threats
8384109 we reject any threat to the unity and sovereignty of lebanon especially from israel
8384110 yesterday tuesday we spoke with the israelis during defense minister ehud baraks visit to egypt and asked them to stop thinking about threatening this friendly arab country
8384111 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hizbullah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hizbullah
8384112 we are ready to improve the lebanese armys capabilities this way it will be able to shoulder its responsibilities in a better way
8384113 we still need to get done with all the necessary reforms when everything is ready parliament will ratify the law and the reforms in one session
8384114 j ouvi isso v rias vezes muita gente reclama porque ele falha 1 ano depois
8384115 some right wing prisoners found out i was in gaza and i think they wanted to lynch me
8384116 once again this government has shown that its words and commitments are meaningless and they have no intention of keeping to their word
8384117 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to process
8384118 the united states will not let these activities have any effect on final status negotiations including final borders
8384119 this has cost me about 25 000 and i am more fortunate than other farmers as ive been able to continue supporting my family by working as a teacher not all farmers have been able to continue a livelihood
8384120 israel has stolen thousands of dunams one tenth of a hectare of land from the palestinians
8384121 the settlers on the other hand benefit from all rights given to citizens of israel who live inside the green line and in some instances even additional rights
8384122 despu s del 2005 cuando sopla un hurac n la gente tiende a prepararse para lo peor es una situaci n en la que simplemente no quieres ser el tipo al que lo toma corto
8384123 the floor will be raised so that theres no direct contact with the drain ever at any point on the pool floor
8384124 it basically makes the drain unblockable which was the whole point of the law
8384125 i have these things on order and all of a sudden my supplier calls and says the cpsc has basically told them they should stop putting these in
8384126 so now these customers are saying what are we supposed to do
8384127 there are some issues in here and now where products might not be available but we are confident that as we move into september and october new products will come to market
8384128 the issue will be how quickly can these pool operators turn on a dime and purchase the products and have them installed
8384129 isnt clear whether those newly manufactured drain covers will meet requirements of either the federal or state law
8384130 have nice summer how was your summer have a nice sukkos how was your sukkos
8384131 si quiere contribuir al proceso de crecimiento y transformaci n que vive la argentina deber a por lo pronto colaborar cumpliendo aquello que ha prometido que es retirarse de la pol tica y dejar que nuevos actores que son los que hoy gobiernan tomen las decisiones que tengan que tomar
8384132 no creo que alguien aporte sugiriendo cambios de gabinete cuando l bien sabe que quien decide los cambios es la presidenta de la naci n
8384133 no se habl de acuerdo ni de las elecciones de 2009 ni de las del 2011 ni del gobierno de cristina fern ndez
8384134 estamos totalmente convencidos que mauricio macri si hace una buena gesti n y cumple con los vecinos es un firme candidato para las presidenciales 2011 y estamos trabajando en eso
8384135 expuso sobre lo que fund el movimiento productivo argentino hizo un paneo general de lo que est pasando cont su reciente viaje en brasil y hablamos de la capital federal

8384141 kinsella has crafted a handy little guide for politicos and non politicos alike just keep it away from the kids

8384144 hes canadas james carville a must read if you really want to win you need this book
8384145 he is allowed to express his political views on his personal vehicle but not on city owned property
8384146 as duas equipes s o perigosas recentemente ganhamos da hakedal torlen por 2 a 1 na r ssia e a maaseide glesnes jogaram muito bem surpreenderam nas olimp adas
8384147 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity

8384155 marked enlargement of his heart which had been failing for some time
8384156 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8384157 i dont like to dream where there is no room for dreaming and of course there could be some kind of exception in the future
8384158 but we cannot say that the european market at the level we are at right now is ready to afford this kind of challenge
8384159 if we are ready at some point to offer these amounts of money to the best players in the world then i will be the happiest man in the world but for me it is much more important to continue growing with stability and a solid base
8384160 but in the past few years weve had some offers that have been not of this level but close to this level
8384161 for me the problem would be if european teams go to a level of salaries that we cant fulfill that would be a problem weve been fortunate we have never had problems with paying players that would be one of the worst possible things
8384162 this is what is different for american people to understand
8384163 the difference in the system the difference in running the business over here in europe the owner falls in love with his own team he is entitled to do whatever he wants pour as much money as he wants into the team there is no cap no salary limit
8384164 its very difficult for american people to understand that you can go out and try to sign a player you fall in love with in the nba we talk about restrictions brought in by the salary cap and rules but here the owner dictates the philosophy of his club
8384165 i dont think there is a market to support this kind of deal in europe
8384166 now if lebron could go and play in china for a year that would be totally different
8384167 the only up and coming market in europe where it might make sense for companies to bankroll a deal could be russia
8384168 we are extremely pleased to report new all time record quarterly consolidated net sales operating income and net income in our fiscal 2008 third quarter results both our flight support and our electronic technologies groups reported record quarterly net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 with increases of 9 and 15 respectively over the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and year to date increases of 14 and 21 respectively over the first nine months of fiscal 2007 the sales increases within the flight support group and the electronic technologies group reflect organic growth as well as growth through acquiring profitable well managed businesses fiscal 2008 year to date organic revenue growth within each business segment approximated 10 when compared to net sales for the same period of fiscal 2007 operating income of our flight support group increased 15 to a record 20 4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 up from 17 8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and increased 19 to a record 59 7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 up from 50 1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 operating margins of the flight support group reflected a favorable product mix as margins improved to 18 5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 up from 17 7 for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and to 18 6 for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 up from 17 8 for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 operating income of our electronic technologies group increased 5 to a record 10 8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 up from 10 2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and increased 19 to a record 27 7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 up from 23 4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 as expected operating margins of the electronic technologies group were 28 6 for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and 26 2 in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 versus 31 3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and 26 8 in the first nine months of fiscal 2007 reflecting a less favorable product mix our consolidated operating margin improved to 18 7 for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 up from 18 0 for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and improved to 18 1 for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 up from 16 9 for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 principally reflecting increased gross profit margins we expect consolidated operating margins for the full fiscal 2008 year to approximate those experienced in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 totaled 56 6 million including 21 4 million generated in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 up from 37 3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 we are increasing our target for fiscal 2008 cash flow from operating activities to approximately 73 to 75 million an increase from our previous estimate of 70 million our capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 should approximate 14 to 16 million based on current market conditions we continue to target fiscal 2008 net sales and operating income growth over fiscal 2007 to approximate 13 and 21 respectively and diluted net income per share within a range of 1 75 to 1 78 these targets reflect the expected impact of capacity reductions announced by certain of our airline customers but exclude the impact of additional acquisitions if any as we look to the balance of fiscal 2008 and beyond we believe our commitment to develop new products and services our strong financial position and our ability to identify select acquisition opportunities provide the foundation for continued growth in sales and earnings we continue to significantly increase development of faa approved pma parts and continue to witness excellent market penetration by our comprehensive line of faa approved parts heico is the largest independent supplier of both faa approved engine and non engine pma parts although it appears possible that 2009 global air traffic growth may soften our focus on expanding the number of products and services offered to our customers will provide opportunity to grow sales and earnings in fiscal 2009 the company expects to provide our fiscal 2009 guidance at the time of our fourth quarter earnings release
8384169 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8384170 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8384171 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8384172 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8384173 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8384174 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8384175 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8384176 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8384177 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8384178 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8384179 if you look back 10 years ago the web was a very static place
8384180 fast forward and weve seen this amazing change in the web
8384181 finalizing the partnership was more of a formality something we had planned to do after seeing how powerful a tool it was for managing web sites
8384182 ektron has so many powerful features but the search engine is my favorite
8384183 google has taught people to search for what theyre looking for and its no different when people visit a web site if they dont find what theyre looking for they leave period ektrons built in search engine is the best ive seen in a cms and it will keep users on the web site and thats huge
8384184 vara software is a highly regarded award winning company that has been recognized by industry leaders such as apple inc
8384185 the ability to quickly capture live events create and distribute content for internet based content delivery is experiencing explosive growth
8384186 the growth of high speed internet connections around the world including in small and home offices makes it easier to access high quality video and audio content live or on demand
8384187 this has led to accelerated use of streaming media applications such as webcasting and screencasting we predict that increased broadband penetration will continue to be a key driver for these applications
8384188 i think that our schools are certainly up to standard
8384189 we review the refuge sites annually and we certainly work within our parameters to do the best we can
8384190 all the legislators want to know now is to get a good idea of how big an issue it is
8384191 if we were going to go with a consultant im not really sure where the money would come from
8384192 its 16 000 that well probably try to do in house with our own staff in order to save money
8384193 once ive seen the standards i would certainly want to go through the school and make sure that where were placing students meets the standards
8384194 im sure my butt is going to shrink but theres so much of it im not worried its going to go away
8384195 i want to dive into each theme and really become the character
8384196 it wasnt long before my character froze and i had to pull out
8384197 i wonder what possesses devs to release broken shit just to stick to a release date
8384198 why wouldnt they just push it back a week or so and fix it
8384199 surely the damaged reputation far outweighs some perceived advantage to releasing it on time
8384200 about three dozen demonstrators confronted people attending a human rights campaign concert at the fillmore auditorium tuesday night
8384201 theyre trying to appeal mainly to rich gay white men instead of the entire constituency they represent
8384202 god i am so sick of english speakers who think that they are representative
8384203 h1 tag this is also somewhere that you should place your keywords that you are targeting the h1 tag is basically the heading of your page search engines like google places good emphasis on this tag
8384204 h1 tags if you just do these two simple things then you will be halfway there to finishing your onsite seo work there are other stuff that you can do but these two are the most important
8384205 h1 tag then you can add that to your site and have one up on them powerful stuff

8384212 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
8384213 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
8384214 persecuted bullied threatened attacked or injured by others prior to the incident
8384215 bullying followed by a desire for revenge may therefore be a key dynamic behind many targeted school killings
8384216 without the desire for revenge its hard to imagine that troubled gang involved or gun obsessed teens would respond to bullying with lethal violence
8384217 ignore the desire for revenge and you miss a big part of the puzzle in many cases the biggest part
8384218 the desire for revenge isnt a disease to which certain unfortunate people fall prey
8384219 instead its a universal trait of human nature crafted by natural selection that exists today because it was adaptive in the ancestral environment in which the human species evolved
8384220 by creating the public perception that the nation had been victimized by unprovoked sneak attacks and that swift retaliatory action with overwhelmingly destructive force was the only rational and self interested course the country could take
8384221 served important functions for ancestral humans and its still capable of serving many of those important functions today
8384222 if we can better appreciate the naturalness of revenge the functions revenge arose to serve and the factors that elicit the motivation to seek revenge well be better equipped to change the world so that revenge becomes less destructive and less common
8384223 similar passions affections and emotions even the more complex ones such as jealousy suspicion emulation gratitude and magnanimity they practice deceit and are revengeful
8384224 the desire for revenge must have been effective in helping organisms to solve specific adaptive problems
8384225 today we may view revenge as a problem and it is but through the lens of evolution
8384226 this doesnt mean that the behavior is morally justified or that the tendency should be indulged
8384227 every employee manual should inform workers where they can go to complain when they are systematically harassed by a coworker or supervisor and human resources people need to look for resentful people carrying grudges
8384228 the capacity to forgive is every bit as authentic every bit as intrinsic to human nature and every bit as much a product of natural selection as is our penchant for revenge

8384247 the total weight of evidence from multiple studies conducted by investigators from different disciplines and using data from many countries demonstrates a causal relationship between tobacco advertising and promotion and increased tobacco use

8384266 people around the prime minister are now talking about shifting away from the speculation and talk of if and when and theyre now talking about what the issues should be they believe economic stewardship in difficult times will be a key issue
8384267 theyve already started to signal that change so we dont even have to say anymore expect an election call its definitely coming
8384268 you dont need to be a rocket scientist to read these tea leaves
8384269 i think the prime ministers intentions are painfully obvious despite the fact he was the one who introduced the bill that said wed have a fixed election date so stranger and stranger but yes im sure the party is ready and we all have work to do
8384270 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect upon
8384271 its not a question of wanting to go to an election its the reality
8384272 he wants to go to an election before canadians see he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the economy
8384273 he said the fixed election law only applies to majority governments the next election is scheduled for oct 19 2009 according to the law his government passed
8384274 micro managing dont tell them anything i am the ruler and you are the subordinate so you say as i do
8384275 he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the economy
8384276 we do have the ndp maybe they should finally have a chance to govern the country
8384277 well its not my fault the liberals ndp etc voted on the non confidence motion and its their fault were going to the polls
8384278 take a good look because its the last time youll see these
8384279 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8384280 it gives the government a fresh mandate that will give the government another couple of years to proceed
8384281 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8384282 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8384283 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8384284 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8384285 he doesnt like being at the mercy of others he likes to be in control of what hes doing
8384286 i suspect that theres some pretty strong or in depth party polls that are riding by riding that are persuading him that his chances are pretty good right now
8384287 i used to play a lot but i still get out there once or twice a week
8384288 i like to play hit some good shots hit some bad shots

8384298 we recognize that the claim detailed in the presentation by the researcher about bitlocker is correct
8384299 this theoretical attack is only possible in targeted situations and while probable its very unlikely
8384300 like all full volume encryption products bitlocker has a key in memory when the system is running in order to encrypt decrypt data on the fly for the drive s in use
8384301 if a system is in sleep mode it is in effect still running
8384302 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8384303 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8384304 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8384305 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits

8384312 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8384313 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8384314 must provide the definition of enemy combatant upon which it relies

8384323 this has been an extremely spirited and hard fought primary and now it appears as if we wont know the results until sometime wednesday at the earliest
8384324 im confident the final results will give us a primary victory and we can move on to the general election
8384325 thats not what law enforcement was doing at my office today
8384326 they werent telling us anything about the university of tennessee or the body farm or whatever theyre calling it nowadays so i really cant comment on that thats a leak and i certainly dont know where its coming from the one thing i can comment on is that they havent found caylee

8384328 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8384329 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8384330 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8384331 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8384332 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8384333 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8384334 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
8384335 fire your computer guy for the first time i am about to reveal exactly the same information i routinely charge my clients hundreds even thousands of dollars for
8384336 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8384337 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season

8384340 it rained every day but i got the job done now i feel very confident in trying to win this event
8384341 my goal is to win and try to forget about everything else and what it all means
8384342 y ouve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x you agree with everything that he stands for but you have some real doubts about his experience candidate y only believes in half the things but you really trust his experience who you gonna vote for
8384343 he said y ouve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x you agree with everything that he stands for but you have some real doubts about his experience candidate y only believes in half the things but you really trust his experience who you gonna vote for i mean thats what he said in denver
8384344 ensuring democracy delivers real dividends a perspective from former presidents and prime ministers
8384345 now in fairness he went on to say perhaps mindful of how his off the cuff remarks might have been taken this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8384346 its pretty hard to believe it doesnt have anything to do with whats going on now
8384347 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8384348 in march or april 2007 three noncommissioned united states army officers including a first sergeant a platoon sergeant and a senior medic killed four iraqi prisoners with pistol shots to the head as the men stood handcuffed and blindfolded beside a baghdad canal two of the soldiers said in sworn statements

8384351 with that screechy fingernails on the blackboard voice of hers it is impossible for hillary clinton to deliver a great speech
8384352 theyre not behind sen barack obama theyre hoping he falls flat on his face so the hilldebeest can have another run in four years and billy bentpecker can hide behind the curtain in the oval office telling hillary what he wants her to do as president of the united states thats what they really want and bill cant control himself
8384353 we are very fortunate the town is behind us and supports us in every endeavor we take on
8384354 one will be used for outside calls it will service our lsd area and be used for mutual aid calls and the other will be in town all the time
8384355 this new truck will service the community for the next 25 years very well
8384356 ghana being a tropical country the effect of climate change can be twofold
8384357 it can result in prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns in which case there can be years of too much rain too much rain than expected or less than expected in certain parts of the country as happened in the northern part of the country last year we had so much rain and flooding that had not been experienced in decades
8384358 the problem with deforestation is largely to blame on the government
8384359 that is the government is not committed to some of the basic rules that it itself has put in place to regulate or to ensure that forest is conserved one is the issue that the government is not able to control what we call the annual allocation of companies in timber processing so because government can not monitor people are always cutting beyond what we call the annual allowable cut
8384360 its slow very slow the price is down and the catches are poor that just about sums it up were only two weeks into it but the start for everybody has been down from last year
8384361 in this area we have a gentlemans agreement that no one will fish on sunday and everyone abides by that agreement i know they fish in areas north of us but we dont start until monday
8384362 were still seeing some good signs that theres lobster in the strait were seeing lots of little ones on the bottom
8384363 its going to take a lot of years for that to right itself
8384364 theres a specific measure for female lobster and any females over that size have to be put back in the water they say thats going to help increase the number of lobsters but im not sure if that really works
8384365 they raised the measure they went to a market sized lobster fishery only they throw all of the juveniles back instead of landing all of these canner lobsters like we do here
8384366 somebody i will never know who covered my fees as i simply went to the rink and said i would like to play
8384367 i decided that if i could ever afford it i would like to ensure that nobody would ever miss out on the opportunity to participate the minute i reached that point i decided to come back and do what i could do
8384368 we will use the money for a variety of purposes but all to improve the long term health of hockey in sackville
8384369 first we will be able to send our coaches for upgrading and then our minor officials will have their qualifications upgraded we will also use the resources to ensure that our elite players will attend summer hockey camps and those unable to cover the costs will be cared for

8384377 diese u ern sich in schlafst rungen wutausbr chen und emotionaler stumpfheit
8384378 es ist wie so ein veteranentreffen menschen die etwas gemeinsam erlebt haben und sich treffen bauen eine bindung zueinander auf
8384379 dass die ganze katastrophe nach wie vor politisch nicht aufgearbeitet ist
8384380 schalen geschmack dass sich hier aus der verantwortung herausgewunden wurde
8384381 es gibt viele fragen die offen bleiben die einen umtreiben und nicht abschlie en lassen
8384382 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8384383 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8384384 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8384385 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8384386 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8384387 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8384388 teach yourself human anatomy and physiology visually in 24 hours
8384389 john mccain says hes a maverick but hes voted with bush over 90 of the time
8384390 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev thats what reagan did with gorbachev thats what nixon did with mao
8384391 the bottom line is he has to come to the negotiating table and negotiate with the mdc as representatives of the people of the country to find a way forward
8384392 they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating and that in six months time the government will collapse i do not know when that day will come i wish main opposition leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8384393 but unfortunately he is a driver who is so determined to crash the vehicle hes trying to take us into a ditch
8384394 das kann man eigentlich gar nicht begreifen was da passiert ist
8384395 ich habe es eigentlich schon immer gewusst aber mir wurde immer gesagt dass carmen und nadine mich bald besuchen w rden dass es ihnen gut gehe
8384396 so hart diese nachricht war es war auch irgendwie eine erleichterung endlich zu wissen was mit ihnen ist
8384397 die k rperliche arbeit ist einfach zu viel f r mich
8384398 das war wie einzelhaft und folter zusammen ich wollte nur noch was haben damit es endlich vorbei ist
8384399 fr her hatte ich pl ne was ich im n chsten jahr machen wollte heute mache ich keine langfristigen pl ne mehr sondern lebe jeden tag neu und bewusst
8384400 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8384401 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8384402 does not weaken a key competitor in the fashion doll category where barbies market share has contracted
8384403 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8384404 the presently accepted regenerative medicine idea is that you make a stem cell from a patient bring it back to the beginning as it were then you are left with the problem of how to instruct that cell to become a beta cell or a motor neuron
8384405 we asked the simple question why should you have to go all the way back to the beginning could you go from one cell type to another
8384406 up to this time we hadnt demonstrated that you could do direct reprogramming
8384407 one present treatment for some diabetics is to transplant islets into the liver so we know that liver cells are a reasonable home for beta cells
8384408 if were lucky in two to five years we can think about doing that in people
8384409 if we physically inject something into the pancreas it almost always induces pancreatitis
8384410 you could be causing more trouble than what you started with
8384411 maybe when the history of the whole subject is written it will be possible to say which was the best idea
8384412 i cant emphasize enough at this point that were too ignorant to know what is the best way to treat patients and until we know that it is essential that we use embryonic stem cells and ips cells to teach us about the mechanisms of disease until we know how to succeed we have to aggressively pursue all avenues
8384413 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8384414 wir haben uns erst vier wochen sp ter gefunden waren vor bergehend getrennt das war im chaos so

8384416 in the fourth quarter we should see a bump up
8384417 the government is really focused on helping the lower income level of the population
8384418 we turned cautious in the second half of last year
8384419 i think we are going to see a change in attitude
8384420 in past months the central government had the attitude that it needed to control inflation and keep the economy from overheating
8384421 we are seeing the central government signal that it is going to be more focused on economic growth
8384422 weve reached a point where consumers no longer want to frequent hotels and resorts that arent embracing green business practices
8384423 our mission is to reduce non biodegradable card waste to zero during the convention and throughout the year by encouraging the use of our eco friendly wood cards in every hotel in america
8384424 der stark negative trend w hrend der sommerzeit im vergangenen jahrzehnt setzt sich fort
8384425 and thats before they know about his position on choice and that hes against equal pay
8384426 the development on the out of touch argument is an actually critical development of the campaign
8384427 s ome of the voters images of mccain dont jibe with reality
8384428 the gallup daily is the worst thing thats happened in journalism in 20 years
8384429 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process
8384430 they could then secede from the united states and then we might have another civil war
8384431 they have an allegiance to mexico where they were taught the u s fought an unjust war with mexico and took this territory
8384432 they believe the territory of these states belongs to mexico

8384434 while riding the course i kept thinking to myself that we must be on the wrong road there is just simply no way a time trial would have this much climbing
8384435 at the reassurance from my coach and much to my delight we were on the right course
8384436 i was then able to trace the entire course from the comfort of my home and find a similar route to train on back in boise
8384437 this capability along with having the elevation profile proved invaluable in my preparation for my gold medal race
8384438 here at the top model institute of technology we 21 questions the new york questionnaire
8384439 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8384440 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work
8384441 if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8384442 we test almost everything even things that you would think are so small that we could not possibly care nor could they possibly matter in fact small changes do matter and we do care
8384443 google has gone from innovative upstart to fat and happy industry leader in what seems like record time

8384461 larrabee hasnt shipped so you dont know what it is and i dont know what it is
8384462 by the time it does ship nvidias technology will be so far advanced it wont matter
8384463 thats the way its been predominantly a lot of the time
8384464 i think they kind of skip over me i like that because its less pressure for me we just do the best we can stay under the radar i guess and see what we can do
8384465 we still just havent got the chemistry between he and the crew chief and the team that we rebuilt to be where its at its absolute best but theyre very close to being able to do the deal
8384466 if we could just win a race and get that behind us i think everybody would be a little bit more relaxed
8384467 the reason he hasnt won is just because we havent had our cars fast enough but hes been close
8384468 he should have won two or three times this year maybe he can be a contender for a championship and have the best part of his year after the chase starts
8384469 it was a long green run day and i ran third the rest of the day
8384470 but a lap down third and every time the caution would come out the leaders were passing lapped cars again and i never got the lucky dog
8384471 i finished 20th and we ended up losing the championship by 35 points all we needed was a top 10 there and i had the championship won
8384472 thats kind of sore i guess but hopefully it wont happen this year if we get in
8384473 youve got to put yourself in that position to be able to win a race
8384474 youre not going to win from running 20th youre going to be in position running in the top five
8384475 but it just really made sense for my team to come back to the papermill area to work for smith barney and to put these two teams together and unfortunately cy passed away before he could see it it was part of his dream as well
8384476 its not unusual for advisers to move from firm to firm as this is a competitive industry

8384514 one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of americas withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like boat people re education camps and killing fields
8384515 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8384516 come on america change the channel from mtv vh1 and all those terrible shows that you love to watch and turn on the news
8384517 you republicans are so happy because you or your parents gave valuable opportunities to better your situations whether financial or otherwise and now you hug
8384518 if images of that sort persuade you to vote for a candidate like obama then you need to re evaluate your citizenship to this country
8384519 i do not respect your stand on war you did not so object when clinton fought the fearsome bosnias or the terrible hatians or those world dominators in mogadishu hypocrites thus your position is partisan trash not moraled principal

8384528 you re john mccain the republican candidate for president and you want to fix the countrys problems even though you don t know much about the economy you mccain don t know how to use the internet you mccain don t know how many houses you own or what kind of car you drive you mccain admit you don t think clearly when you re tired you mccain make frequent gaffes on foreign policy you mccain think offshore drilling is a short term solution to high gas prices you mccain support torture and keeping the guantanamo prison open you mccain make rash decisions and statements from which you have to quickly backtrack you mccain have an explosive temper on a hair trigger your idea of health care reform mccain is wear more sunscreen youre for stem cell research mccain except when its done on stem cells because you consider them all american citizens and you mccain voted to support the policies of the worst president ever bush 100 percent of the time this year

8384530 whether it is the thawing of the northwest passage or the suspected resource riches under the arctic seabed more and more countries are taking an interest in the waterways of the canadian arctic
8384531 we will be sending a clear message to the world that our environmental standards and sovereignty are not up for debate if you are in canadas arctic you will be playing by canadas rules
8384532 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction

8384545 they are the sort of people who say that they are 100 per cent committed to the environment at home

8384547 ghana being a tropical country the effect of climate change can be twofold
8384548 it can result in prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns in which case there can be years of too much rain too much rain than expected or less than expected in certain parts of the country as happened in the northern part of the country last year we had so much rain and flooding that had not been experienced in decades
8384549 the problem with deforestation is largely to blame on the government
8384550 that is the government is not committed to some of the basic rules that it itself has put in place to regulate or to ensure that forest is conserved one is the issue that the government is not able to control what we call the annual allocation of companies in timber processing so because government can not monitor people are always cutting beyond what we call the annual allowable cut
8384551 dont panic we have nothing to fear from an aging society
8384552 there would be only two persons of working age for every person aged 65 or more in 2060 compared with four persons to one today
8384553 one of the major challenges europe must face with climate change and globalization
8384554 the consequences of the aging population poses a greater threat to the national economy than climate change
8384555 its not as sexy a subject as climate change so this subject gets shoved off into the corner but its economic consequences are enormous and were calling on the government and the opposition to give the priority in a bipartisan way which will enable australia to avoid going bankrupt
8384556 i am so tired of the laziness of reporters who constantly trot out the common wisdom
8384557 like it or not the chinese solution to population control is no longer to be dismissed by the rest of the world
8384558 it was stressed that the deal should include the entire issues without any exception and without any partial or interim agreements
8384559 the offer to chuck was that it was only to replace financial considerations he might lose during an election

8384562 i dont know what kind of beetle that is what do you think we should call it
8384563 it has spots and it runs fast lets call it speedy spotty beetle

8384565 do you hear that sound lets see if we can find where its coming from
8384566 you found an animal track where do you think the animal was going did it have big feet or small ones was it walking or hopping what do your tracks look like when you walk and when you hop

8384568 speaking to key leadership personalities and assessing them is critical to what happens inside adhamiyah
8384569 it is a lot of people management we spend a lot of the day walking on the street to get a picture from the locals we sit down with the key leaders and from there it is a question of co ordinating them
8384570 i think that the government will come after us and there will be chaos
8384571 they dont come to hurt us and we dont go to their place
8384572 all of them are from the shia militia the mehdi army
8384573 they are dangerous we dont go there and they dont come to us
8384574 back there there was a wall that they had painted
8384575 over here on the left and right of the road you can see that it is pretty torn up what they are trying to do is lay cables to try to get the infrastructure back
8384576 for the last three days we have not electricity in this area
8384577 the people who are in charge of the area are thieves
8384578 all around peshawar on every side the situation is volatile because of the people coming from bajaur bara dera adam khel and the people from swat and waziristan
8384579 all of this is impacting the infrastructure in peshawar the schools the health system everything is overloaded
8384580 we had no idea it was going to happen the government didnt tell us anything and we didnt see them anywhere
8384581 we are doing what we can to support the people here
8384582 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling
8384583 in missouri and other battleground states republican ads say i would raise taxes but my plan would provide three times more tax relief to the middle class
8384584 i dont think people realize that and i hope that message will be absorbed by the electorate

8384602 garbled sci fi yarn a vision of the future awash with dystopian clich s the relationship between all three protagonists is distant and disinterested the fights are competent rather than exhilarating which is a problem given the incoherence of the narrative caps the story with a flat climax and a bewildering coda
8384603 im very unhappy with the film i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience its pure violence and stupidity the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24 fox was sending lawyers who were only looking at all the commas and the dots they made everything difficult from a to z
8384604 i like the energy of it and i got some scenes im happy with but i had something much better in my hands i just wasnt allowed to work i dont see how people who went through all these amazing blockbusters like the dark knight and iron man this summer will take it i should have chosen a studio that has guts fox was just trying to get a pg 13 movie im ready to go to war against them but i cant because they dont give a s t
8384605 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8384606 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8384607 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8384608 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8384609 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8384610 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8384611 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence

8384707 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8384708 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8384709 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy

8384822 we went back to what glen loved and what people loved about glen i really wanted to make a record that sounded like those 60 songs
8384823 when i heard those songs for the first time they sounded hip to me and then later i noticed the lyrics were completely different i didnt realize galveston was about vietnam those songs lyrically were way ahead of the pack especially for the era when they were written
8384824 i said the only idea i have is glen campbell

8384828 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8384829 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8384830 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8384831 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8384832 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8384833 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8384834 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8384835 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8384836 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8384837 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8384838 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8384839 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8384840 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8384845 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part

8384852 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8384853 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8384854 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8384855 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8384856 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8384857 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8384858 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8384859 no one works for someone we all just work together
8384860 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8384861 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8384862 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8384863 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8384864 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8384865 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8384866 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8384867 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8384868 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8384869 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8384870 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8384871 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8384872 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period

8384877 dell is doing the most aggressive things possible to optimize for cloud computing
8384878 we think dell is perhaps the furthest along and we see them as a thought leader
8384879 what we have seen in the landscape is that most server providers are trying to provide lexus quality products at a toyota price we are looking for scion products at a scion price
8384880 vendors have to be creative around power and airflow optimization the cost of operating the hardware is key you have to take down the operating cost not just the server cost

8384887 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8384888 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8384889 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8384890 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8384891 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8384892 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8384893 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8384894 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8384895 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8384896 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8384897 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8384898 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8384899 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8384900 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8384901 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8384902 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8384903 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8384904 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8384905 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8384906 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8384907 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8384908 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8384909 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8384910 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8384911 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8384912 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8384913 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8384914 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8384915 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8384916 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8384917 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8384918 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8384919 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8384920 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8384921 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8384922 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8384923 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8384924 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8384925 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8384926 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8384927 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8384928 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8384929 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8384930 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8384931 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8384932 i have heretofore suggested that this peculiarity high alcohol and less acid might in a measure be modified by not allowing the grape to become as dead ripe as is usually done this would tend to increase the acid at the expense of the sugar which is in excess at best thus producing the excessive headiness for which california wines are thus far noted the vintners object to this course on the ground of the european precedent according to which every additional day of sun is accounted so much gain to the quality of the wine but what is true in the cloudy climate of europe is not therefore necessarily true in sunny california
8384933 a hundred years to find out where these vines should be planted in california

8384938 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services
8384939 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8384940 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8384941 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8384942 technology for the web sites overall is still developing and there would need to be some flexibility in those standards
8384943 standards should not be dictated by any particular individual it needs to be a collaborative process

8384949 i have an arcade of live oaks on some land i own in the country and to me those oaks are living art their roots have been in that soil for 250 years their newest shoots came out last spring roots of tradition shoots of growth both in balance it seems to me that health for an individual or a community or a nation is found in achieving that delicate balance between continuity and change

8384955 they were getting paid as little as 5s an hour when they should be getting 7 15
8384956 basically they were usually getting paid a weekly rate no matter how many hours they worked
8384957 were going to be by the end of this investigation presenting every trainer with a bill as how much he owes the workers hes underpaid

8384965 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8384966 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8384967 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8384971 unser ziel war es den platz vor der insel zu blockieren und den dort geplanten rechten aufmarsch zu verhindern
8384972 gut dass die stadt trotz der sehr kurzen vorbereitungszeit pr sent war und flagge gezeigt hat
8384973 sie propagieren einen nationalen sozialismus ohne zu wissen was damals gewesen ist
8384974 aber trotzdem bin ich froh dar ber jetzt hier zu stehen
8384975 dieser aufmarsch in suhl schockiert mich aber er berrascht mich leider nicht
8384976 das thema wird uns wohl noch l nger besch ftigen
8384977 es handelte sich um 17 19 und 23 jahre alte deutsche ausl ndischer abstammung die zum teil in suhl nord wohnen
8384978 nach der ersten vernehmung und entlassung aus dem polizeigewahrsam begaben sich die gleichen t ter gegen 5 uhr in die rettungsstelle des klinikums und schlugen dort nochmals auf den auf rztliche versorgung wartenden 27 j hrigen ein

8384980 man kann als b rgermeister nicht nur die eigenen parteifreunde informieren und andere fraktionen au en vor lassen

8384982 ich bedanke mich bei allen mitgliedern des b ndnisses sowie den unterst tzern die an diesem abend durch ihr beherztes einschreiten eine kundgebung der jungen nationaldemokraten auf dem platz vor dem familienzentrum die insel verhindert haben
8384983 dabei ist es gleich von wem und welcher seite diese ausgehen wer auch immer diese ver bt straft ter ob deutsche oder ausl nder m ssen zur rechenschaft gezogen werden und zwar auf dem wege des gesetzes nicht mit parolen wie sie am sonntagabend in suhl nord von rechten demonstranten zu h ren waren
8384984 dass er meine person und die meines gro vaters f r seine naziparolen missbraucht hat ist ungeheuerlich
8384985 neonazis wie hoppe scheuen noch nicht einmal davor zur ck das andenken eines solchen antifaschisten in den schmutz zu ziehen dessen leben f r mich verm chtnis ist schlimm nur dass ihm wie uns w hrend der kundgebung schmerzlich bewusst wurde so viele junge menschen auf den leim gehen

8385142 o jovem vai se tornar usu rio a partir do momento em que ele tem problemas com os pais amigos col gio e at consigo mesmo os pais deveriam conversar mais com os filhos desde pequenos para terem informa o e forma o para passar sobre as barreiras das drogas
8385143 os jovens de hoje em dia t m uma liberdade muito grande e isso ajuda os adolescents a entrarem nesse grande mundod as drogas
8385144 geralmente os jovens entram no mundod as drogas para se autoafirmar por problemas de fam lia falta de personbalidade ou at mesmo curiosidade
8385145 alguns jovens procuram a droga pois se sentem solit rios ou procuram a droga para se esconder dos pr prios problemas acham que a droga vai defen lo de algo mas s traz problemas
8385146 por que os jovens usam drogas porque teve problema com a fam lia por querer sentir algo diferente
8385147 conhe o muitas pessoas que usam drogas pra chamar a aten o dos pais
8385148 n o sou usu ria mas tenho v rios amigos que usam o que est em quest o o desafio aos pais entrei na do cigarro e j s o uns quatro anos de depend ncia se eu n o tive cabe a para entrar nessa imagine agora para sair
8385149 muitos jovens por terem curiosidade como todos temos acabam entrando numa fria e depois dificilmente conseguem sair do v cio
8385150 na minha opini o a primeira coisa que fascina os jovens a respeito das drogas a curiosidade de uma coisa nova a novidade desperta uma curiosidade enorme principalmente nas pessoas menos informadas que n o sabem seus males
8385151 alguns jovens come am a ser usu rios de drogas por curiosidade pois muita gente usa e fala que muito bom essa curiosidade faz o jovem experimentar pois f cil adquirir drogas hoje em dia
8385152 acho que h jovens que usam drogas para chamar a aten o par se mostrarem aos outros pensando que porque usam drogas s o mais evolu dos que os outros jovens
8385153 muitos jovens experimentam drogas por influ ncia dos outros alguns pra se achar o descolado da turma e muitas vezes eles acabam em cl nicas
8385154 acho que jovens usam drogas por press o dos amigos drogados
8385155 um dos problemas mais comuns entre os jovens a falta de personalidade e a facilidade com que s o induzidos a determinadas atitudes na minha opini o um usu rio de drogas n o tem cabe a como dizem opini o pr pria e levado a esse mundo principalmente por grupos de amigos

8385233 it can result in prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns in which case there can be years of too much rain too much rain than expected or less than expected in certain parts of the country as happened in the northern part of the country last year we had so much rain and flooding that had not been experienced in decades
8385234 the problem with deforestation is largely to blame on the government
8385235 that is the government is not committed to some of the basic rules that it itself has put in place to regulate or to ensure that forest is conserved one is the issue that the government is not able to control what we call the annual allocation of companies in timber processing so because government can not monitor people are always cutting beyond what we call the annual allowable cut

8385349 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8385350 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8385351 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8385352 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8385353 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8385354 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8385355 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8385356 the next six months are going to tell the story
8385357 el entendimiento pasa por un di logo honesto sincero y responsable con ganas de solucionar el problema
8385358 si va haber di logo que sea de verdad porque as lo ha pedido el pueblo y desea que haya entendimiento para que podamos tener un poco de tranquilidad y seguir progresando

8385362 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years

8385368 you have to realize that its a long long season
8385369 you tell yourself that last year there were something like 64 different quarterbacks who started in the nfl
8385370 so you know going into the season theres a good chance that at some point youre going to play
8385371 there is obviously going to be a blackout sometime this season unless the chefs give their tickets away which will just anger everyone else who is getting ripped off in the stadium jay feeley is was our biggest offseason pickup and we are 35 million under the cap i guess we couldnt afford to keep jared allen though sheesh its going to be a looong season fire the power and hire bill cowher
8385372 cool stuff making modern games look like theyre on original game gameboy
8385373 i look at this region and i see a great parallel to ireland
8385374 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
8385375 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves
8385376 la construction de colonies isra liennes est un probl me
8385377 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
8385378 um aumento das chuvas que ser o fortes nas prov ncias do leste especialmente nas zonas montanhosas e na costa sul com risco de inunda es e desprendimentos de terra
8385379 haver fortes ressacas em ambas as costas do leste com poss veis inunda es na cidade de baracoa
8385380 the real problem is those who were open minded towards mr obama but who now fear he may not be up to it and they are not hard to find in denver
8385381 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8385382 i want you to know that this has been a joy yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8385383 please help me get divorce next time he will kill me he injured me with a knife
8385384 it can be a little confusing if youre not used to it
8385385 the match in vadodara will feature all the probables for the test series against australia
8385386 we would like to use that time to get our best players to play in domestic cricket and prepare in the best manner possible for the very important series against australia
8385387 what we are also planning at this stage is to organise a comprehensive camp for our players ahead of that series
8385388 we are also keen to have the mohammad nissar trophy on september 15 in delhi between the domestic champions of india and pakistan too there is also the important series two tests between india a and australia a starting in bangalore on september 3 we would like to focus on these events and i dont think anything else is possible
8385389 pakistan sri lanka and south africa have confirmed for a quadrangular one day tournament in south africa while india australia or new zealand will most likely be filling in the final spot
8385390 the match in vadodara will feature all the probables for the test series against australia

8385397 n o importa onde estejamos ao final da temporada do degelo a not cia s refor a esta no o de que o gelo rtico est em sua espiral de morte
8385398 indicates that the american public considers presumed republican presidential nominee john mccain better than obama on terrorism and iraq and voters consider mccain a stronger leader who would have better judgment in an international crisis
8385399 the iraq surge was ill conceived because it was simply tactical without an overall national security strategy
8385400 a sense of trust in the candidate to be commander in chief is important
8385401 ive seen obama under a great amount of pressure and ive never seen obama lose his temper and balance
8385402 obamas position is that he wants people to disagree with him so he can understand their perspective
8385403 mccain often arrives at views too quickly digs in very deeply and this quality is very destructive
8385404 the most important thing a person possesses is their imagination
8385405 continua sendo do tesouro mas uma parte dos recursos poderia vir do pr sal
8385406 n s estamos trabalhando para que parte dos recursos do pr sal v para a previd ncia rural
8385407 enquanto a previd ncia urbana arrecadou at julho 12 8 bilh es de reais para pagamento de benef cios de 12 3 bilh es de reais a rural arrecadou 426 milh es de reais para pagar benef cios de 3 bilh es de reais
8385408 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8385409 i want you to know that this has been a joy yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8385410 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8385411 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8385412 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8385413 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8385414 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8385415 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8385416 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8385417 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8385418 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8385419 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8385420 this is the master bedroom located in the northeast corner of the house
8385421 notice the king size bed which is dressed in an expensive down comforter by ralph lauren and topped with dozens of designer pillows
8385422 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8385423 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent
8385424 right now we are holding a majority by the skin of joe liebermans teeth
8385425 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8385426 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8385427 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8385428 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8385429 people always ask me whats your biggest criticism of president bush im sure you all have your own heres mine its not just the policy differences its the fact that hits president never tapped into our greatest resources the character and resolve of the american people
8385430 john mccain promises more of the same a plan that would explode the deficit and leave it to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8385431 for mark warner it was well delivered in a grand venue but it certainly was not what the audience wanted or what the democratic convention needed
8385432 a mild slap acknowledging that there are some differences and he kept very much in mind that he is a candidate himself hes not elected
8385433 in this global economy if you can send a job to bangalore india you can sure as heck send one to danville va and flint mi and scranton pa and peoria il
8385434 when i because governor this is what virginia faced a massive budget shortfall an economy that wasnt moving gridlock in the capital sound familiar
8385435 now this was a direct shot at his opponent jim gilmore right
8385436 absolutely and what he doesnt go on to explain is that how did i get out of that particular mess well yes bipartisan but i also went out and raised taxes
8385437 a lot of the national commentators are saying including mark halperin with time magazine is saying this speech ranked a
8385438 sales have dropped significantly and the number of indisposed properties increases drastically in the past three months the drop is of 30 40 for the external market and 5 for the domestic while forecasts say that it will continue until the end of the year early 2009
8385439 comparatively paphos had the highest prices today property prices show a drastic decrease of up to 30 or even 50 for flats
8385440 the future of the property market is gloomy due to the slowdown in the number of sales across cyprus the commercial plots and land are exempted since the demand by foreign investors russians mostly who want to expand their business activities to the island is big
8385441 the interest rate increase which pushes monthly installments up is the main reason for the drop in domestic demand which will continue in the next few months
8385442 if the crisis goes on lending will become more difficult for other professional groups too such as hoteliers and traders
8385443 comparatively paphos had the highest prices today property prices show a drastic decrease of up to 30 or even 50 for flats
8385444 the way i see it the real long term problem facing markets with significant amounts of holiday properties is going to rear its head when retiring baby boomers start dying off lots of people croaking plus very few in a position to buy their second homes potential problems worthy of further analysis
8385445 its wonderful to see all of you so i could thank you
8385446 this has been a joy yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8385447 it is traditional that we have nominations that we have a roll call we have candidates that look for ways to work so we come out of here to win in november i come here today to release you as my delegates
8385448 what that means is that both senator obamas name and mine will be put into nomination this afternoon i have spoken to many of you who have expressed your questions about what you should do many of you feel a responsibility to represent your voters others of you want the chance to vote whats in your heart still others will be voting for senator obama because they want to demonstrate their commitment to the party and the nomninee so i am not telling you what to do
8385449 what is important to come out of today is that we nominate senator barack obama and joe biden for the president and vice president of the united states
8385450 the horizontal world growing up wild in the middle of nowhere
8385451 wild nights stories about the last days of poe dickinson twain james and hemmingway
8385452 my sister my love the intimate story of skyler rampike
8385453 straight from the source an expos from the former editor in chief of the hip hop bible
8385454 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8385455 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8385456 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8385457 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8385458 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8385459 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8385460 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8385461 encourage users to analyze comment on and even challenge washingtonpost coms articles
8385462 everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler
8385463 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
8385464 we would have an immigration policy that brings 12 million people out of the shadows
8385465 we all know our countrys journey toward equality isnt finished yet we have more work to do
8385466 hes our story he has walked in our shoes and he has walked our mile
8385467 you wouldnt want anyone pushing you to the ground and pulling down your pants so you shouldnt do it to other kids
8385468 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8385469 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8385470 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8385471 you know youre not actually going to make any sort of perceptible difference right i mean sure if you want to hole yourself up in an office and study africans forever go ahead but youre work life is pretty much pointless
8385472 oh thats such good work you can do sooo much over there cant wait to see it you know i gave a check to that one aids relief fund just the other week let me go find their address i bet you can work with them
8385473 wow thats a huge area with a ton of problems i was reading about this one project that did have some success though i bet youll be able to have some small scale effect maybe that will spill over
8385474 this style is truly a masterpiece of design showing the juxtaposition of the elegant woman and the classy man
8385475 i believe that as democrats and americans united you are to be given the respect and recognition that you deserve as delegates
8385476 i have spoken to many of you and you have questions about what to do you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8385477 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8385478 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8385479 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8385480 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8385481 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8385482 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8385483 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8385484 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8385485 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8385486 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8385487 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8385488 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8385489 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8385490 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8385491 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8385492 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8385493 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8385494 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8385495 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8385496 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8385497 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8385498 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8385499 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8385500 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8385501 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8385502 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8385503 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8385504 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8385505 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8385506 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8385507 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8385508 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8385509 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8385510 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8385511 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8385512 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8385513 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8385514 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8385515 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8385516 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8385517 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8385518 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8385519 se tom fosse lossigeno e bill la sostanza che reagisce verrebbe un tomossido di bill ma bill ha due valenze e quindi avremo un tomossido billoso per la valenza minore e un tomossido billico per la valenza maggiore
8385520 s e quindi ti aspetti che i tokio hotel saltino giu dallelicottero
8385521 theres lots of warm water out there and the conditions are just right
8385522 the track of this is really a nasty one for cuba because it doesnt just pass through one spot
8385523 its tracking right on the south coast of cuba so they could be impacted all the way
8385524 its really just made me sick inside that something like this could happen
8385525 unfortunately it wasnt a case where we could pull or slide her out so we needed to use extrication equipment in order to remove the young lady from underneath the armored car
8385526 you realize how fragile life is when youre parked at a bus stop waiting for your child to get on a bus and something like this happens
8385527 the frustrating thing was to stand at the tape and not be able to get through and cuddle and protect your child
8385528 he has been our bus driver for a very long time i have three children i feel so secure with him picking up my children every morning
8385529 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8385530 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8385531 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8385532 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8385533 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8385534 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8385535 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8385536 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8385537 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8385538 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8385539 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8385540 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8385541 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8385542 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8385543 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8385544 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8385545 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8385546 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8385547 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8385548 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8385549 i am here today to release you as my delegates
8385550 what is so important is that at the end of today we will nominate barack obama and joe biden as the president and vice president of the united states
8385551 i want you to know this has been a joy yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8385552 i believe that as democrats and as americans we will leave denver united
8385553 he is the man i would call on at 3 00am
8385554 i fought a good fight but came up short and because we have a democratic process obama is our winner and i urge every last hillary supporter to become a obama supporter
8385555 mccain 2008 and claim to be hillary supporters disrespect her and everything she stands for everything she has fought for and everything she believes in
8385556 mccain 2008 hillary 2012 do not care about the families and the children who will need healthcare between 2008 and 2012
8385557 mccain 2008 are republicans there is no place for shortsighted hatred and a thirst for vengeance in the democratic party that is the drug that the republicans peddle
8385558 hillary i love you for the first time in my life i will be voting for a republican in november yes mccain looks much better capable trustworthy experienced and honorable than barack obama i will wait hillarys run in 2012 mccain 2008
8385559 she didnt make the case for obamas ability in international issues
8385560 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8385561 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8385562 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8385563 that should not take away from their great qualities as pioneers and doers
8385564 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
8385565 pickens is reaching that part of deep america thats usually not touched by the traditional environmental discourse
8385566 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8385567 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8385568 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8385569 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8385570 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8385571 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8385572 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8385573 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8385574 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8385575 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8385576 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8385577 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8385578 providing access to improved health and wellness with compassion and respect for all
8385579 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8385580 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8385581 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services
8385582 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8385583 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8385584 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8385585 technology for the web sites overall is still developing and there would need to be some flexibility in those standards
8385586 standards should not be dictated by any particular individual it needs to be a collaborative process
8385587 ahh d ska ni ha barn n sta april d
8385588 we arent going to turn away a new shooter by any means
8385589 i should point out that your family is in business with the coal industry you opposed a bill that wouldve stopped coal mines from exploding the tops of mountains and dumping waste into rivers there so shouldnt you temper on your opinion on the environment
8385590 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8385591 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8385592 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8385593 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8385594 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8385595 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8385596 hey you actually look like a healthy human with some color
8385597 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8385598 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8385599 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8385600 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8385601 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8385602 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8385603 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8385604 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8385605 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8385606 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8385607 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8385608 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8385609 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8385610 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8385611 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8385614 hurricane gustav tracking models are taking it into the western gulf with some tracks bearing down on louisiana what could be more challenging message wise going into the republican convention next week than new orleans being prepared for a category 2 or worse storm
8385615 these kinds of fractures are really serious but we have an excellent vet who surgically repaired it today
8385616 at least his life was saved and at least his wing was saved
8385617 but we grabbed him by his legs and that was it
8385618 he had a pretty severely broken wing but it looks like hes going to make it

8385621 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
8385622 we owe him gratitude for that but we dont owe him our vote the stakes are too high

8385626 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica
8385627 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato
8385628 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8385629 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8385630 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8385631 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti

8385636 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8385637 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8385638 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8385639 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato

8385643 it affected that whole community at valley regional very deeply
8385644 and karen said it would be great if someone could do a benefit
8385645 we took it from there and its been about a year in the works
8385646 then you find out that there is no treatment no way to reverse it and no one is ever cured i am okay with all that now
8385647 but it does get to me at times i hope they find a treatment and a cure so victims in the future dont have to experience all this

8385683 every week we have people come in that have heard about it from laurel hartington crofton sioux city le mars even kansas and new york
8385684 thats one of the things i admire about him hes a real spouse and he reacts the way a real spouse does
8385685 he didnt like when his wife was attacked and he responded accordingly and thats the way i hope my spouse would have reacted if i was attacked
8385686 hes got a lot of thoughts and hell come up with a lot of good things
8385687 mr clinton sought and often managed to convince americans that the global economy was an opportunity and not a threat
8385688 whatever his legacy from this campaign that legacy of his presidency should be built upon
8385689 hes sort of yesterdays man trying to be todays man and he seems angry about it
8385690 he doesnt seem to know what to do with himself and focused so much energy on his wifes campaign and when it didnt go their way he got quite nasty
8385691 this theory is false and is flatly rejected by president clintons doctors
8385692 numerous errors it is in short journalism of personal destruction at its worst
8385693 i think theres a good deal of evidence that he is quite a bit angrier than he used to be

8385700 this is obviously a temporary setback for our team but fortunately it is not something that is season ending

8385708 im not gonna take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton everyday
8385709 i think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics
8385710 nobody has spent more time over the last two years attacking democrats than keith olbermann and chris matthews and im just not going to get lectured on how to be a good democrat from them
8385711 and i wasnt gonna stand for it anymore ive spent my entire adult life working for democratic causes and candidates and im not gonna have my credentials challenged

8385720 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus

8385723 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8385724 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8385725 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8385726 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

8385833 he was a crucial supporter of the law in that he paved the way for other democrats to support it
8385834 senator biden provided a lot of political cover for the credit card industry because they wanted to show that the proposal had bipartisan support he aggressively undermined the opposition to the bill
8385835 hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking

8385839 as strong a supporter of ethics reform as the senate has ever known and his office follows all ethics laws right down to the letter
8385840 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president

8385989 i share both his philosophy and vision for the company
8385990 the actions of this inspector would have been unknown and could have jeopardized the safety of our customers and crew
8385991 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8385992 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8385993 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8385994 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8385995 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8385996 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8385997 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8385998 the creation of a scrapbook relies on childlike wonder at being alive a magpies eye and the fascination with the environment that compels one to record what they see and experience the scrapbook not only lies at the very heart of creativity it has beco me an art form all of its own
8385999 it used to be an elite thing theyve taken street art and they make the galleries come to them i want to be like that
8386000 everyone from a senator can enjoy it to a bum on the street its available to everyone
8386001 were making more art for the people rather than the super high end stuff
8386002 they dont wear corporate logos for anybody theyre going to endorse obama the way they want
8386003 everyone wants to use their own voice to endorse obama
8386004 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8386005 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8386006 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8386007 however any deviation to the left of the forecast track could bring the centre of gustav very near jamaica
8386008 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8386009 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8386010 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8386011 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8386012 thats one of the things i admire about him hes a real spouse and he reacts the way a real spouse does
8386013 he didnt like when his wife was attacked and he responded accordingly and thats the way i hope my spouse would have reacted if i was attacked
8386014 hes got a lot of thoughts and hell come up with a lot of good things
8386015 mr clinton sought and often managed to convince americans that the global economy was an opportunity and not a threat
8386016 whatever his legacy from this campaign that legacy of his presidency should be built upon
8386017 hes sort of yesterdays man trying to be todays man and he seems angry about it
8386018 he doesnt seem to know what to do with himself and focused so much energy on his wifes campaign and when it didnt go their way he got quite nasty
8386019 this theory is false and is flatly rejected by president clintons doctors
8386020 numerous errors it is in short journalism of personal destruction at its worst
8386021 i think theres a good deal of evidence that he is quite a bit angrier than he used to be
8386022 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8386023 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8386024 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8386025 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8386026 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8386027 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8386028 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8386029 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8386030 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8386031 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8386032 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8386033 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8386034 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8386035 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8386036 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8386037 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8386038 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8386039 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8386040 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8386041 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8386042 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8386043 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8386044 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8386045 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8386046 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8386047 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8386048 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8386049 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8386050 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8386051 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8386052 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8386053 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8386054 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8386055 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8386056 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8386057 the knowledge worker and the ad hoc use of paper
8386058 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8386059 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8386060 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8386061 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8386062 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8386063 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8386064 risks when acquiring parts and materials through distribution channels other than those franchised or authorized by the original manufacturer
8386065 we have not yet developed a consistent set of standards and inspection requirements that can flow throughout the supply chain to ensure consistent application and mitigation of the risk of using counterfeit parts
8386066 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8386067 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8386068 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8386069 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8386070 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8386071 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8386072 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8386073 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8386074 nicollette sheridan y michael bolton han cancelado su compromiso de forma amigable

8386076 there is combat every day in this province and that isnt going to end any time soon
8386077 we are going to stay in the fight and we have to stay active in order to prevail and not lose the initiative to the insurgents
8386078 do we have enough soldiers and policemen to control this province at this time the answer is no
8386079 this blatant disregard for human life is simply not acceptable
8386080 i am happy to report we that we have had very few civilian casualties as a result of our operations in kandahar province this year
8386081 we deeply regret any accidental loss of life that occurs as a result of our actions
8386082 the raid destroyed one of the largest ied factories to date within zhari panjwaii and seriously disrupted the insurgents ability to produce and deploy improvised explosive devices
8386083 there is no doubt many lives have been saved as a result of these operations
8386084 let me be clear we do expect further attacks you dont have to look very hard to find proof that there are serious challenges to security across afghanistan

8386089 the knowledge worker and the ad hoc use of paper
8386090 weve already seen crude oil become a key outside market that has led price moves in many other markets like the grains soft commodities metals and even the value of the u s dollar
8386091 right now traders fear the worst and are factoring that into the market price structure
8386092 if gustav starts to weaken significantly in the coming days then that hurricane risk premium will be taken out of the markets price structure quickly which in itself would cause higher market volatility
8386093 investors in many markets should be extra cautious heading into this weekend
8386094 jeffs expertise in global operations and finance will further strengthen oracles senior management team
8386095 we look forward to having him join us as our new cfo
8386096 jeff is an exceptional executive who has consistently increased stockholder value
8386097 his financial and technology industry experience will be an asset for oracle
8386098 i am thrilled to be joining one of the worlds most dynamic innovative and fast moving companies
8386099 oracle has continually led the industry from product innovation and development to its strategic acquisitions the company continues to exhibit operational excellence and i am honored to join such a strong team
8386100 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8386101 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8386102 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8386103 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8386104 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8386105 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8386106 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8386107 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8386108 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8386109 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8386110 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8386111 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8386112 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8386113 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8386114 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8386115 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8386116 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8386117 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8386118 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8386119 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8386120 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8386121 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8386122 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8386123 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8386124 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8386125 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8386126 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8386127 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8386128 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8386129 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8386130 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8386131 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8386132 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8386133 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8386134 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8386135 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8386136 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8386137 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8386138 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8386139 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8386140 that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his little fist youre hooked for life

8386161 la russia ieri ha riconosciuto lindipendenza dei territori dellossezia del sud e dellabkhazia non stata una decisione presa alla leggera anzi sono state considerate tutte le conseguenze ma era impossibile non tenere conto della storia dellabkhazia e dellossezia del sud del desiderio dindipendenza delle loro popolazioni dei tragici eventi delle scorse settimane e dei precedenti internazionali
8386162 ignorando gli avvertimenti della russia i paesi occidentali hanno fatto a gara per riconoscere lillegale dichiarazione dindipendenza dalla serbia del kosovo

8386235 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8386236 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8386237 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8386238 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8386239 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8386240 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8386241 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8386242 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8386243 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8386250 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally

8386267 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8386278 we are extremely grateful to the evelyn and walter haas jr fund for generously supporting this important collaboration
8386279 the more than 2 5 million individuals in the 3 100 congregations supported by the institute for welcoming resources and these partner organizations are some of our movements most valuable advocates in promoting understanding reclaiming what unfortunately has become a narrow view of moral values espoused by those who seek to divide and advancing lgbt equality we thank the haas jr fund for not only recognizing this but for providing the critical resources to advance these pro lgbt faith organizing efforts
8386280 we are excited that this grant will help the institute for welcoming resources realize its vision to significantly increase the number of local congregations and parishes committed to the full inclusion of lgbt people
8386281 were convinced that this unique partnership among the task forces iwr program and denominational advocacy organizations holds the potential to transform the larger lgbt movement by greatly expanding its supporters and extending its reach
8386282 a sea change is under way in faith communities across the country
8386283 the day is fast approaching when people will hear the word christian and associate it with justice equality and support for all including lgbt people this collaborative grant is one concrete way were going to get there
8386284 this is the kairos time the opportune time when the church and the world are about to turn while full inclusion of lgbt people in the life of the lutheran communion requires a marathon strategy what we do in the next 12 months will be critical to the success of the mission of lutherans concerned north america over the next 20 years
8386285 the timely and generous grant from the haas jr fund will enable lutherans concerned north america to maximize its strategic impact by increasing organizational and financial capacity enhancing volunteer and leadership development at the grassroots fostering continued expansion of our reconciling in christ program and organizing for the 2009 evangelical lutheran church of america synodical and churchwide assembly seasons where major decisions will be made about the full inclusion of lgbt people and families and pastors
8386286 haas jr was able to see the longtime activism and organizing in frontier territory provided by reconciling ministries network rmn for equality for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender persons rmn puts these monies to work immediately building infrastructure training new leaders creating networks in new regions and strengthening advocate teams across the united methodist church such strategic investment allows us to impact denominational change from the grassroots to the worldwide legislative sessions of the church
8386287 we are extremely thankful for this grant it will enable us to move to the next level of programming and effectiveness as a faith in action organization this includes developing and implementing a systematic process to help episcopal parishes become more welcoming and affirming of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people in their congregations and communities
8386288 the haas jr fund helps the ucc coalition for lgbt concerns equip volunteers for our mission to educate and advocate for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people and their allies and to save lives by training people in suicide intervention
8386289 developing and vitalizing open and affirming churches that not only welcome lgbt people in but also reach outside their congregations makes a difference in both church and society this investment from the haas jr fund makes it possible for the coalition to build the internal systems that make more effective the hundreds of our volunteers who participate in the movement for lgbt rights
8386290 as a national grassroots movement working for lgbt equality in the presbyterian church usa and civil society since 1974 we have been able to accomplish much as a nearly all volunteer network with one full time staff person the funding from the evelyn and walter haas jr fund allows more light presbyterians to build capacity and take our next steps as an organization and network by hiring additional staff
8386291 we stand at the threshold of accomplishing policy change and ending discrimination against lgbt persons and their families in the presbyterian church usa as we enter a national campaign to ratify the recent legislative victory at the 218th general assembly of the presbyterian church usa this grant makes it possible for more light presbyterians to create this national campaign

8386293 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

8386301 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8386302 he doesnt like being at the mercy of others he likes to be in control of what hes doing

8386320 instead of us being on defense on social weve got to put him on defense about peoples checkbooks
8386321 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8386322 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8386323 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8386324 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8386325 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8386326 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8386327 the actions outlined today position us to focus on the strategic alternatives process that we initiated several months ago as well as preserve our cash resources
8386328 the process we are conducting involves a number of alternatives including merger or acquisition of the company together with the possible sale of our c difficile and dna replication inhibition programs while the process is ongoing we are encouraged by our progress to date
8386329 overtons has executed the transition better than we could have expected to go from nothing to about 40 catalog pages of gander mountain products in under six months demonstrates the synergy of the acquisition and the flexibility of their available capacity
8386330 had it not been for stetsons part time program i wouldnt have even entertained the thought of transitioning to a law career at this phase in my life
8386331 we overcame difficulties caused by the sichuan earthquake and we made significant progress in the second quarter with net revenues gross profit and net income all increasing more than 30 year over year we continue to expand our business yet place a strong emphasis on operational efficiency and the maintenance of robust margins
8386332 on the operational front we maintained the positive momentum of our flagship game zt online which reached 2 1 million peak concurrent users on april 26 2008 the highest pcu recorded within the industry at the time the sustained popularity of this game is a testimony to the strength of our strategy which takes a focused approach towards developing and marketing hit games moving forward we believe this strategy will help our current and pipeline games including giant online achieve similar success throughout the second quarter our extensive marketing efforts proved successful as consolidated active paying accounts grew 41 year over year and average concurrent users rose more than 20 over the same period
8386333 as we continuously enhance our game content we remain focused on
8386334 lastly our recently announced us 150 million share repurchase program not only reaffirms our confidence and optimism in the long term potential of giant but also reflects our ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value

8386374 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8386375 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues

8386383 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8386384 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8386385 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8386386 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8386387 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8386388 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8386400 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8386401 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8386402 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8386403 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8386404 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8386405 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8386406 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8386407 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8386408 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8386409 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8386410 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8386411 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8386412 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8386413 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8386414 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8386415 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers

8386453 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8386454 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8386520 a high alert has been sounded in jammu due to the terrorist infiltration from across the border
8386521 this civilian hostages is what is holding us up from launching final onslaught we are ready for that
8386522 the rally has been cancelled based on the request of the authorities in view of infiltration of militants and their attacks on outskirts of the city in which some people were killed
8386523 it isnt a routine case of murder loot and burning in this case members of a particular community were singled out burned alive and their properties looted such lawlessness needs to be sternly dealt with
8386524 i wonder why political parties and human rights proponents insist on the human rights of terrorists while common people dont even seem to have the right to live
8386525 ill never forget this black wednesday i was on a morning walk around 5 30am with friends when we heard what sounded like gunshots
8386526 it was for a friend his mother had called on my phone and sounding distraught asked us to get back to our homes quickly apparently she had heard the news that terrorists had sneaked into the area and were engaged in a gunbattle with army jawans
8386527 we realised at once the danger we were in terrorists had hit our locality it left us cold for a minute
8386528 while the two terrorists were killed the photographer ashok sodhi along with five others was killed during that encounter with terrorists
8386529 we stopped there soon the security forces began retaliatory fire we knew it was dangerous to be there but couldnt help it those who had been called by their parents returned home while i hung around
8386530 between deathly silences there were these crackles of gunfire army vehicles kept moving in around 9 am heavy firing began and continued until afternoon i thought the idea was to ensure that the terrorists ran out of ammunition but the terrorists were able to sustain by periodic firing one of them was apparently shot thats what we heard
8386531 obama dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot

8386534 as broadcasting groups our focus is with results across markets not the performance of individual markets or individual stations because we recognize the dynamics of radio where the only constant is change we strongly support electronic measurement
8386535 that the only ppm market with mrc accreditation is houston a market with in person recruiting which arbitron has indicated they will not use in any other markets it appears that in trying to rush out ppm arbitron is sacrificing the accuracy of the data if any of the pieces are wrong then the overall outcome will be wrong therefore if hispanics are not properly represented then all of the stations in the market will be impacted and the losers in the end are listeners
8386536 on august 13 2008 four of the countrys top 10 hispanic markets including the number one market officially received their first pre currency ppm report broadcasters are now seeing that some spanish stations increase their ratings and rank position significantly in ppm
8386537 arbitron first debuted ppm ratings pre currency reports in new york last october and while an average of 8 percent of our hispanic panel has been replaced each month with brand new hispanics the ratings results in this market have not changed dramatically
8386538 today the hispanic ppm sample has also improved to a point where for the past several months in new york it has consistently out performed the diary on nearly every measure
8386539 our work is never done and we will continue to put forth an earnest effort to work together with broadcasters and agencies to improve areas that can benefit from it
8386540 at the same time that we look to the future i want to take this opportunity to point out the facts on ppm samples today in the wave of markets rolling out now ppm has the largest local market electronic media ratings panel ever maintained the hispanic sample size is more than twice the size of the current nielsen lpm hispanic panels
8386541 the spanish dominant hispanic ppm sample across all 10 deployed markets including new york and l a is over representative of the hispanic population and performs higher than the diary the average ppm proportionality in june 2008 was 119 percent where 100 is the goal the diary method achieved 101 percent in the last survey available survey for all of these markets
8386542 hispanic panelists agree to participate in our ppm panels in higher percentages than non black non hispanics we cannot say the same thing about the diary service
8386543 spanish dominant ppm panelists participate in higher percentages each day than any other panelists we cannot say the same thing about the diary service
8386544 ppm includes individuals in cell phone only homes whereas the diary does not these panelists tend to be hispanic and young the cell phone only population is a fast growing segment of the population and will be an increasingly important part of our panel
8386545 hispanic 18 34 year olds ppm panelist counts in june are at or above target in 8 out of 9 of our panels six are over 100 percent two are over 97 percent and only nassau suffolk is below target but climbing the diary service is not performing at this level
8386546 our hispanic customers have asked for additional panel characteristics and controls in ppm such as country of origin more discrete language weighting by age groups and in home in person coaching these measures and controls do not exist in our diary service and they would be yet another way that our electronic service will surpass all former radio ratings collection systems
8386547 despite the facts noted above a concern has been raised that ppm
8386548 be made right those who have not had an opportunity to see the facts but have seen the headlines in industry trade magazines might assume there is a bias against hispanics in the ratings the reality is that in ppm hispanics have the highest listening levels of any ethnic group hispanic stations have among the highest time spent listening in ppm
8386549 hispanic stations total weekly count of listeners increase virtually across the board in ppm
8386550 why dont my ratings look like the dairy the difference in ratings between diary and ppm has been quantified and it is because of the measurement tool
8386551 after electronic measurement the diary is the best radio survey method available and it does a terrific job of measuring core radio listening habits yet anyone who needs to understand why differences in radio listening exist between diary and ppm need only come to arbitron headquarters to view how the american public records their listening in the diaries the diary gets the job done well but there is better way to deliver more granular and timely results with accountability that advertisers demand
8386552 a changeup unless it is johan or hamels like can not be relied upon as your top pitch thats all heilman has

8386590 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8386591 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us

8386593 wiis unique interface and market leading hardware sales rates have convinced publishers to deepen support levels for the platform cheap development costs have also enabled a number of smaller publishers

8386600 workers understand whats happened to them over the past eight years they understand that we have to elect democrats
8386601 its important that workers recognize that they need political power to achieve changes
8386602 we couldnt get the employee free choice act if we had a continuation of the republican administration workers are understanding more and more that mccain would just be a continuation of the bush administration
8386603 the chamber is a bipartisan organization but clearly we endorse far more republicans than we do democrats because were a business organization
8386604 this is a battle that these guys are going to find very uncomfortable
8386605 very talented one of the next generation of bass players

8386614 we get several calls phone calls from folks that are having a little bit of difficulty getting them set up yeah we get a number of calls
8386615 the data suggests that we are in the midst of the credit crisis not its end
8386616 not only are traditional institutions slowing their lending but the cmbs market has remained sidelined for almost a year
8386617 cash investors and foreign investors will remain significant sources of capital in the u s market throughout 2008 and the end of 2009
8386618 both democrats and republicans want to make it permanent and theres one simple way to make that happen just do it
8386619 times are tough so we cut our marketing budget to save money
8386620 she angles her belly button toward him shes treating him with respect she has her hands in a fig leaf position which tends to be a passive position really turning the power over to obama we face our belly buttons and the core of our body to people we like have affinity toward and people we respect and shes doing it
8386621 we certainly had a round of meetings yesterday at each workplace but weve had no real indication about any great detail from them
8386622 theres been no let up in what they intend to do
8386623 the practice principal at redlands veterinary clinic will be provided with a copy of your complaint and asked for a response to the concerns you have raised as to the hygiene standards of the practice as observed by you
8386624 we would probably carry out 3 500 different procedures or interactions with horses each year and id be surprised if we had 20 or 30 problems and infections so i think the success rate we have is remarkable
8386625 their first demand was france then they negotiated for libyan asylum then they had no other solution there was no escape
8386626 i heard all the goings on it was rational and calm
8386627 we are united in our view that her actions over the last two weeks have been damaging not just to international stability but also to the respect with which russia and the trust that russia holds around the world
8386628 we both want to defend international rules that respect the sovereignty the integrity and the democracy of nation states

8386636 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8386637 we decided to strike the whole thing and come up with something better
8386638 we all recognize the challenges in todays economy but based on what ive been hearing from people and companies throughout the region i am cautiously optimistic that we can reach this goal it will require all of us coming together and truly living united
8386639 existe um compl para inferiorizar a imagem do rio perante as demais cidades do pa s
8386640 this is the sort of thing i would like my character to engage with and be challenged by
8386641 id like the rebellion against the evil empire to be a major element of the game
8386642 this truly generous contribution from the howle family exemplifies the long time leader tycho howle has been within the clemson community
8386643 it is the ultimate gift that embodies what we are about at clemson we are extremely grateful
8386644 my lifes work has been the application of computer technology to help make companies more efficient and more responsive
8386645 as computer technology continues to advance i like the notion of smart people continuing to apply those advances to take on difficult and challenging societal needs my career and accomplishments are all due to the great education i received my life would have been entirely different had i not had the benefit of my clemson education
8386646 as we strategize our contributions we like to think of approaches that motivate others to give too
8386647 on several occasions we have spearheaded matching funds programs where we match contributions that others give and thus make their contributions go farther its rewarding to see our grants cause a multiplier effect that increases the impact on the important missions of the organizations we support
8386648 tycho is a leader by example always doing first before reaching out to his friends business relationships and the wider community
8386649 he is not only generous but also highly engaged with the mission of our not for profit organization by asking questions to achieve a deeper level of personal understanding he constantly elevates our collective thinking which drives a higher vision of the possibilities we can achieve at childrens when tycho and marie established a challenge grant in 2001 to encourage five figure individual donations none of us realized how successful the program would be and how quickly today due in great part to tychos innovation we now have more than 350 donors making annual donations to childrens of more than 10 000 each
8386650 tycho and maries support of the j paul austin invitational golf tournament serves as a tremendous catalyst to jump start the event each year and is instrumental in helping us reach our goals for the alzheimers association
8386651 with their unwavering support weve raised more than 2 million over the past 14 years their contribution is nothing short of a lifesaver year after year
8386652 theres something about sailing gleam out here on nantucket thats very special
8386653 i just figure bob had a grand plan in his mind for what he wanted to happen with gleam and the other boats so were trying to figure that out and carry it forward
8386654 well this particular chute was bought for the boat by a fellow who chartered her and bought a whole new set of sails
8386655 but bob was something of a packrat weve got a barn full of stuff thats vaguely nautical binnacles blocks winches pumps some pretty useful stuff plus there are all these spinnakers bob used to get the old ones when someone in the modern class replaced their inventory were still recycling them
8386656 i may move on at some point but when i go ill leave a piece of me on this boat

8386661 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8386662 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8386663 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8386664 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8386665 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8386666 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8386667 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

8386674 in kaum einem land kann man alkohol und zigaretten so leicht erwerben wie in deutschland
8386675 i feel like it is long overdue and i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous like we all dont have the same rights
8386676 all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours whereas all the testing says not really
8386677 people who have to deal with black employees find this not true
8386678 this is watson at his most scandalous he has said similar things about women before but i have never heard him get into this racist terrain
8386679 if he knew the literature in the subject he would know he was out of his depth scientifically quite apart from socially and politically
8386680 this study conveys an important message about how people construct estimates of group opinion based on subjective experiences of familiarity
8386681 the repetition effect observed in this research can help us to understand how our own impressions are influenced by what we perceive to be the reality of others for example a congressman may get multiple phone calls from a small number of constituents requesting a certain policy be implemented or changed and from those requests must decide how voters in their state feel about the issue
8386682 furthermore it is my opinion that carthage must be destroyed
8386683 no amount of genius spent on the creation of propaganda will lead to success if a fundamental principle is not forever kept in mind propaganda must confine itself to very few points and repeat them endlessly here as with so many things in this world persistence is the first and foremost condition of success
8386684 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8386685 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8386686 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8386687 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8386688 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8386689 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8386690 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

8386693 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and
8386694 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8386695 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8386696 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8386697 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8386698 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8386699 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8386700 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8386701 no financial incentive for fidelity to promote auction rate securities as opposed to other short term investments
8386702 instead of going for the megabucks you simply go to court for the important thing which is to establish whats true and whats not i think its a clearer and simpler way of dealing with this
8386703 this is pioneering a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of free speech with the right to reputation
8386704 people jet in from all over the world to launder their reputations
8386705 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8386706 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8386707 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8386708 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8386709 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8386710 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8386711 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8386712 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8386713 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8386714 ive been thinking a lot about what we did and i want to do it again
8386715 i am proud tonight to follow sen clintons call for unity and unite behind barack obama and elect him the next president of the united states

8386720 the world has changed and in obama i see somebody who can make this countrys diversity a competitive advantage
8386721 the republican party i joined was concerned about civil liberties and the economy but theyve shifted to the right
8386722 i wanted to be able to vote for the best candidate in this election
8386723 firefighters from folsom el dorado hills and sacramento metropolitan fire departments worked in the afternoon heat to extinguish the fire and salvage the homeowners household goods
8386724 the fire was under control in 15 minutes but firefighters were on scene until 10 p m
8386725 cooking equipment fires are the leading cause of home structure fires and associated civilian injuries these fires accounted for 40 percent of all reported home structure fires in 2005 and 36 percent of home civilian injuries twelve percent of the fires occurred when something that could catch fire was too close to the equipment
8386726 you only get so many mess ups and then its somebody elses turn
8386727 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8386728 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8386734 this joint venture conclude the fact that existing broadcasters and prospective new pay tv and licensed free to air operators will have access to digitechs facilities and those of its overseas partners such as telemedia
8386735 the digitech service will afford broadcasters two distinct advantages among which their signal instantly becomes national whereby any citizens of nigeria can receive their signals anywhere and west africa countries through a decoder
8386736 the software incubation centre will take off next year but at this stage we have concluded the feasibility studies on the project and setting up each centre will cost about n50 million this covers provision of building uninterrupted power supply computers and internet

8386754 theres a lot he can do at the convention to prove his respect for both clintons that would be very very welcome
8386755 if that were done it would be inevitable that millions of people would support obama with time money and votes
8386756 abc news reporter arrested for filming vip obama donors in public
8386757 at some point today possibly employing methods antithetical to democracy the democratic party will vote for its candidate for president the democratic party will vote to nominate hillary clinton for president or the party will commit suicide hillary clintons majestic speech last night does not help the unqualified to be president barack obama hillary clintons kind words about barack obama last night merely underline the obvious hillary must be the democratic party nominee if there is any chance to win the white house this year but the democratic party is on course to self slaughter
8386758 i hope mccain has the good sense to realize the potential gift hes been given
8386759 i think the clincher here will be when you tell her you actually own bibles and simply just dont rent them girls tend to like a man of means
8386760 im too young to remember but i thought the words said about him today were very touching
8386761 few will have the greatness to bend history but each of us can work to change a small portion of the events and in the total of all these acts will be written the history of this generation
8386762 each time a person stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance
8386763 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8386764 you are to be given the respect and recognition you have earned as delegates
8386765 as democrats and as americans we will leave denver united
8386766 i voted for hillary this morning because i gave my word and i keep my word
8386767 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8386768 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8386769 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8386770 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8386771 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8386772 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8386773 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8386774 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8386775 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8386776 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8386777 that question is on the minds of a lot of people

8386789 when youre looking down the barrel you wouldnt see that its smaller the detective didnt know that and neither would any other citizen
8386790 we are being attacked in every front i think sen obama is a great choice to get us back in line to bring the middle class back

8386792 obviously we want to ensure a strong future for the viper but as we focus on the core business well listen to people who have expressed interest
8386793 the market has changed significantly competition within that premium luxury category only intensifies and as a result it really puts something like the viper at a competitive disadvantage from the standpoint that its obviously a very niche focus with limited scale

8386931 bainbridge makes a great advance in framing the debate over corporate governance as a tradeoff between authority and accountability and he does an excellent job in extolling the benefits that authority brings
8386932 i do not disagree much with bainbridge s descriptive claim that shareholders have very little power
8386933 bainbridge s normative defense of board authority is the leading academic defense available for the basic contours of american corporate law
8386934 the contractarian law and economics tradition of scholars such as romano and easterbrook and fischel does explain and defend much of corporate law however as i have noted elsewhere that tradition does not do a great job of explaining why board authority is so hard wired into our corporate law
8386935 ive been back on the road for three years everybody knows my songs but there are still a lot of people who dont know the name

8386942 nobody has spent more time over the last two years attacking democrats than keith olbermann and chris matthews
8386943 and im just not going to get lectured on how to be a good democrat from them
8386944 the real crux of our system is highrise we use it in managing projects production post production and marketing we use it to stay organized we use it to manage our authorized retailer clients around the world and we couldnt breathe as well or sleep as well without it
8386945 our first task was to store documents that we use on to our important documents page traditionally these documents were stored on our company server but it was sometimes problematic accessing these via a vpn if we were working from home or abroad accessing them on the cloud via backpack has simplified this task and we are now working faster and with less hassle

8386949 i believe that as democrats and americans united you are to be given the respect and recognition that you deserve as delegates
8386950 i have spoken to many of you and you have questions about what to do you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8386951 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8386952 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8386953 the economic biases i discuss in my book for example are the main thing that prevents poor countries from switching to pro growth policies
8386954 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8386955 i want you to know that this has been a joy yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8386956 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8386957 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8386958 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8386959 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8386960 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8386961 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8386962 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8386963 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8386964 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8386965 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8386966 i have personal experience at that when i made my remarks about the rutgers basketball team which was mean spirited and directed at people who did not deserve to be made fun of and was not funny i apologized for that i didnt offer any lame excuses but he refused to place into context either my life or any of the work that i had done in my life
8386967 as i pointed out to al sharpton i slept in the house here at the ranch with more black children who are not related to me than either one of them the obamas ever have and then when this psychopath rev wright shoots his mouth off and i wasnt serious but he was serious making outrageous reprehensible remarks
8386968 the first thing senator obama asked all of us to do was to place this clowns life in perspective and to consider the context thats nonsense i dont detest senator obama at all i just think hes disingenuous and a phony
8386969 why do the democrats invite every loser dukakis and gore and john kerry and clinton hanging around to remind everybody that here is another guy who couldnt get it done i dont get that it just reminds us that its been one disastrous campaign after another
8386970 has the potential to be a president in the tradition of teddy roosevelt and i love the guy
8386971 oh uh there wont be any money but when you die on your deathbed you will receive total consciousness
8386972 o ur partners are monetizing 90 of all claims created through video id
8386973 this has led directly to a similarly significant increase in monetizable partner inventory as our video id partners are seeing claimed content more than double their number of views against which we can run ads this means that if a partner has say 10 000 views of its content leaving up videos claimed by our system will lead to an average additional 10 000 views of that same content
8386974 its certainly been a difficult year but buying out a partner is never an easy thing
8386975 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8386976 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8386977 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8386978 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits

8386984 the actions outlined today position us to focus on the strategic alternatives process that we initiated several months ago as well as preserve our cash resources
8386985 the process we are conducting involves a number of alternatives including merger or acquisition of the company together with the possible sale of our c difficile and dna replication inhibition programs while the process is ongoing we are encouraged by our progress to date

8386988 911 commission co chairs claim that they were misled perhaps deliberately by the bush administration and pentagon brass because 911 was an act of mass murder overtly covered up by the bush administration the many lies told amount to more than mere obstructions of justice or cover ups they amount to high treason a betrayal of the public trust a mechanism by which this administration seized power unconstitutionally upon the 911 pretext bush deliberately subverted the legitimate institutions of our government the lies told by bush and brass amount to sedition and high treason

8387235 this report reveals that many governments are demonstrating the will to change childrens lives but it also makes clear that there is much more still to do to protect children around the world from exploitive child labor
8387236 sustained partnerships by governments the private sector and international organizations are needed to provide these children with access to the education and resources to enable them to overcome the poverty and exploitation that has defined their childhood
8387237 education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty that traps children and their families
8387238 by highlighting child labor around the world we hope that this report will spur new actions and renewed momentum to rescue children from a life of poverty and exploitation and offer them a brighter future

8387262 our warnings last week that cuts to critical food inspections will endanger the health and safety of canadians have proven to be valid
8387263 first it was a leaked treasury board document revealing the conservatives secret plans to make cuts at the canadian food inspection agency and now its the head of the union that represents food inspectors telling us that some of these cuts have already taken place
8387264 the death toll continues to rise and people continue to be hospitalized from tainted meat and yet the conservative government is misleading canadians about its plan to abandon critical food safety inspections this governments cavalier attitude towards canadians health is astonishing
8387265 and all of this only came to light after people died
8387266 it is time for the conservatives to come clean first they hid the plan then they falsely claimed that it was only a discussion document then they falsely claimed it had not been implemented today however it is clear that the plan is real it has timelines and at least parts of it have been implemented the lies have to stop

8387270 i think its something people will notice and i am really concerned about those who have to make tough choices
8387271 people may not be happy but its the economy and its beyond our control
8387272 its a lot of little things that add up to big savings
8387273 when you start including more fresh fruit and vegetables instead of green beans in a can your costs increase
8387274 were not trying to make a profit were just trying to break even
8387275 i think theres going to be people upset but i also think theres very little anybody can do about it because its part of a bigger picture
8387276 we think its really going to build on our best practices and lessons learned from our operations in iraq but recognizing that it needs to be tailored to the local afghan population
8387277 the big thing that he came out of there with is they were doing a warehouse operation

8387283 we expect further downward revisions as the yearprogresses and casual dining continues to feel the pain ofreduced discretionary spending
8387284 due to aggressive unit expansion and the potential forheightened share repurchases debt reduction is likely to beless of a priority for darden
8387285 if combined same restaurant sales growth remains negativein the near term the company becomes more aggressive withshare repurchases and credit statistics weaken more thananticipated dardens ratings could be downgraded
8387286 we feel the elevated food and gas prices highunemployment rate and depressed home prices will continue tohurt the us consumer through end calendar year 2008
8387287 as such we feel the consumer willcontinue to rein back on discretionary dining expenses or tradedown to more affordable alternatives
8387288 we will be signing a memorandum of understanding with the maharashtra government

8387291 we must change this you need more deliverables i want you to have molten lead in your belly at all times

8387296 as we all know some franklin aldermen will be pushing to spend franklin taxpayer dollars on an interchange in the city of oak creek on i 94 amp drexel avenue
8387297 what im witnessing here ladies and gentlemen are some city officials boldly going where no elected official has gone before promoting to give our funds to an outside identity in the city of oak creek
8387298 to further my point towards our elected leaders id encourage them to end the potential hypocrisy theyd be creating by supporting an oak creek project

8387301 to further my point towards our elected leaders id encourage them to end the potential hypocrisy theyd be creating by supporting an oak creek project
8387302 we all need to be prepared and ready to respond from the citizen level and at every level of government
8387303 all thats happened is that its gotten worse for fannie and freddie
8387304 but the stocks go up every day where is that barrons source
8387305 the idea that youre just being created and your soul isnt there what you put into the character isnt coming out its a scary thought its a threatening thought in fact
8387306 but the advantages and uses of it are amazing and i guess well have to get used to it

8387308 by defining the high speed serial protocol and the connection method weve given designers a standardized solution with a flexible configuration that can support virtually any design
8387309 the 2008 fiscal year was challenging for us given the ongoing turbulent economic conditions in the north american automotive market and the delays we experienced in the ramp up of new products in our technology products segment
8387310 we have new commercial products that we anticipate will begin to ship in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009
8387311 as is true with most new products we anticipate we will begin to ramp up production during the quarter as a result and as we have experienced in the past the first quarters sales of the new products will likely be at lower levels than in subsequent quarters the market acceptance of bk5500 that we began to ship in may has been excellent the early signs are that the product will be very successful in the mechanics marketplace we also plan to begin shipping new automated systems products in the first half of fiscal year 2009 that will improve the functionality and performance of our systems these will help us to compete as we continue to address the soft automotive markets that we expect to see in north america and europe we expect sales in north america and europe in fiscal year 2009 to be below fiscal year 2008 levels sales in asia are expected to continue to grow in fiscal year 2009 and offset the decline in north america and europe
8387312 during fiscal year 2008 we continued to invest for future growth principally in the development and sale of new commercial products and in personnel for new geographic growth opportunities for automotive in asia and parts of europe
8387313 overall we expect to continue double digit revenue growth in fiscal year 2009 along with a significant increase in operating income we are excited about all of our new products and investments and the long term returns we expect they will bring our company and its shareholders
8387314 we are pushing this material to uk media channels e g a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media

8387328 religion is best served when parents not the public schools are responsible for directing their childrens religious education
8387329 religious freedom is eroded when the government endorses any particular religious viewpoint

8387335 sept 11 motivated the united states to behave really differently in the world
8387336 that is to say americans realized that even in their homes they could not feel safe they had to protect their interests outside the boundaries of the u s for russia it is the same thing we were sitting in our homes the national discussion was internal now this georgian attack is perceived as aggression and made us realize that we cannot stay home we have to go outside our homes to protect ourselves on new frontiers

8387358 finalizing the partnership was more of a formality something we had planned to do after seeing how powerful a tool it was for managing web sites
8387359 ektron has so many powerful features but the search engine is my favorite
8387360 google has taught people to search for what theyre looking for and its no different when people visit a web site if they dont find what theyre looking for they leave period ektrons built in search engine is the best ive seen in a cms and it will keep users on the web site and thats huge
8387361 i am excited to see this group of individuals appointed to the first board of trustees of the canadian museum for human rights this new museum will benefit greatly from their diverse skill sets
8387362 with their strong leadership this museum will take its deserving place in the history of our country as the first federal museum dedicated to the topic of human rights
8387363 day gardner the leader of a black pro life speaks on presidential candidate barack obama
8387364 senator obama doesnt care that abortion has obliterated the rights of more than 15 million black children since 1973
8387365 he doesnt care that abortion is the no 1 killer of african americans surpassing deaths caused by accidents heart disease stroke crimes hiv aids and all other deaths combined
8387366 he wont make one of his powerful speeches decrying the injustice of abortion providers as they plant killing centers firmly in black communities making it easier to kill black children instead he actually applauds their efforts these children are denied their most basic human right which is the right to life a right which our ancestors so proudly worked for marched for and many of them died for
8387367 in 2001 and 2002 obama was the lone senator speaking against born alive on the senate floor in 2003 obama killed the bill altogether by burying it alive in a committee he chaired
8387368 by the third time obama tried to snuff born alive he was running for the u s senate the federal version had passed the year before unanimously in the senate and almost unanimously in the house even naral went neutral pro aborts agreed to let it pass without a fight lest they appear extreme
8387369 except obama he decided to battle alone further left than any other senator boxer clinton kennedy kerry et al
8387370 unfortunately barack obama supports the ruthless culture of death one that includes killing the smallest americans too small to flee or fight back
8387371 damn you body that was a perfectly good 5 days to lose 2 pounds each on

8387387 no fire or injuries just a disruption to the operations here
8387388 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8387389 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8387390 those are the reasons i ran for president these are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8387391 a colleague and a friend who has served his country with honor
8387392 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8387393 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8387394 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan
8387395 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8387396 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8387397 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8387398 the only thing theyre going to do is in old brooklyn terms rabbit punch every day and obama has to show the american people that he can rabbit punch that he can be in that street fight
8387399 i think there was a reluctance initially in the obama campaign to engage in that i think they now realize they have to
8387400 john mccain has a great biography has been a pow
8387401 that you dont know whether i can be trusted to lead
8387402 but im just going to remind everyone here this election is not about me
8387403 its about you its about whos going to be fighting for you
8387404 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8387405 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8387406 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8387407 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8387408 barack obama has a plan to save the dream of homeownership for families whove lost their homes or fear they can never afford one unlike john mccain who has so many he cant keep track of them all
8387409 if you look past the speeches to his record its clear john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8387410 for all his talk heres the truth john mccain voted against establishing a national renewable energy standard he voted against tax incentives for renewable energy companies and for all his talk of drilling he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for big oil
8387411 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement over the issue of abortion
8387412 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8387413 if indeed its a repeat of katrina and rita were in for some troubling times
8387414 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8387415 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8387416 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8387417 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8387418 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

8387421 we wanted to do something outside our church building something the general public would feel comfortable coming to
8387422 draw in people that wouldnt normally come to the church
8387423 its a great family event that you can take your kids to
8387424 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8387425 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8387426 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8387427 however any deviation to the left of the forecast track could bring the center of gustav very near jamaica
8387428 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8387429 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8387430 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8387431 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8387432 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8387433 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8387434 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8387435 however any deviation to the left of the forecast track could bring the center of gustav very near jamaica

8387438 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8387439 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8387440 right now were talking about a tropical storm in haiti
8387441 theres a long way from where it is now to new orleans
8387442 if you find the defendant did not abide by the rules no matter how he might have fought or how many days he spent in the military if he violated the law of war that day you have a duty to find him guilty
8387443 its aggravating to us over 600 flights were affected which is about 60 000 people because of one computer glitch
8387444 we were doing a normal daily software load that we do a couple times a day
8387445 as we were doing the software load something got corrupted in the file and it brought the system down
8387446 this is one of the largest project management challenges the u s government has had since we put somebody on the moon
8387447 has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to maintaining current equipment
8387448 we continue to lose confidence in the reliability of the equipment we are tasked to use to keep the system safe and efficient
8387449 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8387450 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8387451 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8387452 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8387453 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good

8387461 we have made a lot of good connections with people along the way both people who agree and those who disagree
8387462 it has ended quite well usually when people often active duty military or veterans pull over to talk once you show people youre willing to listen and they understand that we are not attacking them personally we have had some good conversations and find there is a lot we can agree on
8387463 in the monroe county jail an older woman jailer was keeping an eye on us
8387464 she was excited that she was going to ft mccoy where they would let her carry an ak 47 and play the role of an insurgent and pay her 12 an hour there is such a powerful presence around military base that it affects peoples hopes and imaginations
8387465 bessie the kindly jailer should have an affinity for the iraqi mothers and grandmothers the refugees with sick children but no ones going to pay bessie 12 an hour to identify with them
8387466 this highly conditional expression of interest attributed a 90 million value to gold reserves equity
8387467 the expression of interest did not take into account gold reserves current financial position and gave little value for our companys proven and probable reserves of 10 2 million ounces of gold and 1 4 billion pounds of copper
8387468 we have excellent systems and process in place but this week it s our best efforts that failed not the regulators not the canadian food safety system
8387469 i emphasize this is our accountablility and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully

8387476 we are not alone and we know what we need to say from our websites and laptops the street corners and coffeehouses the delis and diners the factory floors and the bookstores on campus at the mall the synagogue sanctuary and mosque lets tell it where we can when we can and while we still can
8387477 maybe because he looks younger than his actual age barack obama gives young people hope that they can achieve the political representation that they dont have right now
8387478 you often hear that women racial minorities or homosexuals are under represented in us politics but by far its mainly young people who suffer from it
8387479 because when you live 30 miles from the next police station you have to be able to defend yourself

8387486 i am here today to release you as my delegates
8387487 what is so important is that at the end of today we will nominate barack obama and joe biden as the president and vice president of the united states
8387488 i want you to know this has been a joy yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8387489 i believe that as democrats and as americans we will leave denver united
8387490 he is the man i would call on at 3 00am
8387491 i fought a good fight but came up short and because we have a democratic process obama is our winner and i urge every last hillary supporter to become a obama supporter
8387492 mccain 2008 and claim to be hillary supporters disrespect her and everything she stands for everything she has fought for and everything she believes in
8387493 mccain 2008 hillary 2012 do not care about the families and the children who will need healthcare between 2008 and 2012
8387494 mccain 2008 are republicans there is no place for shortsighted hatred and a thirst for vengeance in the democratic party that is the drug that the republicans peddle
8387495 hillary i love you for the first time in my life i will be voting for a republican in november yes mccain looks much better capable trustworthy experienced and honorable than barack obama i will wait hillarys run in 2012 mccain 2008
8387496 she didnt make the case for obamas ability in international issues
8387497 the big plus is that you can now shoot video with a great lens
8387498 using an slr for movies may seem like yet another solution looking for a problem but nikon believe that the unique advantages offered by such a large sensor compared to any compact stills camera or camcorder will bring get users creative juices flowing these advantages include the ability to use selective focus effects in movie clips shallow depth of field the ability to shoot movies with fisheye or extreme telephoto lenses and the ability to capture movies in very low light thanks to the higher sensitivity

8387501 all of us are driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope that is why i love this country
8387502 i think it already has sent a wave of approbation and admiration in many countries around the world just knowing that this black boy who grew with just a loving mother and grandparents and that was about all he had to start with has now had a chance to become the nominee of the democratic party for president i dont think theres any doubt that theres a spirit and a bright new hope for america within this country and around the world and if obama is elected which i think he is going to be then i think that will be the transforming grace for the end of racism and prejudice and hatred between races in this country
8387503 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
8387504 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
8387505 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
8387506 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
8387507 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god

8387548 obama is the first presidential candidate who reminds me of kennedys eloquence and capacity to inspire they both despite their own special backgrounds convey to people that they understand and listen to every american citizen
8387549 he is blessed with a richly resonant voice that we love to hear he could read the telephone directory and it would sound good
8387550 he is very good at pauses and inflection and he cuts an impressive figure on stage all of which adds up to making an obama speech a special event
8387551 on the one hand he cant go wrong in invoking such an iconic speech that has become part of americana on the other hand the more obama talks about race the blacker he becomes and america still has a massive race problem

8387592 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8387593 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8387594 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies

8387596 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers

8387601 i am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here
8387602 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex and i will always pray to allah for continued success at sussex
8387603 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8387604 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county his legacy extends beyond the playing arena as im sure all that have been graced by his presence will agree he is simply a great man

8387620 the era of cheap energy is over the question is how are we going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8387621 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8387622 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8387623 we need 100 billion plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that
8387624 and we shouldnt do anything that has the effect of putting up bills further
8387625 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8387626 i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk
8387627 russia has huge energy resources and could be a really good partner for europe but its harder to do that when you see what is unfolding on the international stage
8387628 we must do as much as we can to get energy from indigenous sources britain needs more energy suppliers its harder to for us to have those energy relationships with countries that behave in the way russia has been doing lately
8387629 making a profit is better than making a loss and if we want these companies to invest significant resources investors are not going to do that if they dont think theres a reasonable return to be made on their investment
8387630 of course weve got to tackle climate change its a real and present danger for used but weve also got to be absolutely clear that our energy policy has got to be figured first and foremost with a view to supplying britain with affordable and secure energy it needs for the future
8387631 that is why we cannot turn our back on any proven form of technology we cannot afford to say no to new coal new gas or new nuclear

8387804 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services
8387805 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8387806 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8387807 we are hopeful that we can resolve issues without litigation
8387808 technology for the web sites overall is still developing and there would need to be some flexibility in those standards
8387809 standards should not be dictated by any particular individual it needs to be a collaborative process
8387810 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today
8387811 how can some aspects of the show be so consistently brilliant and other aspects be completely terrible

8387816 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
8387817 im so tired of reading rave reviews for edge who has rapidly become not just the most overrated
8387818 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8387819 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today

8387826 if she meant it as a paraphrase of something that has been attributed to harriet tubman that might be understandable
8387827 but if she was meaning to quote harriet tubman directly that puzzled me
8387828 by the time harriet tubman enters fully into the american consciousness as an american icon her historical person has been so mixed up with ideas that cannot be historically substantiated that what passed into memory was the mythologized symbol not the historical person
8387829 because she was illiterate we have mediated histories of her stories always told by others that leave it open to a great deal of interpretation and reinterpretation by each generation as they search for a usable harriet tubman
8387830 while this is frequently attributed to her and you find it in many books written for children i was unable to find it in any of the primary documents that date from harriet tubmans life or something that she might have recounted to someone else who then took it down firsthand
8387831 semifictional accounts of her life in the 1950s or even later in the 1960s when there was an explosion of interest in writers at a time when there was a great felt need for remedying the neglect of african american history
8387832 bound for the promised land harriet tubman portrait of an american hero
8387833 historically inaccurate notion that she had something coming to her

8387844 the only thing that strikes me as out of the ordinary here is that its usually the other way around

8387846 congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press
8387847 how the image would be perceived by a motorist passing it in transit
8387848 the reason we have advised you that we cannot post these as billboards is that out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
8387849 my son and his friends would have been of draft age had there been a draft though none of them volunteered for military service since the war began i wondered about the young men and women who opted to serve and put their lives on the line i wondered about what they would experience at war and how they would manage their transition to civilian life in making these portraits i wanted to look into the face of a young person who had seen something unforgettable and i wanted to make that a serious and intimate view the way i would look at my own son
8387850 viewing these portraits of soldiers causes one to pause and think of the many sacrifices and efforts these men and women have experienced to protect us and defend this great country the portraits are a stark reminder of the reality of it all
8387851 for me looking at their faces serves also as a reminder to remember our service men and women and to thank them for all they do and have done i am disappointed that the billboards have been canceled and strongly hope the company will reconsider
8387852 we have every intention of moving forward with our plans
8387853 barring these images from billboards in the twin cities or any city for that matter not only deprives the public of seeing these beautiful portraits but it is an insult to the young soldiers who posed for these pictures
8387854 insist that most of life isnt to be take seriously

8387860 audio history has always been an intrinsic element of aes convention programs but as we celebrate our 60th anniversary this year at the moscone center oct 2 5 it seems even more relevant
8387861 historical events chair tamara horacek collaborated with aes members marina bosi gene radzik and steve fields to develop an absorbing program which lends a timely perspective to three of the most significant sectors in todays professional audio industry
8387862 it is interesting to note how many of these products are still in daily use decades after their introduction
8387863 these arent simply museum pieces but working tools were proud to recognize their significance to the industry
8387864 what scientists have only recently begun to realize is that people may do their best thinking when they are not concentrating on work at all

8387871 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8387872 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8387873 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8387874 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8387875 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8387876 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8387877 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8387878 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8387879 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8387880 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8387881 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8387882 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8387883 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8387884 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8387885 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8387886 were going to spend every day looking for every opportunity to remind voters in the twin cities and across the country that a vote for john mccain is a vote for drinky mcdisastermonkey and his failed policies
8387887 but the appeals court said convery failed to make a detailed examination of jean strahans child support request and instead merely accepted her recitation of the childrens needs

8387908 this was apparently marion knights girlfriend that was riding with him in his car at the time
8387909 she started punching him while in the car he was the driver and she was the passenger in an effort to escape she grabbed the steering wheel and steered it to the curb

8387943 more than 70 percent of the oil used for transportation purposes here in the united states comes from foreign sources
8387944 because of this countrys reliance on coal u s consumers are fortunate to
8387945 with a 200 year supply the united states has more energy in the form of coal than the middle east has oil
8387946 the united states has more coal than any other fuel a quarter of all known coal reserves in the entire world is here in america and large coal deposits can be found in 38 states
8387947 ingenuity will further propel this country towards new and innovative ways to utilize coal that addresses energy independence economic and environmental needs
8387948 as mentioned by many democratic national convention speakers last evening there are a myriad of opportunities to leverage domestic coal to fuel other needs including transportation
8387949 accce advocates the vital role that clean coal plays and will continue to play in this nations energy portfolio
8387950 if the united states is to reduce its dependence on foreign energy imports while at the same time address realistic concerns associated with climate change then congress must fund this important technology research development and deployment to avoid placing the funding burden on americas families through increases in electricity bills

8387959 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8387960 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8387961 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8387962 they were all members of a family that had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8387963 my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8387964 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8387965 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8387966 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting

8387968 but these things always look easier on the blackboard than when you have do them in actual patients
8387969 but the biology of pancreative development is very closely related in mice and humans
8387970 i would say within five years we could be ready to start human trials
8387971 the idea to be able to reprogram one adult neuron type into another for repair in the nervous system is very exciting
8387972 this experiment proves you dont have to go all the way back to an embryonic state
8387973 you can use a related cell that may be easier to do and more practical to do
8387974 this adds to the large and growing list of studies helping to make embryonic stem cells irrelevant to medical progress
8387975 embryonic stem cells offer a unique window in human disease and remain a key to the long term progress of regenerative medicine
8387976 we achieved a complete transformation or re purposing of cells from one type to another we were delighted
8387977 it didnt cure the mouse but they were able to reduce their blood sugar levels to near normal
8387978 one day this may allow the doctor to replace the scalpel with a sort of genetic surgery
8387979 if this can be perfected it would represent one of the holy grails of medicine
8387980 you know seeing as im studying the ancients and they can be difficult i should see if someone on tweb would be willing to help me out
8387981 no se puede prometer lo que no se va a cumplir los plazos no se pueden comprometer a sabiendas que habr inconvenientes y no se pueden entregar subsidios ni tampoco permisos de construcci n sobre un rea verde mientras no est n regularizados los terrenos donde se construir n las viviendas
8387982 como siempre los di logos con la autoridad representada por el intendente ha sido muy interactiva y positiva pedimos el jueves la reuni n y se agend r pidamente de un problema han salido tres soluciones as que confiados esperamos solucionar los inconvenientes de acuerdo a la legislaci n vigente
8387983 ya han pasado a os desde que estamos en las mismas condiciones el gobierno se comprometi con nosotros y requerimos soluciones de estado no podemos seguir esperando indefinidamente ya que la paciencia se nos agota y tenemos problemas que resolver ahora los que se relacionan con las desmejoradas condiciones de vida en que habitamos en la pampa
8387984 vamos a intentar solucionar el problema buscando alternativas concretas para la gente existe la mejor y mayor disposici n de apoyarlos para que puedan tener su vivienda definitiva
8387985 i had a lot of friends who were called things like crane and melon so mine was relatively normal in comparison
8387986 i was brought up doing yoga and meditation and i had a very spiritual education that was more buddha than the bible but it had its downsides too living in a big shared house some people are inevitably going to annoy you so i experienced that on a big scale as a kid
8387987 i learnt how to observe people and suss them out from quite a young age which has been helpful in my songwriting plus because it would sometimes get a bit much id take myself off into the garden and sing to the slugs
8387988 i lost my canadian accent and used my middle name quicktime
8387989 i did sylvia young really really briefly but it just wasnt me
8387990 i was working as a pa at a massive healthcare company and going into work every day hating it
8387991 although that situation didnt work out belle ended up meeting some people from emi publishing who spotted she had a real talent for songwriting
8387992 i think im quite quirky id like to think my songs are well written and not just standard but that people can relate to the stories im very honest with what i write
8387993 id like to have done my first album and toured it
8387994 id like to be working on new material for my second album and have recorded that
8387995 well it would be quite nice if the album had charted at no 1 all over the world
8387996 im excited by everything going on and the way its turning out so far but i know i have to carry on doing what im doing and not get caught up in all the fuss
8387997 the global market for managed it and telecom services is large and growing among small and medium sized enterprises smes
8387998 we are proud to offer our new practical nursing program in response to the growing needs of our las vegas community
8387999 we are committed to providing career focused programs in high demand fields throughout clark county
8388000 sharing a credit card account can be risky if the other person is irresponsible in their spending our survey shows there is some concern about this practice and how it affects relationships
8388001 whether its your children or your spouse or partner you should really be careful about sharing a credit card account
8388002 results also show that peoples perception of having the right credit card for their needs makes a difference in their happiness
8388003 americans sensing a disconnect between themselves and their credit card typically double their likelihood of experiencing relationship discord on shared credit card accounts
8388004 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8388005 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8388006 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8388007 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8388008 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8388009 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8388010 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8388011 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8388012 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8388013 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8388014 this tutorial will guide you in installing setting up and using analogx netstat live which is free to monitor your internet usage uploads and downloads
8388015 went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago
8388016 he just broke the window and we all ran we just ran
8388017 and they told us to get out and we got out
8388018 for him to do that to us the way he did it it was a coward way out but gods gonna have to be his judge
8388019 this means that minesites like bgm can provide food resources for carnabys if they plan their revegetation strategies accordingly
8388020 if we can determine the areas they prefer to drink from we can go a long way to prevent them using contaminated areas
8388021 carnabys actually like to use some artificial water sources onsite such as drainage sumps these hold clean water all year round and have just the right combination of cover and openness with a small section of surrounding vegetation and trees
8388022 knowing this we can provide alternative drinking sources for cockatoos as well as design areas around the new residue disposal so they don t attract the cockatoo
8388023 over the last 50 years weve extensively modified the perth landscape to make it a better human habitat now its time to think about restoring some of the features that used to make it such good carnabys habitat
8388024 1 that plant twining direction is random 2 that twining direction is determined by plant tips following the apparent movement of the sun across the sky and 3 that twining direction is determined by the coriolis effect
8388025 we found no difference in the proportion of stems twining clockwise vs anticlockwise between the northern and southern hemispheres in fact 92 per cent of the stems we recorded twined in an anticlockwise direction
8388026 we rejected all three of our theories we are now investigating the possibility that the widespread phenomenon of anticlockwise twining arises as a function of the left handed bias of all biological molecules on earth
8388027 i am still aware of the terrifying new age that we scientists had complicitly helped set about in motion
8388028 poi dimprovviso mi sciolse le mani e le mie braccia divennero ali quando mi chiese conosci lestate io per un giorno per un momento corsi a vedere il colore del vento
8388029 the declaration of human rights is being distorted and damaged in the very name of human rights
8388030 to examine the human rights condition in all member states and to insist that they respect human rights
8388031 if a member is accused of severe and systematic abuse of human rights
8388032 sometimes the narrator has to throw their hate up on the wall and pass the mic its my show i love it the hills season 10 is what im going for
8388033 its about when you fall in love with someone about how i feel about spencer and my relationship
8388034 after the third game steve wasnt in there anymore and neither was i
8388035 i think some specific things would be to be more accurate and to get the ball out quickly across the board just continue to improve
8388036 i just need to do what i can to help this team win if harbaugh wants me to go out and play with troy then ill play with troy because we need to have that chemistry
8388037 if troy goes three quarters and harbaugh says i have to go three quarters then i have to play three quarters and deal with it
8388038 were not in an ideal situation but were not an ideal team right now
8388039 were a very young team a team coming off a 5 11 season our tackle retired and our starting quarterback retired all in one year and we have a new coaching staff so were not a typical team right now and the situation at quarterback is not typical
8388040 of course you would want that decision to have been made a long time ago but youve got to let this thing play out
8388041 after this game well all know who the starting quarterback will be
8388042 marc edouard is one of the top young defenceman in the game and we are excited to have him in to fold for the next several years
8388043 he has a tremendous future with this franchise and we look forward to watching his continued development
8388044 the best part about the break for us is we got to stay in first place for a month
8388045 all three teams have had great runs during the season and times where we struggled with injuries or whatever im just looking forward to see what happens
8388046 this break was good to defuse some of the negative publicity surrounding the incident we had
8388047 we felt we have a good opportunity to compete for an eastern conference championship this year and next year
8388048 shes an experienced player and makes our team better with her calmness and her pointers to our players
8388049 thats why coach laimbeer brought me here to do what taj mcwilliams franklin does best and thats definitely to help them win more games
8388050 she has that will where she will make her team win regardless of what adversity theyre facing you need somebody like that on the court
8388051 all seven teams still have a legitimate shot and a strong chance to work themselves either back into the race or improve currently in the race
8388052 championships are won on the road but its a lot easier when youre at home
8388053 playing against seattle or san antonio youd want that home court advantage
8388054 a lot of people question whether or not we can even make the playoffs but we still feel very confident
8388055 i believe that as democrats and americans united you are to be given the respect and recognition that you deserve as delegates
8388056 i have spoken to many of you and you have questions about what to do you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8388057 in an episode of his television show jerrys character purchased a jacket at a mens clothing shop the terms of the contract permitted jerry to return the item for refund at his discretion
8388058 in attempting to exercise his contractual discretion out of spite jerry breached his duty to act in good faith towards the other party to the contract
8388059 jerry would have been authorized to return the jacket if in his good faith opinion it did not fit or was not an attractive jacket
8388060 he may not return the jacket however for the sole purpose of denying to the other party the value of the contract jerrys post hoc rationalization that he was returning the jacket because he did not want it was rejected properly by bob as not credible

8388065 their experience in financial services will be of great benefit to rbs given the increasingly diversified and international nature of our powerful banking franchises
8388066 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8388067 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8388068 its strange that our actions to defend our citizens right on our borders should be criticised by britain considering its actions in the falkland islands which are the other side of the world
8388069 china is concerned about the latest development in south ossetia and abkhazia
8388070 i handed in a formal call to recognise the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8388071 which aims to unilaterally change the borders of georgia is quite simply unacceptable
8388072 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8388073 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8388074 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match and be able to win even when you feel tired
8388075 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8388076 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8388077 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8388078 my favorite job was being a quartermaster and hand steering the ship
8388079 i have also sailed on the old statendam iv rotterdam v and veendam iii
8388080 i might in three years but i just love the sea
8388081 what this shows is that you can go directly from one type of adult cell to another without going back to the beginning

8388085 this paper reports compelling evidence of paracrine signaling and the tumor growth inhibitory effects of hedgehog antagonists these data suggest that hedgehog antagonists may have therapeutic value not just in cancers driven by mutations in the hedgehog signaling pathway such as basal cell carcinomas bcc but also potentially in cancers where hedgehog signaling is driven by overexpression of the hedgehog protein
8388086 we are encouraged by our collaborator genentechs decision to conduct phase ii trials of gdc 0449 in colorectal and ovarian cancer in addition to a study in metastatic and locally advanced bcc we believe that the insights provided by these studies into the underlying mechanisms of hedgehogs involvement in cancer may lead to more effective treatment regimens using hedgehog antagonists such as gdc 0449
8388087 the emergence of next generation networks is placing additional pressure on carriers for increased mobile bandwidth

8388092 going on the road and ive talked about it with the team there is a mental and physical toughness you have to have to go and play and win in those settings
8388093 i do think kevin and chris forcier are on the verge of blossoming into very good players hopefully it could be as soon as monday night
8388094 i just believe that weve got to be relentlessly optimistic about what can be and keep giving ourselves chances to win football games
8388095 so were going to work hard to be in every game and give ourselves a chance for good things to happen at the end i think were going to find a way to surprise some folks
8388096 our calendars have enjoyed a very enthusiastic response from shoppers at green festivals and eco gift shows
8388097 women are particularly happy to discover an environmentally sensitive product they can buy for their husbands sons and fathers

8388104 together we can dial down our current climate of distraction
8388105 our business model is based on providing affordable medical care to the underserved middle income group in india
8388106 after nearly a decade of experience in asia we know that sophisticated hospitals built in neighborhoods rather than the central city are the best way to serve patients
8388107 it only took a year for our first hospital in india in the hebbal district of bangalore to operate at full capacity
8388108 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8388109 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8388110 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8388111 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match and be able to win even when you feel tired
8388112 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8388113 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8388114 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8388115 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8388116 hes willing to come here and help us try and win and do whatever we ask him to do which is great
8388117 were really happy to get a quality player who is also a quality person back to our team especially this time of year

8388119 he has a tremendous future with this franchise and we look forward to watching his continued development
8388120 i think there are lots of customers that want to play because in europe we love to play the only problem we had was that the games were becoming more and more difficult to play now that theres more accessibility some accessories that are helping people to have fun i think this market has no limit in the growth it can have if we can make sure that the people that are coming in are staying
8388121 oppression the eyes of hundreds of millions of people around the world have been opened wide to the massive degree of suppression the people of china struggle under day after day protests and demonstrations disallowed or strictly restricted controlled internet censored police surveillance and intimidation beyond our imagination and media censored controlled banned
8388122 it is the best thing you will ever do in your life it just lights up my whole world when max laughs
8388123 being a mother just gives you a whole new sense of purpose and its just the most amazing thing i was in awe of the entire experience of pregnancy the entire journey was just incredible
8388124 in this business it gets crazy the people that you sort of have to weed through with bad intentions or ulterior motives but you have to trust your instincts
8388125 we still have developers working on popular core gaming franchises but we need approximately two to three years to complete these games
8388126 we still have developers working on popular core gaming franchises
8388127 with regards to the lpga safety is obviously a non factor so the issue becomes is the language a player speaks fundamental to the competition i would not want to be the one who has to make that case
8388128 we are not discouraging players from speaking other languages they can talk to their caddy in whatever language they choose they can speak to other players on the driving range in whatever language they choose
8388129 if theyre brazilian and a reporter asks them a question in portuguese by all means answer it in portuguese
8388130 im so excited to finally be able to bring my show to new zealand this will be my second visit but my first concert performance and i cant wait to see you all there
8388131 the grand canyon the pyramids uluru and then theres kylie
8388132 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for
8388133 the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some asshole with a blog so hey i told you so

8388139 even with the michael jackson task whenever hed do something you guys would go thats amazing
8388140 thats not helping dude people with disabilities they wanna be able to do it to the best of their ability they dont wanna be told that things are amazing were all on tv and we dont wanna look like s
8388141 just shut up and dont say anything its the best way
8388142 but then its like hes always saying oh its on camera its on camera yeah exactly its on camera what nice people we are nice caring people there should be more like that in the world might be a better place
8388143 this all sucks we should write it over from scratch
8388144 how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
8388145 the court has issued an order asking the six defendants to stop protesting in government house and the area around the order takes effect immediately
8388146 we have discussed this and it is necessary that we have to defy the order
8388147 we have to fight so that our mission will be complete we would like to ask the mercy from the court to let us do our mission to restore the nation
8388148 we have to talk the senior police will talk about what to do next
8388149 we are going to wait here and wait for them to come in and get us
8388150 they have broken the law and it could be a serious setback for them
8388151 the government has a lot of options they have time on their side
8388152 the practice principal at redlands veterinary clinic will be provided with a copy of your complaint and asked for a response to the concerns you have raised as to the hygiene standards of the practice as observed by you
8388153 we would probably carry out 3 500 different procedures or interactions with horses each year and id be surprised if we had 20 or 30 problems and infections so i think the success rate we have is remarkable
8388154 the dalai lama will be leaving dharmsala tomorrow for mumbai for a routine medical check up he has been going to mumbai for regular health checkups on advice from his doctors for quite a long time
8388155 all his appointments and visits for the coming three weeks have been cancelled
8388156 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8388157 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8388158 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one
8388159 kate y sus abogados acaban de enterarse de la demanda y a ella no se le ha notificado oficialmente
8388160 nunca ha coincidido con ellos ni ha hablado con ellos
8388161 for us its about trying to create pressure around that lineout and the two key guys are the thrower and the caller so if you can create pressure for them to operate under its going to be more difficult
8388162 their decision making becomes a lot less accurate and that doesnt necessarily just apply to south africa thats at any time
8388163 i just thought through the level of accuracy the guys were able to put into it they were able to create a pressure situation where guys who are very very good made errors and thats what youre aiming for every week
8388164 the guys did a particularly good job probably one of our better performances against south africa in the last couple of years theres no doubt
8388165 regardless of what he looks like hes still a child hes not a monster
8388166 they kept telling us he wasnt going to survive but he did he kept fighting and kept getting better and better he had all sorts of infections and he made it through all of it he made it for seven years well almost seven years
8388167 because hes gone we dont have many pictures left of him from before the fire every picture that we have is like gold to us
8388168 this picture here shows him eating this is his first meal after the fire the hospital told us he would never be able to eat so these pictures are everything to us
8388169 we were so excited when he started to get better we just went picture crazy these pictures are not offensive theyre very very special
8388170 personally i would like for them to apologize to us first of all
8388171 felt kind of sad that me and my teammates couldnt play baseball
8388172 they said he was throwing too hard pitching too good i said thats not a reason i asked them to produce a rule or piece of paper stating that but they couldnt
8388173 we have a lot of beginner players that are not used to the speed of the ball it is the prerogative of the league to determine how the health and the safety of the players will be kept
8388174 i think he deserves the same opportunity that everyone else deserves
8388175 i think taking a kid out of a league and punishing him like that its not right
8388176 if the kid is good enough to play he should be able to play any position he wants
8388177 i just go over there to have fun anyway i dont go over there to win or lose
8388178 im essentially a checkbook and a sperm bank but im okay with that
8388179 i put this to the test i created thousands of tools
8388180 the companies agreed to resolve microsofts claim under a 2003 sublicense agreement as well as immersions counterclaim that microsoft breached a confidentiality agreement dated may 2007 immersion said in a statement
8388181 you see microsoft used immersions rumble in their 360 controllers without paying
8388182 but we dont owe him our vote because the stakes are too high
8388183 we have a choice in this election do we have a president who gets that people are struggling every day who gets that veterans are struggling every day or do we have somebody who doesnt get it
8388184 those are the choices that weve got to make in this election
8388185 and so i am going to fight as hard as i can over the next 70 days to make clear to the american people that they deserve a president and a white house that is fighting for them thats not fighting for the special interests thats not fighting for the banks and the oil companies and the well connected
8388186 ive been through it knowing what its like to try to scrape together the money to go to school and pay off tens of thousands of dollars in student loans after you get out
8388187 the great thing about america is we dont face these struggles by ourselves
8388188 were a proud people were a self reliant people but ultimately what makes this country great is we understand that we rise and fall together and its that spirit that i want to restore to washington
8388189 weve had two powerful women speak back to back on each night with michelle obama and hillary clinton
8388190 we have a massive infrastructure here with 300 hectares of land and 800 to a 1 000 personnel on site

8388196 that fuel can be stored for a very long time safely
8388197 it operates 24 hours a day seven days a week its the best most reliable form of emissions free generation that we have available
8388198 the fuel a ceramic and its encased in stainless steel
8388199 its a completely dry environment surrounded by inert gas helium inside a metal cask so theres not really any active aging mechanisms so that fuel and being stored in those types of containers can be stored for a very long time safely
8388200 we should have lots of nuclear because wind is not very good its subsidized by the government
8388201 nuclear is clean takes up less acreage its a better deal
8388202 the problem with nuclear is you end up with the spent fuel cells and nobody wants that in their backyard
8388203 weve got this wonderful power source hanging in the sky that shines every single day it doesnt make much sense not to use it
8388204 the next mx 5 needs to be a big step
8388205 the last one was too conservative and we cant do another car like that we need to make it more dramatic and give it some balls
8388206 the macaronis are like a bunch of 7 or 8 year olds that wont get out of the pool
8388207 we want to focus on the future and working together for the communitys benefit
8388208 the public is most interested in the fact we have settled

8388211 chief asset and most reliable tool for economic development is our historic architecture
8388212 this highly conditional expression of interest attributed a 90 million value to gold reserves equity
8388213 the expression of interest did not take into account gold reserves current financial position and gave little value for our companys proven and probable reserves of 10 2 million ounces of gold and 1 4 billion pounds of copper
8388214 i dont mean to be flippant but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste
8388215 youve suffered the pain now use it as a reason to make some changes youre at a fork in the road quite frankly a lot of jurisdictions are
8388216 this isnt bad news for us it means we will see further closures in our competing regions greater supply reductions greater opportunities in a number of respects
8388217 depending on the level of wealth you want to create i would suggest you want to grow more trees
8388218 some of them will better protect the endangered acadian forest and others will drive it to the brink of extinction new brunswicks forest is one of the most endangered in the country the question is which will they choose
8388219 this really is a sacred trust in terms of the governments responsibility towards the crown lands the public forest

8388225 it gives the government a fresh mandate that will give the government another couple of years to proceed
8388226 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8388227 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8388228 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8388229 would be enough to throw the liberals into turmoil and give harper a virtually free hand in parliament for quite a while and really handicap his main opponent
8388230 he doesnt like being at the mercy of others he likes to be in control of what hes doing
8388231 i suspect that theres some pretty strong or in depth party polls that are riding by riding that are persuading him that his chances are pretty good right now
8388232 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8388233 called me invited me to his home told me he had won and his intentions he said he wanted to bless the church
8388234 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not
8388235 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8388236 i think it is reflective of the unity that i sense that is building across the party
8388237 that doesnt mean there wont be outliers that are still heartbroken their favorite candidate didnt make it
8388238 going to be able to bring themselves to vote for anybody other than senator clinton
8388239 even though hillary tells us not to spend any time thinking about what might have been
8388240 im sure all of us were thinking about what might have been last night
8388241 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8388242 i think they are going to follow her lead and her lead was very crystal clear last night
8388243 if she can get up there and put everything aside and say shes supporting barack obama with her whole heart then its up to us to do the same thing
8388244 use the brush tool and only one color to draw a face
8388245 u gaat zeker een verhaal maken over het nut van subsidies
8388246 het is heel moeilijk om allochtonen respect voor de natuur bij te brengen als een grote nederlandse organisatie naar een moskee of naar turkse scholen gaat om voorlichting te geven heeft dat geen zin ons kennen ze wel en daarom hebben we 75 000 euro gekregen om het thema natuur en milieu op de agenda van turkse verenigingen te zetten daarom krijgen we ook bijna 180 000 euro om samen met de vereniging voor natuur en milieueducatie de turken in nederland bewust te maken van de relatie van milieuaspecten met passages in de koran ja dat is het rapport tussen deur en dampkring staat een groene moskee u vindt dat misschien onzin maar de natuur speelt in de koran een grote rol helaas beseffen veel gelovigen dat nog niet
8388247 daarom krijgen zeer diverse organisaties van ons subsidies ook als zij kritisch tegenover de rijksoverheid staan overigens krijgt lang niet iedere club geld van ons onze subsidie wordt driemaal overtekend
8388248 jullie richten je volledig op de milieusubsidies terwijl het bedrijfsleven vele malen meer geld krijgt hier lees ik bijvoorbeeld dat de stichting nederland maritiem land 670 000 euro subsidie krijgt ik zou wel eens willen weten waar dat geld naartoe gaat

8388258 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8388259 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8388260 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline

8388268 wants to make sure that we do the right thing in the future about how we deal with people in the world
8388269 i dont think you have to have that military background to perform well
8388270 this is a nice contrast for me to get around the state
8388271 i have to raise votes and i have to raise money votes are more important
8388272 the opportunity for me here is to highlight what western democrats have done in solving problems
8388273 its wonderful to have people here in the heart of the new energy economy
8388274 they are putting forth the most liberal face for colorado democrats

8388277 ive seen the consequences of kidney disease after all these years working with children
8388278 i knew i would be on a very short list i knew the match didnt have to be total so the decision to do it really came before the testing took place
8388279 ive been blessed with outstanding health so this was one of those things that needed to be done and i could do it
8388280 for someone to volunteer to do that is such a great blessing
8388281 he explained to me that he has had a heart for kidney patients since kidney camp
8388282 i have a friend in the quartet i play in who had a transplant and it has been wonderful to hear about her experience she said that even a couple of days after the surgery she already felt so much better

8388293 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8388294 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8388295 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8388296 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8388301 as i had no notion of whether there were those of your party still sleeping and did not wish to disturb them
8388302 yes i was in the arbors a few years ago you passed through there on some business
8388303 a place to sit and a drink of water would do wonders for my spirit
8388304 i have been walking all night since i left bellingwood
8388305 i meant no insult usually when you see such a large party traveling the roads they are either a camp of peddlers or people fleeing the wrath of some tyrant or fool or those who travel the roads just because that is their home the road
8388306 if you are on your way to bellingwood with your wagons if you break camp in the next hour or so you should make it by nightfall beware as you approach the last bridge near a stand of very tall trees as that is a spot where highwaymen sometimes lurk you have numbers so it is unlikely they will bother you but be cautious nonetheless
8388307 i am heading to the mountains to wrestle a manticore

8388310 the stranger gave it to me i guess for us having been kind to him
8388311 no doubt he did not want it on him when he reached the mountains as it is said they came smell their own kind and they would have tracked him as prey and enemy

8388313 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8388314 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8388315 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8388316 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8388317 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8388318 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8388319 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8388320 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8388321 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8388322 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8388323 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8388324 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8388325 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8388326 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8388327 who are open to doing something on the production side
8388328 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8388329 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8388330 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8388331 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8388332 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8388333 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8388334 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8388335 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8388366 the super hornet with its small logistics footprint and high mission readiness rates will stand well in the competition since it enhances effective deployment in international operations with the aesa radar now fully onboard the two seat f a 18f is providing unmatched aircrew situational awareness and taking air combat capabilities to new levels as we can now seamlessly execute same time air and ground missions this is truly an aircraft that delivers tomorrows capabilities today
8388367 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8388368 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8388369 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8388386 if hialeah race course doesnt run a meeting in 2003 after failing to open this year 02 it would be in jeopardy of losing its pari mutuel license if the 2003 hialeah race meeting takes place it will run from jan 3 to april 13 dates very similar to gulfstream parks the last time two tracks went head to head in south florida was in 1989 when hialeah and calder raced opposite one another for 27 days before hialeah gave in
8388387 there is a chance hialeah park once considered one of the worlds most beautiful tracks will hold a meeting in 2003 but dont bet your last 2 on it its unlikely because the odds are stacked against such a rebirth

8388398 numerous studies in recent years show that the effects of removal can be long lasting often not showing up fully for a decade of more in one study joseph j doyle an economist with the sloan school of management at m i t found that children removed from their parents and taken into foster care even for a relatively short period were three times as likely to grow up to be juvenile offenders or have a teenage pregnancy than were children from similarly troubled homes who had been left with their parents

8388537 i might have started the fire i just always had this conviction that it was going to be something successful and special it was something we started for all the right reasons
8388538 we wound up with a stack of papers that was the basis of a tv show
8388539 the music just kind of took off on its own
8388540 having been a teacher for 10 years i think a lot of childrens programming doesnt treat kids as socially mentally and emotionally complex as they are
8388541 at the same time its the whimsy and the fun that keeps it entertaining so thats the great white whale to be able to educate and entertain at the same time
8388542 i am proud of when our music can exemplify problem solving skills
8388543 we have recorded over 100 songs i want our music to be something that the 3 year old sister 9 year old brother mom and dad can all enjoy i want our music to be something that reaches the world and stays with kids for life
8388544 we did it here because we had gotten so much support
8388545 but we wound up proving that you could do a production of this scale here this city had the infrastructure and the talent and doing this here helped show that we still do after the storm not every city can and i think its gone really well here

8388763 the briefing note i received is that we do not have a gang issue in our prisons but we do know that we have gangs in our community and if we have a systemic problem in our prisons i look forward this team coming forward with a recommendation addressing that

8388793 my intent for my garden was first and foremost to create a very private space offering a variety of sunny and shady environments

8388796 by the time i found the house in 1996 it consisted of six small rooms with a separate structure on the rear lot line
8388797 my plan was to open up the house and divide it into distinct public and private sections
8388798 i knocked out the wall between the living room and front bedroom and enlarged the opening that housed pocket doors to create a library thus fashioning a large l shaped public space on the opposite side of the house i added a new bathroom and kept the back bedroom and kitchen much as they were when i bought the house

8388800 i have my crew tend to my garden at least twice monthly while i supervise
8388801 i intentionally created shade at the north end next to the back porch to cool and shade the porch and flagstone patio in the hot summer months when the sun is high and intensely hot in the cooler months of the late fall winter and early spring the sun is low and weaker and the trees are leafless and allow the warming rays to stream onto the back porch and at times even enter the glass doors of the kitchen and bedroom

8388904 the problem with deforestation is largely to blame on the government
8388905 that is the government is not committed to some of the basic rules that it itself has put in place to regulate or to ensure that forest is conserved one is the issue that the government is not able to control what we call the annual allocation of companies in timber processing so because government can not monitor people are always cutting beyond what we call the annual allowable cut

8388965 the fact that his campaign co chair is forced to cite barack obamas political ambition as the best example of his experience well it kind of makes our point whether hes opposing an all of the above approach to our energy crisis or proposing job killing tax increases during a down economy barack obama has shown he doesnt have the experience to be ready

8389029 this just goes to show how critically important it is for us in the united states to have a supreme court that is not against those who practice the christian faith but instead understands what the constitution is about and do not engage in outrageous judicial activism

8389034 i thought get over yourself i had literally written out a check to the obama campaign and then i saw him in front of an evangelical group in anaheim
8389035 my partner looked over at me and we tore up the check
8389036 by tearing up his check for obama he basically wrote one to mccain
8389037 i openly no flamingly endorse obama whether he says hes for gay marriage or not i know under obama it will only be a matter of time until the country sees the legalization of gay marriage
8389038 for our gay lesbian bisxexual transgender rights to continue to grow and not further diminish then we need to stand behind obama good luck with your life mr colichman i hope you get to sleep well at night after mccain becomes elected shame on you

8389041 this was apparently marion suge knights girlfriend that was riding with him in his car at the time she started punching him while in the car he was the driver and she was the passenger in an effort to escape she grabbed the steering wheel and steered it to the curb thats when she got out of the car and tried to run and he caught up to her
8389042 every industry has to find a way to change and provide natural options and the funeral business is the next low hanging fruit
8389043 the private cemetery regulations that require things like vaults and grave liners serve no purpose for public health and safety theyre for landscaping management maybe we need to start a lobbying effort
8389044 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8389045 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8389046 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8389047 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8389048 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8389049 thats a ludacris suggestion and given the number of shady characters and organizations that have endorsed barack obama we find it hard to believe the obama campaign has turned down any endorsements at all
8389050 new zealands relations with kiribati have historically been warm and they were greatly enhanced by president anote tongs visit in june for world environment day
8389051 kiribati faces some major sustainability challenges including from overcrowding on tarawa and pressures on its drinking water supply new zealands development assistance to kiribati which will rise to around 32 million over the next five years will help address those challenges

8389084 after much speculation i can confirm that gareth barry will not leave aston villa before the transfer window closes
8389085 gareth made the decision to stay two weeks ago and informed aston villa of his intentions
8389086 during this time discussions have taken place to decide the best way forward for all parties
8389087 any talks regarding potential new contracts at aston villa will not take place until the end of the season
8389088 we are a good fielding side and that is a plus point raina played well but it was disappointing that we both got out together and could not get runs in the end
8389089 you need to put in a more disciplined effort while chasing jayasuriya gave us a good start but we did not back it up thushara has done very well with ball and bat

8389093 on the other hand some action sequences are shot and edited in a way thats impossible to fully follow but everything is underscored with a fascinating subtext that blurs heroism with terrorism and bravery with torture
8389094 bale is grimly humourless as the tortured superhero suave as wayne savage in his costume the gruff voice he assumes as batman is an irritation
8389095 other reservations shouldnt nolan marvellous as his directing here is be creating original films rather than rebooting and retooling franchise fare why cant hollywood put a tenth as much of the craft and vim into its average releases as it does into what is ultimately only a superhero movie
8389096 this big bang finish which includes a topsy turvy image that poignantly suggests the world has been turned on its axis for good is sloppy at times visually incoherent yet touching mr nolan you learn likes to linger in the dark but he doesnt want to live there
8389097 much more serious in intent and message than 2005s batman begins dark knight would be fatally ponderous without ledgers nasty little sprite as it is the movie strains at its own wagnerian seams
8389098 at one point nolan finds himself cutting frenziedly between batman gordon the joker dent rachel and a crazy man in the police cooler and you feel the films sense slipping away between the smoking edits

8389109 sometimes when i watch the premier league i think its becoming what is it becoming does it really mean as much to the people who are playing i think that todays players dont have that same level of emotional attachment to the clubs they represent
8389110 with so much money involved does it mean as much to the individuals in it
8389111 my worry long term is if the premier league becomes a league table of individual wealth for the 20 wealthiest individuals around the world what will that mean
8389112 it wont mean a great deal at all and that will mean we have lost something incredibly precious which is institutions like liverpool that inspire local pride
8389113 clubs have drifted too far from their supporter base in recent times and they need to come back to their roots
8389114 football finances are very fragile and we have seen examples in the past where clubs have overreached themselves and it has had devastating consequences for the supporters more than anybody
8389115 there has been concern in recent times about the way in which some clubs have been taken over the debts are just guaranteed and there isnt a great deal of new money coming into the clubs

8389174 gerade die schulen in problembezirken oder mit einem hohen migranten anteil klagen ber massive einschnitte vor allem beim personal
8389175 einige schulen mussten schon jetzt auf die lehrerfeuerwehr zur ckgreifen um einigerma en gut starten zu k nnen
8389176 wir konnten lediglich nicht alle f cher so besetzen wie wir wollten
8389177 wenn nicht gen gend fachkr fte f r die so wichtigen f cher mathematik physik und sprachkombinationen gefunden wurden dann m ssen einstellungen k nftig eben auch von au en erfolgen

8389180 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8389192 i am sending a fact finding team under mp vinay katiyar to orissa to find out the ground situation there some action has been taken by the state government to control the situation including ordering of a judicial inquiry and suspension of erring officials
8389193 though the bihar government is trying its best the condition there is unimaginably bad the centre should render help on a war footing see more is done than under normal circumstances it should be done within 24 hours

8389217 the union government should clarify an anonymous investment of rs 1 200 crore in airport modernisation and infrastructure by a company called agam spv six ltd based in cayman island in the caribbean islands group
8389218 it is interesting to know that cayman island is a country with a population of 50 000 and has around 80 000 companies registered there this island country is infamous for money laundering drugs and terror funds
8389219 it seems the authorities in india have turned a blind eye to these facts while giving permission for investment in a crucial sector like aviation
8389220 we are protesting against american imperialist policies and will not allow any official of the bush administration on the campus

8389227 his chirajeevis maiden political speech at the temple town of tirupati on tuesday was virtually silent on key issues facing the state it was only a piece of cinematic rhetoric
8389228 there was no clarity on important issues like telangana categorisation of scheduled castes and naxalism he also did not spell out his partys policies and programmes
8389229 in democracy anyone can join politics and launch a party ultimately the people will decide based on your policies and programmes the tdp is always with the people tyring to understand and solve their problems
8389230 he has not stated his partys stand on issues like federalism indo us nuclear deal communal politics and the need for forging a third alternative
8389231 the people of telangana will accept only if he unequivocally supports the demand for separate state we will formulate our position only after he makes his stand clear
8389232 we appreciate his chiranjeevis comments on telangana sentiment and the discrimination that the region has been suffering in all sectors but we want him to make his stand clear on the demand for carving out separate telangana state

8389352 as computer technology continues to advance i like the notion of smart people continuing to apply those advances to take on difficult and challenging societal needs my career and accomplishments are all due to the great education i received my life would have been entirely different had i not had the benefit of my clemson education
8389353 as we strategize our contributions we like to think of approaches that motivate others to give too
8389354 on several occasions we have spearheaded matching funds programs where we match contributions that others give and thus make their contributions go farther its rewarding to see our grants cause a multiplier effect that increases the impact on the important missions of the organizations we support
8389355 tycho is a leader by example always doing first before reaching out to his friends business relationships and the wider community
8389356 he is not only generous but also highly engaged with the mission of our not for profit organization by asking questions to achieve a deeper level of personal understanding he constantly elevates our collective thinking which drives a higher vision of the possibilities we can achieve at childrens when tycho and marie established a challenge grant in 2001 to encourage five figure individual donations none of us realized how successful the program would be and how quickly today due in great part to tychos innovation we now have more than 350 donors making annual donations to childrens of more than 10 000 each
8389357 tycho and maries support of the j paul austin invitational golf tournament serves as a tremendous catalyst to jump start the event each year and is instrumental in helping us reach our goals for the alzheimers association
8389358 with their unwavering support weve raised more than 2 million over the past 14 years their contribution is nothing short of a lifesaver year after year

8389362 as is true with most new products we anticipate we will begin to ramp up production during the quarter as a result and as we have experienced in the past the first quarters sales of the new products will likely be at lower levels than in subsequent quarters the market acceptance of bk5500 that we began to ship in may has been excellent the early signs are that the product will be very successful in the mechanics marketplace we also plan to begin shipping new automated systems products in the first half of fiscal year 2009 that will improve the functionality and performance of our systems these will help us to compete as we continue to address the soft automotive markets that we expect to see in north america and europe we expect sales in north america and europe in fiscal year 2009 to be below fiscal year 2008 levels sales in asia are expected to continue to grow in fiscal year 2009 and offset the decline in north america and europe

8389464 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8389465 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8389466 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8389467 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8389468 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8389469 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8389470 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8389495 odds of treasury stepping in and dealing with fannie mae and freddie mac before the end of this year have been considerably diminished
8389496 its a race between the profits on the portfolios and the losses they are taking on defaults and write downs
8389497 at the same time data is looking like the housing market is near a bottom
8389498 still it will become increasingly difficult for policymakers to ignore the situation as risks of further contraction in the mortgage market are as unpalatable as a high profile bailout

8389503 i regret that judge truitt is unable to serve with us officially
8389504 but he has offered his years of experience and insights into the role of the civic center in the life of our county and he will continue to be a resource at the same time it is imperative to keep the work of the commission on track toward this end i consulted with commission vice chairs orville penn and county councilwoman stevie prettyman and they agreed that mr penn is ideally suited to assume the leadership of the group we are fortunate that ms prettyman will continue as vice chair the next meeting of the wy amp cc commission will be on september 3rd at 11 00 a m in flanders 6 at the civic center

8389525 a recent poll says that bush has a 24 approval rating
8389526 according to a recent poll republican candidate john mccain and democratic candidate barrack obama each have the support of about 50 of the voting public
8389527 i believe that as democrats and americans united you are to be given the respect and recognition that you deserve as delegates
8389528 i have spoken to many of you and you have questions about what to do you want to vote according to what is in your heart i am not going to tell you what to do you have come from different places and made a long journey
8389529 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8389530 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8389531 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8389532 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match and be able to win even when you feel tired
8389533 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8389534 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8389535 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8389536 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8389537 the practice principal at redlands veterinary clinic will be provided with a copy of your complaint and asked for a response to the concerns you have raised as to the hygiene standards of the practice as observed by you
8389538 we would probably carry out 3 500 different procedures or interactions with horses each year and id be surprised if we had 20 or 30 problems and infections so i think the success rate we have is remarkable

8389541 senator clinton made me so proud to work for her and so proud to be a democrat
8389542 on behalf of the clinton delegation i would like to thank everyone for being respectful of the process
8389543 i wish she could have been a better loser but im just glad shes a democrat and on our side
8389544 but now she says we got to throw our support behind obama and people get that
8389545 hi this is tom husband chairman of your maricopa county republican party with an important message
8389546 gop county chairman urges election of rep sam crump and carl seel
8389547 for us its about trying to create pressure around that lineout and the two key guys are the thrower and the caller so if you can create pressure for them to operate under its going to be more difficult
8389548 their decision making becomes a lot less accurate and that doesnt necessarily just apply to south africa thats at any time
8389549 i just thought through the level of accuracy the guys were able to put into it they were able to create a pressure situation where guys who are very very good made errors and thats what youre aiming for every week
8389550 the guys did a particularly good job probably one of our better performances against south africa in the last couple of years theres no doubt
8389551 lock matfield takes a lot of pride in the lineout and hes their captain now and that probably says it all
8389552 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8389553 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8389554 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one

8389560 the editor of newsweek jon meacham said he had not read the manuscript but he offered a reason why the media might be silent i think theres a kind of bush bashing fatigue out there
8389561 if you say our young men didnt die for bush cheney and rove then whom did they die for
8389562 what i strongly believe without absolutely knowing is that this man has no respect or love for this country
8389563 i dont know about you but if i ever killed just one person even accidentally like in a car accident id never have another perfect day as long as i lived
8389564 bushs alleged crime is on such a grand scale that it would greatly dishonor those who paid the ultimate price because of it if he were not to pay the ultimate penalty
8389565 very credible argument could be made that in a real sense he did intend to have american soldiers killed in his war
8389566 not only didnt the defendant intend to kill but he had no way of knowing whether someone would die or not but while bush never specifically intended to kill any american soldier he absolutely knew american soldiers would necessarily die in his war
8389567 therefore a case could be made that unless bush intended to have a war without any casualties which is an argument that would make bush sound absurd he did in fact specifically intend to have american soldiers killed
8389568 as a former prosecutor with twenty one murder convictions without a loss i am probably in a better position than the average person to know what type of evidence is necessary to go to trial with
8389569 i didnt have time to write a short letter so ive written a long one instead
8389570 it would greatly dishonor those in their graves who paid the ultimate price because of this war were you not to refer this case to the department of justice
8389571 when i get out of law school im going to become a d a or state attorney general and im going to bring charges against bush
8389572 mr bugliosi i read your book we havent lost any citizens from my county in the war in iraq but if we lose a soldier im going to run for d a in the county if i win im going to prosecute bush
8389573 mr president theres this prosecutor up in fargo north dakota sir hes prosecuting you for murder and were due in fargo at 10 a m tuesday for your arraignment
8389574 i strongly believe without absolutely knowing that this man has no respect or love for this country
8389575 i dont know about you but if i ever killed just one person even accidentally like in a car accident id never have another perfect day as long as i live
8389576 what you can steal a presidential election and all that happens is you lose respect
8389577 tim dont worry were not going to hurt you were not goanna prosecute you but you know tim we dont like you youre a terrible person
8389578 he was just found not guilty how can you accuse him of murder on the cover of a book
8389579 let him sue me for libel id love to cross examine him
8389580 mr bugliosi you cant do this because it would inhibit future presidents
8389581 if theres another monstrous individual like bush whos thinking about doing what did we do want to inhibit him
8389582 vince i cannot find an audio company in america that will do the audio for the book
8389583 there is one aspect of invocation that must be reiterated the difference between expulsion of the demonic and invocation of the daimonic the invocation of devic or celestial influences implies the expulsion of the lower bestial or demonic creatures which ordinarily inhabit the mind of man the demons of desire and hatred each time we manifest desire or aversion we are bringing to life signing a pact with one of the demons of ego

8389752 blue waters will be an unrivaled national asset that will have a powerful impact on both science and society
8389753 scientists around the country simulating new medicines or materials the weather disease outbreaks or complex engineered systems like power plants and aircraft are poised to make discoveries that we can only begin to imagine
8389754 our community traditionally uses peak performance to measure the output of a system based on simple benchmarks its a measure thats never achieved in real life
8389755 with blue waters were focused intently on sustained performance genuine performance on codes that scientists and engineers use every day instead of unattainable benchmark figures
8389756 a system with a large amount of globally addressable memory might come in at two terabytes of memory blue waters will have 500 times that this configuration makes blue waters a unique resource for the most compute memory and data intensive applications handling data in this way means a broad range of researchers can get all of their work done in one place and dont have to move among different machines with specialized architectures
8389757 our relationship with illinois ncsa and their partners throughout the country will help deliver an extraordinary new system
8389758 the work to come on blue waters will usher in a new era in supercomputing ultimately providing a powerful new platform for scientists engineers and commercial users
8389759 for decades the university of illinois at urbana champaign has been a leader in high performance computing the blue waters project is the latest in our rich tradition of innovation

8389821 i would have a very different opinion of tivo if its primary goal was to sell set top boxes
8389822 if that was their strategy id be quite negative but the company has been shifting its business strategy and we think theres enough runway left for them to start penetrating cable operators

8389839 we have been unhappy with microsoft for some time before the release of exchange 2007 which included voip voice over internet protocol in its unified messaging suite it was time to offer our customers an alternative
8389840 if you think about what were going to do we usually acquire when we move into new markets that we do not have the expertise for the product segments in
8389841 once again cisco makes a sound investment in an email technology vendor just like it did with
8389842 these are the clever guys who reverse engineered the exchange client protocol mapi rpc and the related on the wire details needed to make a vanilla install of outlook talk to a non exchange mail server with full fidelity impressive stuff of all the other exchange alternatives postpath has the most interesting architecture and i say that as one who has years emotionally invested in the openmail technology
8389843 i think cisco fell out of love with microsoft a while back something to do with voip support in exchange and how cisco thought it was microsofts partner but it turned out that microsoft was competing with them nothing familiar there at all
8389844 sounds like cisco wants to offer saas collaboration based on postpath and webex whoever said the email world has become dull and uninteresting
8389845 giving up meat could drastically reduce your carbon footprint with
8389846 but the food a vegetarian consumes in 12 months is responsible for generating the same emissions as driving 2 427 kilometres going vegan giving up meat and dairy products would cut the emissions released in making what you eat more than seven fold to the equivalent of driving 629 kilometres

8389849 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process that in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8389850 at the end of the day the israeli government policy is not to expand settlements its not to build new settlements not to confiscate land from palestinians and according to my knowledge settlement activities reduced in the most dramatic way especially in parts which are on the other side of the fence there were some small activities that are not going to influence inaudible nor the future borders of the palestinian state
8389851 theres nothing to prevent strengthening settlement blocs that in the end of the day in a peace agreement will clearly be in israels hands

8389889 that 80 to 90 of learning occurs informally outside of the classroom this should be shocking enough to force some sort of change in e learning design but it hasnt at least not yet in any significant way

8389941 he will not play in the game but hes right on schedule
8389942 he threw he did his warm up and got in the individual period and the ballhandling and he threw routes versus and threw some one on one
8389943 he threw very well and moved around and did fine
8389944 theyve gone through a lot and he manning has hes worked and hes doing well
8389945 we have a limited amount of work for him to do today wednesday hell get some work game day actually we have a number of guys who are going to do the same thing work out but probably not play
8389946 hell get some work in then so far so good but everythings on schedule

8389952 i have been working on the endangered species act for 15 years and have never seen such a sneaky attack
8389953 with this change the bush administration threatens to undo more than 30 years of progress
8389954 this move is consistent with other efforts by the administration to cement industry friendly policies before leaving office in january
8389955 there is nothing that allows an agency of the federal government to not obey the endangered species act and the agencies are liable under civil and criminal penalties if they do not obey
8389956 proposed rule is consistent with the fws fish and wildlife service current understanding it is not possible to draw a direct causal link
8389957 it takes great hubris to resurrect an issue the court has already definitely struck down
8389958 this is like a zombie movie their proposal to toss the endangered species act over the cliff died but now has somehow come back to life
8389959 this is akin to a drug company suppressing results showing that a medicine is killing people and then trying to put the medicine broadly on the market
8389960 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
8389961 after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it

8389970 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8389971 since it is against the law in mississippi for illegal immigrants to accept jobs and it is illegal to be in the country without a proper visa i would say that these individuals fit the definition of criminals that being said how can they honestly be surprised that they would be treated as such they knew they were breaking laws they knew the potential consequences of their actions they accepted that risk and got caught
8389972 sometime during the early morning hours a person threw a big rock through one of the windows

8389976 as i passed through layer after layer of steel doors i was hit hard by a presence of a genuine darkness but even more distinct from this feeling was how god was remaining present to me in the midst of all that darkness when i arrived at the destination for the visit a 6 by 10 room used for attorney meetings and pastoral visits i looked searchingly through the thick safety glass sitting behind the glass was a man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who looked closely at me and smiled i wondered apprehensively where this would all lead
8389977 may the peace of christ be with you today i received my new scripture studies from little rock scripture study they look very interesting especially parables of the kingdom i always praise god for all the blessings and being able to study his word is always real high on my list
8389978 my journey has been an adventure and continues to be your fellowship has helped a great deal
8389979 things seem to fall into place when im calm and at peace another learning experience that i am very grateful for
8389980 for now things are going well for me thanks to the many blessings some of which i have yet to recognize on the streets id probably be dead by now so even being in prison could be a blessing i make no judgments and leave it all up to my lord and savior jesus christ
