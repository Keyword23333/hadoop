6360003 releasing such allegations to the media at this time could prove detrimental to the critical preparations of the other three boxers who will be contesting to reach the final of the boxing competition tomorrow
6360004 i am so sad that this has been been raised to distract and unsettle me the coaching team and more importantly my boxers ahead of the most important bouts of their lives

6360013 increased corruption devastated the economy and led ghanaians to wallow in extreme poverty
6360014 this is our last hope and if we refuse to vote the npp out of power we would all continue to wallow in abject poverty

6360029 our investigations have revealed that every school pupil at the basic level fully pays for his school uniform which constitutes according to the ghana living standards survey glss 1995 17 per pent of household expenditure on education
6360030 one whole academic year after the introduction of the reform neither the syllabus nor a single textbook is available to students
6360031 which is more important to the government than quality of the education to be provided
6360032 my goal was to continue to work and not let them tell me rockys going to come back faster
6360033 that just wasnt going to happen to me after working hard and seeing how my knee was feeling out here i knew i could get back
6360034 it think its a real tribute to them and any player thats had to go through a severe injury the long road back way back in february when they were trying to motivate each other i think it was hard to visualize what it will be like when you finally do get back and now theyre realizing it
6360035 but just us having the same injuries we were out there trying to work hard compete against each other and so far so good
6360036 as a corner i think the sleeve will hold me back
6360037 if its going to swell up its going to swell up with or without the sleeve the sleeve aint going to stop somebody from hitting me im just going to go out there like ive never had anything wrong
6360038 i couldve been to the pro bowl instead of dropping about 10 picks

6360042 jazz on the grass is a wonderful opportunity for those who share the foundations commitment to opportunity through education to come together for an exciting and memorable afternoon of electrifying entertainment and fellowship

6360044 lynne and i are thrilled to open our home for this fantastic occasion we are delighted to be able to further the foundations mission of developing future leaders who will carry on jackie robinsons values and ideals
6360045 the running mate must be able to get along well with the flag bearer he should also be hardworking and be able to execute tasks with a sense of urgency
6360046 when we decided to do this event a primary reason was that we wanted to make the hands on learning that we do at the museum available to a broad range of the community that might not choose to come to the museum
6360047 it was a way for us to demonstrate what we do
6360048 its a struggle for us to stay open actually because the event requires all of our staff down at the plaza
6360049 the staff tells us that its not uncommon for visitors to say they got excited about something at sand in the city and came to the museum
6360050 weve been getting e mails from people from different states saying they are planning their visit to coincide with the event
6360051 people want to make sure they have the right dates and they want to know what else is happening in the community a family like that definitely will want to take in the museum in addition to the event
6360052 so it will be fun for them to have even more to look at
6360053 weve given them the design of the new childrens museum and theyre going to create their version of that in sand
6360054 were going to have a booth that has an activity for children to create ideas
6360055 were doing drawings and we might do clay sculptures with modeling clay
6360056 one of the areas weve been researching is the connection between the native americans of the pacific northwest and the water so in the global village we are doing native american art
6360057 i have been telling our activists wherever that i went not to tolerate such a thing it constitutes abuse of the law
6360058 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6360059 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6360060 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6360061 the effect of grapefruit juice on some medicines is well established and where this applies it is clearly detailed in patient information leaflets
6360062 pharmacists will usually draw this matter to patients attention when dispensing their medicines this new research showing that apple and orange juice may enhance or reduce the effects of some medicines is interesting but it is only one study
6360063 usually further research is needed to establish that these interactions are significant
6360064 its not a farce but there are farcical elements to it
6360065 it has a very similar sense of humor to those two films its definitely an unusual sense of humor shanley writes really delightful funny ways of people speaking their minds
6360066 the title on the one hand is unfortunate because it sounds like something disturbed and disturbing but on the other hand when you see the play you realize its the perfect title
6360067 it really is a delightful comedy very witty its so buoyant and joyful and adorable
6360068 we have to get past the name to find an audience
6360069 its about a guy who has this secret and dont we all about his sex life
6360070 he tells his best friend his secret in hopes of getting some help and one secret leads to another its really about how does love last if we knew the truth about everybody wed never even try
6360071 the meat of the play is just really beautiful stuff one of the big ideas in the play is that everybody has something youre not going to like why keep moving on and on why not just accept that about that person and just stick it out
6360072 you have the play you have the words then you pick the people
6360073 the central region is one of the poorest regions in the country so any message that will win the electorates should be one that will uplift them from the doldrums of poverty
6360074 i had recently stumbled upon many websites with gorgeous gigantic
6360075 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6360076 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6360077 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win
6360078 college guys talk about what theyre reading what they read in high school and what books are important to them now
6360079 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6360080 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6360084 the new more productive higher paying jobs are coming and we plan to make you ready for them
6360085 africa is perhaps the only continent whose people trade so little amongst ourselves and we must reverse that my government will work with other countries to reduce tariffs harmonise rail gauges and truck axles so that we can increase intra african trade
6360086 the purpose of our party is to manifest our faith in our country and her people by helping to make ghanaians winners in the global village able to compete effectively with their counterparts from all corners of the globe
6360087 the modernisation and development of agriculture will be pursued to increase incomes for farmers and keep food prices down for the whole population nana akufo addo outlined how this would be achieved through the provision of the latest higher yielding seeds and new machinery combined with investment in irrigation and storage facilities furthermore a us 1 billion northern development fund would transform farming in the north the next npp government would also develop booming agro processing industries both to add value to the nations agricultural products and generate a significant numbers of jobs supported by the us 1 billion industrial development fund jobs would also be created through the expansion of the energy aluminium and limestone industries
6360088 investment in housing and road building would therefore be pursued for the benefit all ghanaians whilst also creating hundreds of thousands of jobs workers in the informal sector would not only be encouraged to expand and upgrade their businesses through micro credit schemes certification programmes technical assistance and skills upgrade programmes
6360089 how fair would it be if consultants who are supposed to negotiate these agreements on our behalf are paid by the eu our negotiating partners
6360090 the epas are fundamentally an extension of the same neo liberal policies africa and other developing regions have been coerced to adopt in the last three decades
6360091 indeed the roots of a thriving democracy are to be found in peace stability law and order as well as compliance by all stakeholders with well defined electoral laws and codes
6360092 it was on the strength of this that the iea under the auspices of the ghana political parties programme gppp organised a workshop to review the 2004 code of conduct to make it relevant to the demands of the 2008 general election
6360093 we are of the conviction that political actors would respect and adhere to the provisions of the code in order to safeguard the relative peace and tranquility of our dear country
6360094 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6360095 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6360096 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6360097 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure

6360101 the banks must be strong and competent enough to mobilise both domestic and foreign capital to support the development projects businesses and objectives of the state and the people
6360102 they must prove to be good corporate citizens of ghana
6360103 it also means its our turn to be as corrupt and irresponsible to the democratic process as their white predecessors have been
6360104 i recall john f kennedy president of the united states when he became president he recommended his brother right
6360105 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6360106 it is unrealistic to expect the government to rescue themarket
6360107 speculators should be very cautious now the worst isnot over in the global credit crisis
6360108 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6360135 after encountering a number of forced marriages among her constituents she mounted a brave campaign to highlight the sometimes appalling mistreatment of women forced to be brides
6360136 my campaigns on behalf of some of our most vulnerable people are coming to fruition the forced marriage civil protection act comes into effect in september
6360137 this act along with new immigration rules i have been calling for will help many young women and to a lesser extent men to have a greater say in the conduct of their own lives

6360139 questa ricerca rappresenta un passo potenzialmente pericoloso in avanti nel rapporto costo efficacia nella trasformazione di questi importanti materiali
6360140 tale forma di particelle si riveler utile nel trattamento dei magneti anisotropici che sono molto ricercati in molte applicazioni commerciali e governative militari obiettivo naturalmente quello di realizzare un materiale pi energeticamente efficiente e pi leggero
6360141 i ricercatori hanno segnato una nuova pietra miliare per aumentare il potenziale e ridurre la complessit dei costi di trasformazione del samario cobalto e dei magneti permanenti utilizzati in molti dod e sistemi avanzati militari
6360142 lo sviluppo stabile delle nanoparticelle di samario cobalto utilizzando questo metodo pu motivare un maggior numero di scienziati e ingegneri a lavorare per lo sviluppo della prossima generazione di magneti
6360143 questo lavoro rappresenta le pi promettenti anticipazioni nel campo dei magneti permanenti dei prossimi anni e sicuramente del prossimo futuro
6360144 i dont know why it had not been found earlier it may have been snagged it may have been underwater for a period of time and recent rains just brought it to the surface
6360145 its a very sad ending unfortunately hes been missing for two weeks so it was an ending that was probably to be expected
6360146 it looked like a dummy but i touched his ear it felt soft and not hard like a dummy so i knew
6360147 its not very nice not when youve got kids of your own
6360148 i just hope that it was an accident and he fell in and no rats killed him
6360149 at least now hes been found they can do something about it and start living now they have got the boy back

6360152 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6360153 immediately we launched into playing songs to each other on the phone
6360154 we were on the phone for a couple of hours we knew there was something special

6360159 we shared a house in los angeles and in the evenings we would blow off steam playing other peoples songs
6360160 tommy would throw a harmony on or i would throw a harmony on eventually we started saying hey lets write some songs at that point wed been really good friends for eight years and listening to the same music and loving the same music it started pouring out very freely he would say a line and then i would say a line
6360161 we wrote for about a year before we played our first show
6360162 alexi is a friend of ours he came to our house and sat down and listened and loved it so much he invited us to open two of his shows the following week

6360168 but i have got to take the good from these championships

6360172 for a guy like michael phelps who isnt worried about obesity because hes burning thousands of calories as an athlete eating corn flakes and frosted flakes every so often is not an issue
6360173 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
6360174 i recall john telling that story when we first got together in 1971 when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison
6360175 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories
6360176 there were several stories similar to that in which guards a very few i might add showed compassion to the prisoners it was rare and i never met one but some of the guys did

6360178 i dont think we should expect a transformational change in the next few years as i said it may take a generation or two generations or three generations but i believe as long as we can improve in our behaviours and our courtesy bit by bit each day i think thats good enough
6360179 im just frightened if you nearly walked out under a bus how would you feel thats the kind of fear i feel death scares me but we all have a certain amount of time to live we all have to go sometime its a killer disease and i dont know if i can beat this or not
6360180 im not angry im just frightened i heard she was dying as regards her way of dealing with cancer im not a judge everyone has their own way of dealing with things thats her way of dealing with things each to their own
6360181 my initial reaction was terror there you are going oh jesus you cant prepare for something like this it comes as a shock but you just hope for the best and that the treatment cures you and if it doesnt well thats that
6360182 i was upset because i had my beard for so long and when it started falling out i shaved it off i thought i looked like dracula with pointy ears i was first diagnosed october 12 months ago and ive had a lot to go through since then
6360183 it was a terrible blow when it came as time goes on you dont get over these things but you have to try and live with them as best you can and try and live for other people so i am doing the best i can
6360184 its not so raw now but its still there the loss
6360185 she would have wished me to carry on she was such a brave woman i would seem like a wimp if i did not keep going as best i can
6360186 at the moment i just dont give a fiddlers f about records im not particularly worried about making more records or anything else i just want to stay alive im not really listening to music every day either unless i just happen to hear it
6360187 i dont know its a killer disease but it wont be me who beats it it will be the surgeons and nurses and the doctors not me
6360188 i havent an idea about how much money it raised yet but im delighted it happened i thought the whole thing was great sitting there watching it being performed on the late late show was absolutely marvellous as well as being extremely gratifying
6360189 mind you i didnt know about the ballad of ronnie drew until bono came out to my house in greystones to play me the song
6360190 theyre still there for me and i still meet them they call and keep in touch to see how im doing theyre great people who have been wonderful to me
6360191 i dont know what way theyre going to treat me at the moment its an ongoing thing where you take the treatment and hope for the best
6360192 how is it possible that officials didnt know there had been a technical mistake
6360193 the us have the right to protest but why when officials disqualified spearmon did they not notice churandys violation
6360194 i dont understand it if i stood on the line then why did the jury not disqualify me at the same time as spearmon it was at least 90 minutes before they told me i was disqualified
6360195 we recognise that the race footage indicates a technical mistake we will examine however whether the rules make it possible to disqualify an athlete in this way
6360196 its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement
6360197 the 1000m was always the one i was more focused on wallace said
6360198 i never really focused on it 500m too much but now ive had a couple of really good 500m races
6360199 it kind of makes you think i may as well tackle it while im here im not here to bake cookies
6360200 the legs started to blow up in the last 100 metres and once your legs go your body starts to cramp up pretty tight and youve just got to try and hold on till the end wallace said
6360201 i dont know if it was the rain but normally we ride down to the course so the legs get a good warm up
6360202 even though we had all day i dont think i was really prepared for that race
6360203 i think tomorrow and the next day ill definitly have my race head on me
6360204 i was probably more nervous yesterday leading into the 1000 wallace said
6360205 today i was pretty relaxed and that was probably the problem i was a little bit too relaxed
6360206 ive been told that i have to start getting my race head on because sometimes im too fun loving
6360207 but i wouldnt do this sport if i wasnt having fun its not exactly the most interesting sport going round especially for spectators unless youre watching finals

6360209 there has been a deterioration in the whales condition over the last couple of hours
6360210 weve decided it is in the best interests of the whale that it is put down

6360237 he should shake hands with them after the finish line however he is only 21 and he will learn i have no problems with his showboating prior to the race but a shake of the hand or a tap on the shoulder immediately after the race would be a good gesture

6360271 with the tremendous popularity of video on demand services such as youtube we believe that the opportunity for telecoms operators to offer value added services will drive the growth of paid tv revenues as consumers increase the demand to access content regardless of time location or type of device
6360272 we believe telecoms providers have the technical capability and available routes to market to take advantage of opportunities to develop this service over the next two years and even earlier in certain markets at the moment the opportunity still exists for telecoms providers to get a foothold in the content market but the case will not remain this way indefinitely
6360273 moving quickly is critical to outdoing the increasing competition from both cable operators and web players but should they act now telecoms operators will avoid being reduced to pure access providers

6360288 i have no way of knowing if washington expected the georgian military to collapse under the russian onslaught as quickly and completely as it did since the georgia gambit was planned by the same strategic geniuses who assured us that american occupation forces in iraq would be greeted with candy and flowers i suspect the result was an unpleasant surprise while neither side in this conflict is entirely clean it was the post soviet russian military that acted with professionalism efficiency and for the most part proportionality it was the georgian forces trained and equipped by the proto soviet regime in washington that committed an act of undisguised aggression and when stymied by a superior force channeled its murderous rage into attacks on innocent civilians

6360301 an improvement of over eight percent in southern california is welcome news and hopefully the start of an upward trend
6360302 however riverside and los angeles counties continue to be major contributors to the 120 percent jump from last year
6360303 the housing market indicators show a declining inventory of homes for sale but the median home values also continue to decline
6360304 many areas have seen home values fall over 30 percent since the middle of 2006 during the housing boom without a short sale or a few other options it is nearly impossible to sell a home that was overly leveraged
6360305 again we are always pleased to see an improvement in the foreclosure situation even if it is just a month to month adjustment
6360306 although southern california was hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis the northern part of the state has also been significantly affected but not as much in san francisco even in san francisco though median home prices have declined
6360307 the region has seen prices fall approximately 20 to 25 percent since the middle of 2006
6360308 however median home prices and inventories in northern california have begun to level off in the past few months

6360316 lecturers are faced with the challenge of creating a massive volume of materials for their courses in a very short period of time
6360317 they only have a few weeks each semester in which to create an entire course curriculum complete with lecture notes class materials and student exercises this is a very intensive task for which there are very few aids in the market by releasing a free 7 day trial of the educational version of mpmm we can help lecturers to gain all of the materials they need to perform this task quickly and easily the materials are structured so that each project management topic is described separately in depth so a lecturer can pick up the materials and use them to plan their courses much more easily
6360318 the educational version also helps students to pass their courses it gives them all of the materials they need to study the project management topic to an advanced level they can start with a summary of the steps taken to deliver a project and then move on to more advanced topics such as risk management project planning and project execution

6360320 the downside is that the costs dont fall proportionately with the hours
6360321 when we didnt have enough money coming in to take care of the payroll we knew that we had to do something at this end to cut the overhead
6360322 the insurance still goes on the electric still goes on but the payroll was what was killing us

6360326 its good for the economy here because these people do have a job to go back to
6360327 doesnt always work out but in a large number of cases weve seen that it has
6360328 the downside is that the costs dont fall proportionately with the hours

6360341 the bank is willing to do a short sale and we have an offer of 170 000 on the house but we believe the bank will turn that down
6360342 they hand over their keys and walk away from the homes
6360343 it takes time for people to recognize that these losses are real

6360369 i felt we linked up well and both of us could have been on the scoresheet
6360370 if we get the nod in a couple of weeks hopefully it will get better
6360371 but it was good preparation for the big one in the couple of weeks time
6360372 we were able to blood one or two new players we had a look at some partnerships passed it quite well at times
6360373 it was just a little bit of the cutting edge we had one or two opportunities and youre looking to take them
6360374 for a player its always hard to say when but i think the time is right for me now to make the ultimate decision
6360375 we have some great players coming through here players like sam burgess andy lynch and koppy craig kopczak and i just feel the time is right to hang up my boots and enjoy the game from the sidelines
6360376 joe has probably been up there with robbie paul as the most significant overseas signing the club has ever made
6360377 in terms of overall contributions to the club both on and off the field his presence is simply immense and there will be a whole host of players who will be glad to see the back of joe vagana so they dont have to play against him
6360378 he will be a great loss to the club on the field and also off it because of the shear amount of work he has done for the club in that area
6360379 injuries have ripped the heart out of what we have been doing
6360380 we do not have too many alternatives the system we had planned and worked on is now giving us problems
6360381 we had been working on a system that was looking good but then we have had bad injuries to james collins danny gabbidon and lewin nyatanga and we have got to virtually start again
6360382 we have had a bad day at the office on two fronts i am very disappointed with the manner of the defeat and the goals we conceded were just schoolboy mistakes
6360383 in the first half we played some very good football and could have been further in the lead
6360384 our football certainly deserved more of a reward but we lacked a cutting edge in the second period
6360385 you know that you are on the front line in the fight against the taliban you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6360386 as a result of the talks at acas between the unions and swissport we have a new improved offer to put to our members
6360387 because of the improved offer all planned industrial action is suspended until we get the reaction of the members
6360388 this does not affect the industrial action for the scanner workers who are employed by airport services
6360389 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6360390 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6360391 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6360392 im convinced that in fabio capello the england team has the right manager and a genuine chance of success

6360399 client requirements for civils staff remain strong because order books are still full it is one of the key areas which is managing to successfully buck the downward trends which other sectors are facing due to the credit crunch given that there is such a shortage of qualified engineers in general anyway we can certainly say with confidence that good workers will remain in demand

6360409 julys robust rise in retail sales should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6360410 we suspect that the official figures are still giving an overly upbeat picture nonetheless there is clearly still a risk that consumer demand remains resilient enough for retailers to try pass on more of their rises in costs to consumers continuing the upward trend in inflation

6360413 kut hoe laat is het moet ik werken vandaag heb ik iets afgesproken
6360414 todays partnering agreement secures the long term supply of ammunitions to our armed forces
6360415 the 15 year programme will ensure that the uk has a modernised sustainable munitions industry which will support british jobs and protect our capacity to produce ammunition
6360416 it is absolutely essential to the conduct of operations and training that we have a guaranteed uk based high quality source of ammunition this contract provides precisely that
6360417 you can imagine that the rate of production that we are now at its been some achievement to keep that going in that period to make sure that we deliver on time
6360418 outraged and far more aware of baes influence among government
6360419 all of the chamber of commerce presidents are in the alliance and amity was not represented so that is one of the main reasons we formed we also want to market the area we havent done a good job of that in the past
6360420 so we want to show people what a wonderful place amity is we have everything here that a family would need
6360421 i am originally from the area so i know everyone around here and i own a business here too people know that i want to help the community and businesses prosper
6360422 i want the entire state to know where amity is located
6360423 the event is at city hall from 9 a m to 9 p m and its free for anyone who wants to come several church groups from around the area will sing
6360424 its going to be a great time for community fellowship
6360425 since we are part of the economic alliance we got to voice our opinion and vote on hiring paul harvel as president
6360426 we think he is going to do a great job
6360427 we are working in conjunction with the centerpoint high school environmental and spatial technology east lab to make a web site for the chamber once school starts the students will begin takingpictures of our businesses and events
6360428 so now when someone searches for amity on the internet they can go to one place with maps pictures and information
6360429 we had businesses wanting to join before we were ever really organized im very proud at how the people of amity have come together to begin this project
6360430 this is going to be great for our community and i think something great is going to come out of this
6360431 im real pleased with how things are going for us
6360432 the offense and defense will be totally different and theyre picking it up
6360433 its just a matter of how well we play this year
6360434 generally its just to give the citizens a better understanding of what we do and why we do some of thethings we do
6360435 the goal is to have a better understanding between the police and the citizens of jacksonville it helps them know what we need in certain situations like when were investigating a crime and how to be a good witness
6360436 edu cated citizens will be more supportive of police officers and the department and will be more productive within their own neighborhoods and communities
6360437 i think those guys our policemen do an awesome job
6360438 i want to see firsthand just what they go through so i can see their needs and know how to help make sure jacksonville stays on the cutting edge as far as technology and their needs go
6360439 i like to know whats going on with our police and try to help them out in any way i can
6360440 i think weve got a good police chief gary sipes on board whos going to work to make some improvements injacksonville and i want to know whatever ways there are to help them do that i want to find out what their needs are and hopefully get some useful information that i can relay back to the people of jacksonville
6360441 basically what theyre going to teach is what they do
6360442 sometimes people think were the police and we can do whatever we want
6360443 they dont understand sometimes why we cant we have certain limitations and well help them understand what we can and cant do
6360444 dont eat it right away it needs to sit for 24 hours so the flavors can develop and dont put it in the refrigerator
6360445 people defend their own cheese like they defend their favorite pizzeria
6360446 im from south australia and i understand what its like to live at this end of the river and as ive said those people who live downstream are understandably pretty unhappy about what happens upstream
6360447 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6360448 the murray lakes and coorong wetlands cannot be allowed to die
6360449 its not right that you have one part of the river system that is in virtual flood and the other part that is going to die
6360450 the fact is the lions share of water taken from the murray darling basin every year is taken by nsw victoria and south australia
6360451 after seeing sharp falls in the last few weeks gold and platinum are supported as we are starting to see some bargain hunting from end users
6360452 falls from here would be limited but we have to see how the euro behaves against the dollar from here another decline in the euro would drag precious metals and other commodities along
6360453 volume remains very thin because most people are on vacation i suspect we might have already seen a short term low of 773
6360454 so it just plays with the range for the time being
6360455 i think its a bit oversold earlier on but i dont think it could bounce back to the 1 500 1 600 areas its quite difficult so its still consolidating for the time being
6360456 there are renewed concerns regarding the financial sector and some other investment banks are also grabbing the headlines so the dollar is seeing a corrective pullback
6360457 one of the characteristics of this dollar move so far is that there hasnt been a correction
6360458 going forward we view recent gains in the us dollar as sustainable against the backdrop of housing market related concerns worsening growth expectations outside the us the outlook for yields soft commodity prices and strong capital flows are all dollar supportive
6360459 theres a myriad of geopolitical factors rumbling in the background russia iran
6360460 as prices drop saudi arabia may cut back on its recent increase in production which could halt the most recent price decline
6360461 they will still be charged and evidence will still be gathered against them
6360462 but the prosecutors will determine if they can become state witnesses
6360463 even as the government forces hunt down the milf terrorists who perpetrated crimes and destruction upon hapless civilians as well as soldiers in mindanao we cannot ignore the loss of these victims
6360464 while no amount of compensation can mitigate the sorrow of our citizens who themselves or their loved ones became victims of violent crimes perpetrated by these rebels our government will find ways to recompense or at least mitigate the economic aspect of said loss
6360465 the best option is to plan ahead and parents who wish to avoid taking a loan or having to juggle other financial priorities to fund their childs education should really consider a dedicated educational savings plan to lighten the financial burden
6360466 this database cannot and should not be used in california or elsewhere to decide whether or not a person is dangerous or should be detained
6360467 shall be distributed to assist counties for the expense of housing juvenile offenders
6360468 criminologists warn that juvenile offenders who are thrown in with adult prisoners are exposed to social pressures and develop personal contacts that make it far more likely that they will become career criminals than those held in juvenile facilities

6360471 it wouldve been a bonus if jason was available because of the quality player he is but we havent had him the last couple of weeks
6360472 with the type of football were playing at the moment it would be good to have a player like that but weve been managing without him
6360473 i heard about that yesterday but im under contract for the next couple of years so yeah thats all i can say to it
6360474 on launch customers will not be able to buy content from the itunes store however they will be able to buy applications from the apple application store
6360475 it may work but you may not enjoy the same iphone experience as singtel only supports iphone 3g devices that are connected to singtels network
6360476 people have been forced to become system integrators to figure out which parts of their systems are bad we actually take a look at all the technology in the office including pcs routers usb devices wi fi and peripherals the goal of our service is to keep everything working
6360477 a large amount of money that could have been spent on frontline care will have simply been poured down the drain
6360478 do more to tackle public health problems and focus on issues such as lifestyle obesity coronary heart disease and diabetes
6360479 prescribing medicines which are helping people manage their chronic conditions and keeping them out of hospital reducing the cost and pressure on the national health service nhs
6360480 we are also issuing more medicines used to treat cancers as cancer therapy has improved to a point where for a number of patients it is now a chronic condition plus gps are helping more patients with diabetes manage their condition under the new enhanced contract
6360481 it does not surprise us to see further evidence of asa404s activity in prostate cancer
6360482 with its unique mode of action as a tumour vascular disrupting agent asa404 has potential against a variety of solid tumours
6360483 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6360484 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6360485 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6360486 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6360487 the results clearly reflect the changing role of community pharmacy in scotland
6360488 people are recognising that pharmacists can provide a whole range of health services information and advice
6360489 pharmacies have undergone a major change over the last few years
6360490 just over three quarters of all community pharmacies now have private consulting rooms making it easier for people to feel comfortable talking about more personal issues
6360491 pharmacy has a real role to play in making healthcare more accessible in the community and ease the pressure on the national health service nhs
6360492 we can and must do more this government inherited a long overdue target to bring down waiting times
6360493 very close to meeting the demanding 62 day target which has proved particularly challenging for them but i now want boards to make one last push which will enable us not only to meet the target but to sustain that level of service in addition we are currently updating our cancer strategy which will be published soon
6360494 for 26 years in washington john mccain s played the same old games we just can t afford more of the same
6360495 mr ayers was a leader of the weather underground a terrorist group responsible for countless bombings against targets including the u s capitol the pentagon and numerous police stations courthouses and banks
6360496 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
6360497 both mccain and obama opposed offshore drilling when the campaign began
6360498 it worked well but we think we can make it work better
6360499 the core of gsk has been and will remain pharmaceutical r amp d we must be relentless in our efforts to improve r amp d productivity and this is why we have started to implement a new vision of our r amp d organisation which is science led and focused on value creation
6360500 r amp d has to go where science is ripe and where new disease targets are plentiful
6360501 the result is a rebalancing of the cedds therapy areas to focus on disease areas that offer the best chance of success
6360502 externalising r amp d enables gsk to capture scientific diversity and balance expenditure and risk in drug development
6360503 in the future we believe that up to 50 of gsks drug discovery could be sourced from outside the company
6360504 we size them according to the people needed to do the science
6360505 we believe that drug discovery is best optimised through research by small focused teams
6360506 building on the success of our cedds we have now pushed our organisational design further to increase product flow and value
6360507 the approach is borrowed from the venture capital world but is different in that gsk is acting as both the funder and recipient of the output
6360508 invest in the areas most likely to deliver value to the pipeline and the most significant clinical benefit plans will demonstrate focus and make clear what the value proposition is for gsk they will be judged by their ambition and willingness to take risks
6360509 that recognises success and ambitious risk taking leading to innovation
6360510 teams will also be held accountable for failure and poor decisions
6360511 dont fidget with too many widgets but plan for blidgets
6360512 today marks the beginning of reorganizing boxing in uganda our challenge is to make sure we bring boxing back to the level at which it was in the yester years
6360513 we must make sure boxing survives thrives and remains a medal winner for uganda
6360514 we are not a pressure group and are not about to be one we are not here for money or a name but for the love of boxing
6360515 agatha im going to save your life and this means i have to cut it off to try and control the bleeding
6360516 i woke up that day and came to kampala to give my daughter money for a workshop she had wanted to attend before heading back to jinja where i stayed and worked
6360517 i had travelled smoothly with no glitches and premonitions of anything bad to happen
6360518 when i sat up after realising it was me they were all gathered to see i realised my right leg was shattered and there was blood everywhere
6360519 then i saw policemen chasing after a man in maybe his 30s who had abandoned a salon car nearby
6360520 however the man was caught but kept denying that he was not the one driving though everyone around insisted it was him
6360521 when i first looked at my leg at the junction somewhere in my sub conscious i had known there was no way it could be stitched back because it was a mess but i dont think it had registered that i would lose a leg
6360522 i think i had been numb until then because i hadnt even felt pain until i heard the tissue snap under the scissors or whatever it is they used to amputate my leg
6360523 i realised how unprepared i was for death or anything like that because i hadnt even written a will
6360524 to live each day as if it were the last
6360525 im more thankful that god decided to keep me alive than remorseful about having one leg
6360526 nous avons choisi de mieux coordonner lensemble des services qui se consacrent ladoption

6360529 theres not one guy on this team that can carry us there are a lot of guys youve seen throughout the year that are kind of overachieving understanding how to play and learning how to execute
6360530 its been coming in spurts the last few days the last field we played at fort wayne had some tricky hops to it theyll get over that soon for the most part youre going to get plays like yesterday in the first inning a diving catch from the centerfielder ollie linton so they pick us up whenever we do bad and we do the same for them
6360531 weve got a great coaching staff and we work hard on preparing them everyday
6360532 thats part of development when it comes down to august and september youve got to reach down and find something because thats how you win championships and they will i have all the faith in the world that theyll grind every once in a while youve got to point it out to them
6360533 if you want something go and get it never wait on someone to give it to you claim it yourself
6360534 that is not the situation it is something else wrong with this girl she cant even stand on her feet and keeps spiting up blood
6360535 i will pray for you krystal that is all i can do for you im to old to be worried about you and the decisions you make you are grown now i have to let you live your life
6360536 i dont know why you did that dont you know that sh causes ink poising stupid
6360537 we want to become a firm top three player by 2010 and become number one eventually we will have to accelerate our pace in emerging markets to achieve that goal
6360538 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6360539 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6360540 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6360541 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure

6360545 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6360546 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6360547 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6360548 while hillcrest labs has a great deal of respect for nintendo and the wii hillcrest labs believes that nintendo is in clear violation of its patents and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights
6360549 we want to save a species at risk without putting humanity at risk
6360550 its a critical time for the vaquita and the mexican government has stepped up to the plate
6360551 its now or never if it keeps spreading its going to become such a problem that were never going to be able to get a handle on it
6360552 if someone is spraying to control soybean rust and they have kudzu close at hand it could allow that rust to come back to their field
6360553 seventy five thousand people at an outdoor sports palace well thats something the fuehrer would have done

6360577 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6360578 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6360579 its the first round of a general election so the state of washington in a literal sense and historic sense no longer has a primary the parties really cant choose their own nominees anymore
6360580 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters
6360581 theres a certain logic that says they ought to be the ones squaring off in november theyll have to campaign through november and be accountable to voters thats healthy for our process
6360582 im not sure where its going to go we dont have any immediate plans to claim harm from what happened yesterday in a legal sense well see how this all pans out
6360583 im still optimistic well win that lawsuit and the top two will be found to be unconstitutional
6360584 were trying every tool i cant tell you how many conversations ive had with diplomats and others i keep stressing to the russians that there are american children who are trapped
6360585 yesterday it was like 20 to 25 miles from us now its 10 miles 10 to 15 miles
6360586 maar het lijkt erop dat het vliegtuig op een van de meest kritische momenten van het opstijgen plots ernstige technische problemen kreeg
6360587 maar dit is zeker niet de enige oorzaak elke vliegtuigcrash is een samenloop van verschillende omstandigheden misschien is er ook een stuk van de motor in de staart gevlogen al is dit pure speculatie
6360588 waarschijnlijk deden de technische problemen zich voor op het moment dat de neus van het vliegtuig al in de lucht was
6360589 dit is een van de meest kritische momenten bij het opstijgen als er op dat ogenblik iets misloopt krijgt zelfs de meest geoefende astronaut het vliegtuig niet meer veilig aan de grond
6360590 maar het betekent ni t automatisch dat er iets ernstigs aan de hand was waarschijnlijk hebben de piloten in samenspraak met de technici besloten dat ze toch konden vertrekken maar dat het toestel even later neerstortte is wel iets te veel toeval

6360606 to avoid detection provide self protection and enable effective communications
6360607 no 2 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
6360608 if you want it for art and decoration thats fine but for achieving any kind of power thats useful its not a very good idea and i dont know of anywhere thats done it very successfully
6360609 they can help just like biofuels can help just like tides can help in the end it is conservation that is the main thing you and i can do and that we can do in this city
6360610 unficyp estimates as of end 2000 idp population in northern cyprus 45 000 persons idp population in southern cyprus 165 000 persons total idp population 210 000 persons
6360611 we sincerely hope our readers will appreciate the improvements in the quality of the print results
6360612 the process is somewhat like rerouting traffic on a highway under repair
6360613 while traffic must keep moving on a highway under repair so must the presses continue to roll while being worked on
6360614 presses like highways develop wear over the months and years of use the almost continuous running of the giant steel rollers and all associated parts of the press demand attention over time
6360615 our readers and advertisers have always expected the highest quality we can deliver and we insist on continuing to deliver that level of expectation
6360616 the irs still allows you to deduct the full blue book value of your car when you donate it to a charity that re gifts it to a person in need
6360617 we have lined up some volunteers who are willing to work on the donated cars to get them ready for the people who enter the second chance enterprise program
6360618 one of the volunteers has a farm where he can store the cars until we have people in the program but i dont think anyone wants to work on a car when its cold out
6360619 its gone through the first two steps and we want to hit the ground with our wheels rolling
6360620 single parents former inmates and others can participate in the program
6360621 we could provide them with jobs in the catering or lawn service business but also provide mandatory financial training to show them how to manage their money so they wont be broke before payday
6360622 one thing that we say a lot here at the wade center is that were not just addressing the symptoms of poverty were attacking the root causes that have people trapped in the cycle of poverty
6360623 once someone graduates from our second chance program i can go to an employer and say this person is well trained reliable and ready to be a good employee
6360624 from what we have been able to determine having a dependable car makes all the difference in someone being able to make it to work
6360625 shift from full time cfia meat inspection presence to an oversight role allowing industry to implement food safety control programs and to manage key risks
6360626 i have only a finite number of words in me
6360627 i cant remember the last time i used a notebook
6360628 this feels more like a blog post rosie a good blog but a lame article
6360629 theres got to be nine million government bodies that would have to approve this the way politics work in this state and city the odds of this happening are close to zero
6360630 more than 100 years ago a new statue standing tall in new york harbor gave our nation its greatest symbol of freedom
6360631 in this century that freedom is being undermined by dependence on foreign oil so i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm
6360632 the current wind turbine technology is not designed for installation at those heights
6360633 the clock acts as an incentive the impact is real on staff
6360634 if some of this stuff comes to fruition it might give him an even bigger legacy
6360635 obviously we were not happy they didnt move faster to clean up the adjacent properties
6360636 theyre coming out saying come for lunch come for lunch
6360637 i think what needs to be reviewed is whether you should have an agency overseeing these really important functions

6360640 i am very concerned that mr mcguinty just says dont worry the investigation will be over soon enough well do something in due course and people are expected to twist in the wind in the meantime
6360641 i think everybody understands that as a father you have to be with your daughter when shes turning 13
6360642 we are going to start the school year somewhere between 750 and 760 students
6360643 we finished last year right around 600 students my understanding is the majority of the pocahontas students chose to come to tazewell you are talking 70 some additional students here we are glad of that we welcome them with open arms they have adjusted well over the summer they are ready to become bulldogs
6360644 we do have pocahontas students and many of them came today for orientation
6360645 just like everyone else they just jumped in and are off and running i think right now we are pretty much just holding steady with enrollment we are not up or down we normally hover around 500 students
6360646 so it is a little different atmosphere for the first two days of school without that
6360647 it graham beaver always has that excitement level really high for the first two days of school however we still play this friday at christiansburg so we will get ready for that all of our fall teams have been playing and practicing
6360648 monday that fire will be lit and it will build throughout the week

6360650 oh yes we are ready for our students and we are excited to have them back
6360651 we are looking forward to a good school year everyone is ready
6360652 it can be done and it will be done because it has to be done
6360653 theres a myriad of geopolitical factors rumbling in the background russia iran
6360654 gregory amp appel uses a team approach to develop a multi layer relationship
6360655 we have a large number of specialty programs that have helped us during the soft market
6360656 they also give us some market clout with our insurers
6360657 drank is niet ons maar wij zijn de drank de baas omdat jezus christus onze heer is
6360658 de telefoon fungeert dan als elektronische portemonnee waardoor de klant niet meer in de rij bij de kassa hoeft te staan
6360659 wat we nu zien is een duidelijke hergroepering en ook opnieuw een soort misleidingscampagne om de indruk van vertrek te wekken
6360660 we zien de eerste tekenen van terugtrekking het is echter nog niet veelbetekenend
6360661 wellicht een eerste signaal kunnen zijn dat het gedaalde consumentenvertrouwen de consumentenbestedingen be nvloedt
6360662 de cijfers vallen tegen de vertraging in de economie zien we nu terug in de horeca

6360664 internationale communicatie met behulp van een internationale taal is niet alleen noodzakelijk maar een vanzelfsprekende zaak esperanto is de beste oplossing van de idee van een internationale taal
6360665 dat bij geen wezenlijke voortgang of vooruitgang ontbinding van de vereniging ter discussie gesteld dient te worden
6360666 we moeten wel realistisch blijven het esperanto heeft voorlopig weinig perspectief toch is er tot op heden van opheffing geen sprake dan vergeten we de positieve dingen de leden zijn namelijk gemotiveerd en er komen nog regelmatig jonge nieuwe leden bij
6360667 van groot belang dat het esperanto als gemeenschappelijke taal wordt ingevoerd en dat de volkeren tot elkaar naderen als n familie
6360668 onder het heilige teken van de hoop verzamelen zich strijders voor de vrede
6360669 in het congresboekje heb ik mijn respect en waardering uitgesproken voor uw doel met het esperanto
6360670 in tijden van idealisme pacifisme en behoefte aan verbroedering leeft de taal meer dan in tijden van individualisme
6360671 kunstmatige talen zijn er veel geweest maar 99 procent is in de kinderschoenen blijven staan het esperanto is een taal met een geschiedenis met zogenoemde moedertaalsprekers met een eigen literatuur en radioprogrammas
6360672 esperanto heeft praktische voordelen boven het engels als het gaat om zending
6360673 ik zou niet weten waarom tegenwoordig spreken we ook allemaal engels ik zie geen principieel verschil tussen gebruik van het engels en van het esperanto
6360674 nee dat was in een speciale tijd de mensen gehoorzaamden niet aan gods gebod om de aarde te vervullen vooral om die overtreding zijn de mensen bij de bouw van de toren van babel gestraft
6360675 dat is erg na ef mondiale vrede is met menselijk streven niet te bereiken iedereen weet wat er in de mens is er is alleen vrede in het hart mogelijk door het geloof in jezus christus
6360676 david shakespeare said the job was mine but went back on his word after lobbying by a group of homophobic bigoted old farts
6360677 i have no doubt that the objection to my appointment is not unrelated to the strong stance on equality issues and modernisation which i have taken
6360678 brian was very upset because he thought he was going to get the job and he does have a habit of firing from all cylinders but if there is any homophobia in the party i am unaware of it
6360679 palestine calls to you support me liberate me i am your mother and you are my sons
6360680 after seeing sharp falls in the last few weeks gold and platinum are supported as we are starting to see some bargain hunting from end users
6360681 falls from here would be limited but we have to see how the euro behaves against the dollar from here another decline in the euro would drag precious metals and other commodities along
6360682 volume remains very thin because most people are on vacation i suspect we might have already seen a short term low of 773
6360683 so it just plays with the range for the time being
6360684 i think its a bit oversold earlier on but i dont think it could bounce back to the 1 500 1 600 areas its quite difficult so its still consolidating for the time being
6360685 our epc entry strategy is a combination of both we are bidding globally and we are also bidding in india as this a tender based process
6360686 we have seen a lot of consumption in the last 15 days mainly from people who had postponed buying in the last few months
6360687 what weve heard in the market is that sinopec looked at it but they didnt really go through with it in any serious form the talk in the market about sinopec is overblown
6360688 it would be awfully disappointing for them to miss it again
6360689 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6360690 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6360691 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6360692 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6360693 in many ways its different to the last difficult period we had because of the lack of availability of mortgages

6360695 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible this effort is one of what we believe will be many exciting new ways to bring the internet to the tv and it really shows the potential of what consumers can look forward to

6360697 for the last hundred years media has been pushed out to people but now marketers are going to be a part of the conversation and theyre going to do this by using the social graph in the same way our users do
6360698 methods for reaching consumers especially in a day and age where these things often come at the expense of individual privacy
6360699 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6360700 how many women feel like theyre the hottest thing on the planet right now i feel like im motherfucking magnificent
6360701 no israel is a jewish state its a jewish state
6360702 i believe that our value proposition will continue to attract more members as well as to deliver increased frequency
6360703 because the majority of bjs sales are derived from non discretionary items we have been able to generate strong top line growth in a challenging macro environment
6360704 the online auction giant hoping to boost inventory and revive growth will imitate amazon and court users who sell at fixed prices

6360707 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6360708 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6360709 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6360710 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away
6360711 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6360712 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6360713 from a consumer standpoint more and more of these feed costs are going to be passed on and that means higher prices at the supermarket
6360714 we wont have to pass on 8 a bushel corn but we will have to pass on 6 corn
6360715 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6360716 unless some kind of miracle happens i dont see it
6360717 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6360718 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6360719 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6360720 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6360721 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6360722 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6360723 we had two of the most bearish factors thrown at oil today and were closing moderately higher
6360724 were seeing supply concerns go back into the price of a barrel of oil
6360725 we reiterate that fundamentals in the oil market suggest a return to a rising oil price environment
6360726 consumers can take some solace in the sell off but there are more supportive factors down the road here
6360727 to have just one event meant the pressure i was under was unbelievable
6360728 i knew it was always the case but it is unfair i guess
6360729 how high do you think du toit would have come if she had two legs instead of one
6360730 ive got a job to do and too many challenges within british cycling to think about moving anywhere else there isnt another job that i want
6360731 i knew the track was fast but i never thought this was possible
6360732 i got away well and ran the corner as hard as i could as i entered the straight i just told myself keep it up dont die on me now i left everything on the track
6360733 this record means so much ive been aspiring to it for so long michael johnson was a great athlete but i cant compare myself to anyone im just trying to be me
6360734 to experience the thrill of an olympic final again means so much its the culmination of a lot of hard work
6360735 i never gave up hope that it would happen again ive always believed in myself it was just a case of whether my body would hold up
6360736 thats the morale of the story dont ever give up thats why i want the next generation to understand everything does not go your way the whole time
6360737 sometimes you get injured sometimes you get hurt we have got some great talent in this country who are not here tonight guys like mark lewis francis thats what they need to know
6360738 it does matter what is going on right now because there is always tomorrow
6360739 i am elated to get this medal it has easily been one of the worst seasons of my life and one of the best at the same time
6360740 you want to play your best cards at the olympics but it just didnt happen for me
6360741 i dont know what went wrong everything seemed to be going okay i took the lead and tried to drag the pace along but on the last lap i was passed and i couldnt respond
6360742 blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted
6360743 the people who have walked in darkness have seen a great light
6360744 the most unsavoury aspect of the jensenites distortion of the simple message of jesus is its concentration on sin and guilt without a compensating sense of human worth
6360745 what god wants is belief in certain propositions about jesus and salvation and without that belief good actions are not pleasing to god
6360746 the kingdom of god is near repent and believe the good news
6360747 a legal malpractice case is the somewhat surprising setting for an interesting daubert toxic tort opinion but we found one young et al v burton et al 2008 wl 2810237 d d c 7 22 08
6360748 my daughter is still living at home because shes going to a local community college
6360749 i was spying on my guys neighbors who were skinny dipping in their pool when he came into the room and caught me
6360750 i feel i have earned my right to be in beijing
6360751 i have worked really hard to get here but i have not just come for the experience i want to take part
6360752 id honestly be really disappointed if i was not involved
6360753 there are going to be five people used with one person involved in the heats
6360754 i desperately want to be part of the olympics but it is not in my hands at the moment so i am just crossing my fingers
6360755 thats just a shower the real rain starts in about an hour or so
6360756 the records not finished its supposed to be me and rihannas duet
6360757 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have
6360758 so with rihanna that was an idea i had i just wanted to go totally left and kind of weird and thats what i threw at her
6360759 having the support of my fans on the second round was just incredible and its even getting bigger now
6360760 maybe stenciled mink in the body and a fox collar

6360766 we shoot for probably a little higher than the shoulder maybe the top of the head or at least the eyes
6360767 this is the new team that just tried out and formed so everyone gets to know each other now plus we get time with the band and i really love the band
6360768 i think everybodys had pulled muscles and hurt legs and soreness
6360769 i wanted to be on that stage on the football field dancing i thought it looked so fun being with all your friends and the band
6360770 when i was an oakette we did strictly military drills and not nearly as much of the dancing as the girls do now
6360771 we shoot for probably a little higher than the shoulder maybe the top of the head or at least the eyes
6360772 this is the new team that just tried out and formed so everyone gets to know each other now plus we get time with the band and i really love the band
6360773 i think everybodys had pulled muscles and hurt legs and soreness
6360774 i wanted to be on that stage on the football field dancing i thought it looked so fun being with all your friends and the band
6360775 when i was an oakette we did strictly military drills and not nearly as much of the dancing as the girls do now
6360776 no 2 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
6360777 if you want it for art and decoration thats fine but for achieving any kind of power thats useful its not a very good idea and i dont know of anywhere thats done it very successfully
6360778 they can help just like biofuels can help just like tides can help in the end it is conservation that is the main thing you and i can do and that we can do in this city
6360779 we are delighted to congratulate the reach scholars who earned high marks on rigorous college level exams
6360780 i would have thought for kids who were on the borderline that they would have seen an improvement
6360781 ik ben als ondernemer altijd op zoek naar een manier om mijn portfolio aan te vullen met goede idee n en invloedrijke personen of bier bij mij past jazeker ik ga regelmatig naar de sportschool en ik zorg goed voor mezelf maar dat wil niet zeggen dat ik niet van een koud biertje houd

6360783 every engine was stopped the plug was driven out of every boiler every fire was extinguished every man was turned out the decree went forth that labour was to cease until the charter was the law of the land the mine and the mill the foundry and the loom shop were until that consummation to be idle
6360784 oh we didnt bother about ministers we were satisfied with each other i believe they called him allbutt but im not sure
6360785 with the proverbial sixpence i sent my eldest lad who was then between six and seven years of age to buy sixpennyworth of oranges and these he afterwards disposed of at a profit and by the end of the day returned home with a basket of oranges and some coppers to spare
6360786 my husband said it was a wilderness where no one could live i wanted to know whether my lads could live there so i went to see and found it a grand place
6360787 we have sent word to them to engage a flying machine for the day
6360788 we wisten dat we weinig tijd hadden om in een studio op te nemen omdat we opnames hadden van camp rock disney film en meteen daarna moesten we touren met
6360789 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them just made them go with the action urgently
6360790 its the first round of a general election so the state of washington in a literal sense and historic sense no longer has a primary the parties really cant choose their own nominees anymore
6360791 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters
6360792 theres a certain logic that says they ought to be the ones squaring off in november theyll have to campaign through november and be accountable to voters thats healthy for our process
6360793 im not sure where its going to go we dont have any immediate plans to claim harm from what happened yesterday in a legal sense well see how this all pans out
6360794 im still optimistic well win that lawsuit and the top two will be found to be unconstitutional
6360795 you know that you are on the front line in the fight against the taliban
6360796 you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6360797 its going to take a while for it to sink in
6360798 i gave it everything and now i have something to show for it its a once in a lifetime experience
6360799 i knew maarten finished well so i was trying to stay with him
6360800 i had to battle with the group with 700 metres to go and i lost a lot of strength in the fight to stay in the race
6360801 that cost me silver but i am happy with bronze
6360802 its the first time that i have got two cards in my career
6360803 i felt like it was an out of body experience
6360804 is this really happening to me right now am i really doing this we just made the united states very proud
6360805 wed like to see them scale up to a full system beyond just tests sooner rather than later
6360806 the difference is we have molasses that degrades very quickly or oil that dissolves very slowly but provides enough dissolved material to feed the bacteria to do the same job
6360807 il legislatore stato scavalcato dalla confraternita dei fratelli musulmani che controlla il sindacato dei medici e che ha imposto una norma fortemente discriminatoria violando i diritti umani e la costituzione e minando lunit nazionale
6360808 questo divieto non far altro che peggiorare il fragile equilibrio tra le due comunit
6360809 la norma non ha senso perch il traffico dorgani pu interessare anche fedeli della stessa religione di questo passo avremo ospedali distinti per cristiani e musulmani o il divieto di donare sangue tra persone che professano un diverso credo religioso per non parlare dellimpossibilit per un medico di visitare un paziente di religione diversa dalla propria
6360810 zwei fl ge dieses flugzeuges mussten in den vergangenen tagen bereits wegen technischer probleme gestrichen werden
6360811 auch wenn diese vorg nge zeitlich nur einen geringen anteil ausmachen am gesamten flug
6360812 grunds tzlich sind beim start zwei geschwindigkeiten zu unterscheiden v1 die sogenannte entscheidungsgeschwindigkeit und v2 die abhebegeschwindigkeit
6360813 ist das flugzeug aber schneller muss der start trotz allem weitergef hrt werden weil f r eine bremsung nicht gen gend platz mehr da ist auf der piste
6360814 ich verstehe seine freude er selbst interpretiert das vielleicht anders aber man empfindet das als eine art fangspiel das macht man nicht
6360815 ich bin die nummer eins ich bin die nummer eins

6360821 for aram a minha cabe a contra o ch o e tamparam minha boca
6360822 eram dois homens muito fortes e eu n o pude fazer nada contra eles

6360832 the two girls make out hardcore rolling around in a bed it was a really hot scene
6360833 i eat and seduce everyone theres a lot of kissing everyone boys and girls all kinds of craziness
6360834 everybody wants to know what it was like penelope had less facial hair than a guy so it was certainly more pleasant it was better than kissing jonathan rhys meyers in
6360835 the two girls make out hardcore rolling around in a bed it was a really hot scene
6360836 so long and thanks for all the bananas on the way out
6360837 i saw a lot of incorrect comments above regarding how much tax
6360838 there are many f1 drivers who are waiting for a win and there are f1 drivers like lewis that they came with very good package doing very good job and they manage to win straightaway so im pretty happy with what i have achieved but of course you always want more
6360839 to be honest i will be not disappointed if i do not become world champion because i think all drivers would like to be world champion but only one is winning and it is not only depending on myself
6360840 for me the most important thing is to be happy of what im doing because i can be quite negative to myself of what im doing how im driving
6360841 there are lots of drivers who arrive in f1 and you know that theyre good but they dont have theyre sort of missing an ingredient with some drivers but i think hes got that extra ingredient
6360842 id be very surprised if he wasnt on the shopping list of the top teams
6360843 that time was the best time of my life i enjoyed what i was doing i was really on it i was having a lot of fun
6360844 i was not really at that time i was not realizing what i had achieved
6360845 thats why privately im not going to poland unfortunately i say unfortunately because in the end its my home and i miss to be honest this kind of freedom that i had five years ago
6360846 last time i went jogging in poland i couldnt run for five minutes without somebody who was asking me something or stopping me
6360847 its nice but in the end when im at home i have some job to do which i need quiet atmosphere to do
6360848 i think its good its also what you do on the weekend to relax at the track and stop thinking
6360849 my job is to generate quality sales leads via the web so our sales team has to do less cold calling ive had to do cold calling in my career and i wouldnt wish that on anyone
6360850 ah one of lawrence sanders archy mcnally books i havent read
6360851 morgans 25th century earth is convincing while the questions he poses about how much self is tied to body chemistry and how the rich believe themselves above the law are especially timely

6360853 sesungguhnya orang orang yang takut kepada tuhanna yang tidak nampak oleh mereka mereka akan memperoleh ampunan dan pahala yang besar
6360854 telah datang kepada kamu ramadhan bulan yang berkah allah telah mewajibkan ke atas kamu puasanya di buka padanya pintu pintu langit dan ditutup pada pintu pintu neraka dan dibelenggu padanya syaitan demi allah padanya terdapat satu malam yang lebih baik daripada seribu bulan sesiapa yang diharamkan kebaikannnya maka diharamkan
6360855 ya allah bantulah aku untuk mengingatimu mensyukurimu serta memperbaiki amalan ku kepadamu
6360856 pernahkah amirul mukminin berjalan di jalan yang banyak onakdan duri
6360857 aku berjalan dengan waspada dan bersungguh sungguh supaya tidak memijak ataupun terpijak onak dan duri
6360858 orang yang bertaqwa itu adalah mereka yang takut dalam keadaan berwaspada daripada balasan allah dengan meninggalkan apayang didorong oleh hawa nafsu kepadanya dan mengharapkan rahmat allah dengan percaya kepada apa apa yang datang daripadanya
6360859 sesungguhnya solatku ibadahku hidupku matiku adalah untuk allah rabb sekalain alam
6360860 im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula 1 can be
6360861 clearly though i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim
6360862 im looking forward to getting into the cockpit on friday morning it looks like being an amazing track
6360863 you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite
6360864 there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff
6360865 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
6360866 it will be an authentic street circuit in the sense that it runs through the town center
6360867 its always a special feeling to race in front of my countrymen and im really looking forward to it
6360868 in barcelona we were having a strong race when i had to retire but i hope this time i can get a good result as the circuit will be new for all the drivers
6360869 wir glauben dass das nicht alles ist dass dies erst der anfang ist
6360870 ich will nicht anma end klingen aber es gab einen gro en territorialen konflikt bei der gr ndung der nato der hie ost deutschland
6360871 und wir haben westdeutschland deswegen nicht daran gehindert der nato beizutreten
6360872 schlie lich hat deutschland in der nato nicht nur seine teilung berwunden sondern auch durch demokratischen frieden seine sehr schwierige geschichte mit den nachbarn
6360873 wir m ssen uns an diese geschichte erinnern wenn wir ber die territorialen probleme georgiens reden
6360874 georgien wird wenn es das will mitglied der nato werden
6360875 l nder die selbst in regionale oder innere konflikte verstrickt sind k nnen aus meiner sicht nicht mitglieder der nato sein wir sind ein b ndnis zur verteidigung der sicherheit und keines in dem einzelne mitglieder noch mit ihrer eigenen sicherheit zu tun haben
6360876 ich habe niemals geglaubt dass das argument georgien sei auch f r den map ungeeignet weil es ein territoriales problem gibt viel sinn macht

6360898 my personal dream came true late last year when a group led by roger kornberg at stanford university made a breakthrough experiment determining the atomic structure of gold nanoparticles of a certain size the structure resembled the prediction our research group had already earlier published in the recent study we were able to comprehend why nature generates exactly these kinds of particles the size of one particle is 1 3 nanometers and since they behave in many respects like giant atoms we call them superatoms in our study
6360899 our study would not have been possible without the extensive high performance computing resources of the national it centres of finland germany and sweden the study took up quite a lot of computation time but it was well worth the effort i believe that our theoretical model on the stability of the gold nanoparticles will prove itself very useful in many interdisciplinary fields of research

6360910 a la feria se viene a comer la comida tradicional de m laga
6360911 en mi casa siempre se ha vivido el mundo del toreo mi padre y mi abuelo fueron banderilleros y los abuelos de mi padre tambi n vamos yo soy el quinto fandila que se dedica al toreo as que desde peque ito siempre he estado jugando al toro ahora el toreo es mi forma de vida y a lo que le debo todo lo que tengo
6360912 desde luego el torero es una persona que nace y se hace porque tienes que nacer con algo dentro la ilusi n las ganas pero luego te vas depurando mucho adem s los toreros sin tener que ser personas muy distintas a las dem s s es cierto que por ejemplo aunque seamos j venes maduramos muy r pido
6360913 el miedo es algo que siempre se tiene en muchos mbitos de la vida pero en el mundo del toro se palpa a n m s no s c mo explicarlo m s que el miedo al animal se tiene miedo a defraudar a no ser capaz de afrontar las adversidades pero es un miedo que eres capaz de superar y de darle la vuelta el valor es algo muy de cabeza por l gica no se har an cosas que se hacen en el toreo pero la mentalizaci n es muy grande y el valor sale de ah de la preparaci n despu s est la capacidad de cada uno de superar las dificultades y los miedos y hay quien tiene m s o menos valor
6360914 el triunfo es algo muy bonito es con lo que siempre se sue a con triunfar con disfrutar y con hacerte un sitio en una profesi n tan complicada y tan bonita como esta yo creo que la base del xito es conseguir metas sentirse feliz con lo que uno hace y conseguir que la gente que te rodea y que va a la plaza disfrute con algo que t sientes
6360915 el fracaso es muy complicado aunque yo lo llamar a mejor desilusi n fracaso no s por muy grande que sea el petardo una tarde lo cierto es que no se acaba el mundo la desilusi n s es algo m s doloroso porque tantas ilusiones puestas tantas horas entrenando tantas ganas de que las cosas salgan bien y cuando no embiste la corrida cuando todo sale al rev s m s que fracaso lo que se te crea es una enorme desilusi n y un gran vac o interior
6360916 lo mejor del toreo es disfrutar cuando uno cuaja un toro y se siente a gusto en la plaza cuando sientes que miles de personas disfrutan con lo que t haces llega un momento en que la satisfacci n personal que est s viviendo no se cambia ni se compara con nada
6360917 existe mucha rivalidad hoy en d a en el toreo y aunque te lleves bien y haya compa eros con los que tienes una relaci n fenomenal y con los que comentas y hablas cuando sale el toro lo que tratas es de solucionar tu tarde y de forjarte un futuro y es una situaci n que tienes que defender t cuando sale el toro de cada uno aqu nos olvidamos de los amigos y eso es bueno y bonito es positivo que un torero se crezca viendo a otro y que cada uno en su forma sin imitar a nadie haga su toreo y la gente pueda ver dentro de diferentes conceptos toreros con ilusi n y con ganas de abrirse paso
6360918 cada persona es un mundo pero para m el d a que toreo los peores momentos los vivo cuando ya te han terminado de vestir llegas a la plaza y est s esperando antes de hacer el pase llo ah te rodea mucha gente y todo el mundo quiere hablarte y estar a tu lado pero para m es de los momentos m s delicados despu s cuando haces el pase llo parece que rompe un poco la tarde y se rompen muchas tensiones
6360919 los toreros somos personas que estamos siempre rodeados de mucha gente de mucho bullicio en los hoteles todo el mundo corriendo con prisas la plaza sin duda hay momentos en los que necesitamos desaparecer del mundo irnos al campo y tener un poco de paz no s si de soledad pero s de tranquilidad en los momentos de soledad que vives por ejemplo en el hotel es distinto en esos momentos intentas poner la mente en otra cosa para que las horas te pasen m s amenas tambi n hay veces que toreas en sitios importantes y entonces piensas en lo que te gustar a que pasase en la plaza
6360920 cuando toreas no piensas en sufrir por nadie bastante mal se pasa delante del toro para empezar a sufrir antes de tiempo aunque s es cierto que lo pasas un poco mal por tu gente por los que te aprecian y quieren esta es una profesi n en la que te vas del hotel y no sabes c mo vas a volver no hay un gui n determinado todos los d as tiras una moneda al aire y t a lo mejor no lo piensas pero los que te quieren como mi madre por ejemplo s de hecho para ellos es la primera llamada cuando llego al hotel para mi novia y mi madre

6361278 in the ever growing desire to produce smaller less costly yet more powerful and faster computers and storage devices researchers today said they are looking at a way to use self growing fabrics that will let manufacturers build nano sized high resolution semiconductors and arrays to answer that craving researchers at the nanoscale science and engineering center nsec at the university of wisconsin madison have come up with a method that uses existing technology to combine the lithography techniques traditionally used to pattern microelectronics with novel self assembling materials known as block copolymers researchers said when combined with a lithographically patterned surface the block copolymers long molecular chains spontaneously assemble into the designated arrangements
6361279 we can really prove that theres no algorithm no way that the particle can give an answer that is unique and can be specified ahead of time im still amazed that we can actually manage to prove that

6361281 noids the new artificial intelligence 02 11 97 in email discussions i mentioned the skyheart device claimed to be a unique form of ai that mimics its owner once programmed it is supposed to develop a heartbeat in the form of a pulsing blue led and has all kinds of bizarre anecdotes associated with the operation of the units despite the 3000 price of the skyheart the idea of an electrostatic matrix used to dynamically map a persons biopatterns intrigues me i will eventually transcribe the skyheart audio to text these new interactive ai devices are called noids on checking out the neutronics site i am uncomfortable with them not posting the price of their hardware and imposing confidentiality agreements with purchases

6361295 to make the suggestion that any prime minister who wants to engage china when the rest of the world is engaging with china is doing it for personal reasons is something that is just the type of attack that one would expect from jason kenney

6361327 i think its dangerous to view the science through the lens of whether it will help advance a policy proposal in the public arena yes they are probably correct to observe that medium term cooling of apparently non anthropogenic origin will make it harder to persuade the public to take immediate action they are also correct to observe that the long term warming trend is still real despite its coexistence with other cyclical factors at the end of the day if you keep adding a heat absorbing substance to a system receiving thermal radiation eventually youll get a system that is overall warmer at least when averaged over the time scale of cyclical effects

6361335 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6361336 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer

6361355 palestine calls to you support me liberate me i am your mother and you are my sons
6361356 you may feel like ok i can go out here and sprint through my routes but thats definitely not the case youve still got some healing going on down there dont come back until youre definitely 100 percent because when you have surgery down there there are a lot of things that can go wrong
6361357 you never want to see one of your starters go out hopefully he wont be out for the whole season he can get back really quick we can hold down the fort until he gets back
6361358 i just go out there and work hard and compete and be at the highest level possible first game starting in the nfl im just hoping to go out there and make a great impression i know what im capable of doing and all the hard work ive put in the time has come and i just cant wait until friday
6361359 lets not let preseason deceive us any first he has a lot of hard work ahead of him he does show up though
6361360 i think hes going to be a pretty good player
6361361 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that hes going to be the next panthers star steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
6361362 you have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted in this league
6361363 hes made catches with the 1s and the 2s obviously hes getting open
6361364 there were plays where the ball was not thrown right and he was still open hes definitely learning the offense the guys hot you go with him thats just another weapon
6361365 im confident in jackson and his athletic ability and what he can do for this offense i cant say if its overwhelming or unrealistic or what not because im not desean i dont know how he feels about it im confident in him going out there and doing what he did in college just coming out and continuing what hes done in the preseason making plays and getting better each and every week
6361366 youve got to take care of the ball a little more
6361367 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labor can she serve
6361368 but they can also be taken away at any time
6361369 i lost i dont know what to say my dreams are crushed
6361370 the thing is when youre normal for 17 years and suddenly you lose a limb youre not disabled mentally
6361371 youre still the same person so you want to do the same things youve done before
6361372 its to come from an accident and say i can still do it if i work hard i think thats the most important thing to believe in yourself to set goals and to never give up
6361373 i had a couple of people who have said to me that it would never be possible
6361374 it was actually right after i had been in the hospital and had my amputation but a dream is about what you set for yourself and not what other people set for you
6361375 it is exceedingly hard to understand just looking at her inspires you
6361376 i would go so far as to say she should be awarded a separate medal
6361377 shes an inspiration to everyone it just shows you can do what you want if you put your mind to it
6361378 we just didnt stick to it and once you give them a sniff its over
6361379 they can go small they can go big and theyre all good
6361380 you try to play them one way and as soon as you think youve got some stops got some momentum they just totally change the way of the game and then all of a sudden the momentum is all them
6361381 the thing we tried to do is not play like every other team and play off the dribble we tried to play with passing and cutting but they adjusted and played very hard in the second half
6361382 weve been in games in this tournament where teams have led or are tied with us at one point
6361383 you look over at the scorers bench and theyre bringing in kobe lebron and carmelo
6361384 its been a tough 4 or 5 years for us
6361385 its funny i told him only my wife and mom call me lee tohhh its kind of hard to say my name the right way when youre saying it fast
6361386 i dont want fans to get on him for my situation
6361387 this is just one small token thats one less thing they have to worry about as far as school supplies it might not sound like a big thing but a lot of the kids cant go buy book bags and pads and pencils and stuff i want to try to eliminate at least that small part
6361388 shawn is going to give it a go and well just see how he feels
6361389 resilience of both social and natural diversity with a strong case about the limits in principle of what we are likely to know about complex functioning order
6361390 much of this book can be read as a case against the imperialism of high modernist planned social order i stress the word imperialism here because i am emphatically not making a blanket case against either bureaucratic planning or high modernist ideology i am however making a case against imperial or hegemonic planning mentality that excludes the necessary role of local knowledge and know how
6361391 as we shall see the conclusions that can be drawn from the failures of the modern projects of social engineering are as applicable to market driven standardization as they are to bureaucratic homogeneity
6361392 envisioning a sweeping rational engineering of all aspect of social like in order to improve the human condition 88
6361393 of how the benefits of technical and scientific progress might be applied usually through the state in every field of human activity 90
6361394 like all utopian schemes fallen well short of attaining its goal the critical fact is that is did partly succeed 19
6361395 to make a society legible to arrange the population in ways that simplified the classic state functions of taxation conscription and the prevention of rebellion
6361396 all the state simplifications that we have examined have the character of maps that is they are designed to summarize precisely those aspects of a complex world that are of immediate interest to the mapmaker and to ignore the rest
6361397 in addition like scott argued it is hard to predict the outcome of the actions of government intervention thus it is hard to always do good
6361398 the argument is ultimately one between full government intervention and no government intervention
6361399 such plans which have the scale of toys are judged for their sculptural properties and visual order often from a perspective that no or very few human observers will ever replicate
6361400 cities have the capability of providing something for everybody only when they are created by everybody
6361401 set its sights on creating dozens of new editors and administrators over a long period of time
6361402 the washington post arab israeli commentary by outside writers is overwhelmingly pro palestinian anti israeli or both
6361403 the washington post rarely publishes outside commentary by israelis in the news or their supporters whose views contradict those of palestinians like the terrorists hamas advisor ahmad yousef hamas prime minister ismail haniyeh or hamas leader mousa abu marzook or those of palestinian apologists like journalist daoud kuttab former us diplomat aaron david miller and former clinton advisor robert malley or anti israel polemicists like former us president carter
6361404 the art of the possible peace rices first task a viable israeli palestinian cease fire
6361405 the specter of hamastan more must be done to counter islamist gains in gaza
6361406 necessary steps for israel confronting state sponsors of terror is the only option
6361407 rather than representing the nations most important forum on the most contentious issues of the day the new york times has become a vehicle for one sided pro arab advocacy in a contentious debate
6361408 discusses israeli hizballah conflict as part of a larger conflict financed and directed by iran and syria
6361409 thats the only remains of kathryn mckay thats her right foot and ankle
6361410 i put it to you that it is clear that you intended to kill these people
6361411 you intended to kill them and you intended to eliminate any evidence of that crime that would in any way connect you to it
6361412 i wasnt asking questions i just did what i was told
6361413 terror in the name of god why religious militants kill
6361414 a network of networks of various types it will include leaderless resisters lone wolf avengers commanders cadres freelancers and franchises
6361415 the conceptual world of the taliban al qaeda and their ilk
6361416 promoting a mixture of religious and material objectives for example acquiring political power to impose a particular interpretation of religious laws or appealing to religious texts to justify acquisition of contested territory
6361417 how can it be that the same faith in god that inspired michelangelo mozart simone weil and sister miriam therese also inspires such vicious crimes why when they read religious texts do these terrorists find justification for killing innocents where others find inspiration for charity
6361418 all religions allow people the right to kill in self defense or to defend their lad land has been taken from us with violence and we have the right to take it back
6361419 when a thief is stealing from you you dont have to bring him to court if you can catch up with him you take your property back by force rabin was stealing jewish property
6361420 just as al qaeda and the international islamic front have emphasized penetrating us we need to penetrate them
6361421 terror in the name of god why religious militants kill
6361422 a dialogue on these issues never happened and policies failed miserably
6361423 development encompasses not just resources and capital but a transformation of society
6361424 an investment strategy that promotes investing in the home economy
6361425 the worlds political economic and social decisions cannot be determined by the minds of a couple trade ministers
6361426 the most important thing in stiglitzs view is to change the structure of the existing global governance through improving dialogue
6361427 it seems obvious that if the developed countries truly wanted to promote development in the doha round they should reduce their tariffs and subsidies on the goods of interest to the developing countries pg 13
6361428 nafta was not really a free trade agreement america retained its agricultural subsidies nafta pitted the heavily subsidized us agribusiness sector against peasant producers and family farms in mexico pg 24
6361429 none of todays rich countries developed by simply opening themselves to foreign trade pg 38
6361430 did not feel at the time that he could openly criticize the us governments position because he was in the government
6361431 the problem today with globalization is that economic globalization had outpaced political globalization
6361432 liberalization of countries economies before the establishment of institutional infrastructure leads to financial disaster
6361433 a lot of people have talked about this in theory for some time but it was fascinating to actually identify the chemicals
6361434 our hope is that by changing the sequence we can get sensors that respond differently to chemicals they are exposed to
6361435 out of dozens and dozens of other signals that are floating around
6361436 doesnt know in advance what it is going to encounter
6361437 society has changed fundamentally and the measure of it is that the official fatwa religious edict of old no longer has the hold it had
6361438 a girl or young man who hears a fatwa doesnt just obey he goes to google and hears other opinions and discusses
6361439 do you know the city will be larger than washington
6361440 saudi arabia today doesnt offer the kind of services that are required
6361441 there is a lack of infrastructure and basic urban aesthetic beauty is also missing we have about 60 per cent of our population under 30 and these people need places to live so we are going to create the educational opportunities for them to come study and work
6361442 they are white elephants and not economically sustainable without huge subsidies
6361443 its hard to find serious economists who arent in the pay of the saudis who think it is sustainable
6361444 the king goes to parliament to talk about the need for women to participate but its all nonsense
6361445 the king has good intentions but when it goes down to lower levels there is resistance
6361446 we are putting our faith in king abdullah because obviously hes a reformist
6361447 he represents optimism and tolerance and a progressive way of thinking
6361448 if iran involves itself more in iraq and the americans tried to back the shiites well resort once more to the religious establishment
6361449 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6361450 isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything this is going for it thats our approach its pedal to the metal
6361451 we finally have enough talent on defense that we dont have to count on scoring a ton of points
6361452 we have speed maturity and were tenacious and for the first time theres depth
6361453 its the building block and springboard you want for this season
6361454 im at that point in my career where i really want to make sure we solidify ourselves as a top 20 team this year and next
6361455 i think last year we proved we could do what we have to to win games
6361456 i dont think were going to have a problem on either side of the ball
6361457 but the defense is looking like it could be the strength were a little older and developing really well
6361458 when young was out the offense controlled the ball and we led the conference in takeaways we learned how important it was to keep our offense on the field and get their offense off when camp started we were flying around like 100 000 miles an hour just playing hard and playing fast weve seen where it can take us
6361459 we like to take it one at a time and were going to do that
6361460 everything will sort itself out we feel like we owe it to ourselves to do enough to get us back to where we want and need to be
6361461 last year was tough but what we learned from that was not to leave it up to anyone else so we have to be our own committee if we win one more game then it doesnt come down to a flip of the coin
6361462 youre telling me i cant wear the same mask ive used for 3 years
6361463 diminish the skills agility initiative and morale of its intended beneficiaries
6361464 were animated by a genuine desire to improve the human condition
6361465 the conclusions that can be drawn from the failures of modern projects of social engineering are as applicable to market driven standardization as they are to bureaucratic homogeneity
6361466 certain kinds of states driven by utopian plans and an authoritarian disregard for the values desires and objections of their subjects
6361467 institutions that are instead multifunctional plastic diverse and adaptable in other words institutions that are powerfully shaped by metis
6361468 can only be established with willing members the task of government is not to try and force this kind of development but to explain encourage and participate
6361469 the rational design of social order commensurate with the scientific understanding of natural laws
6361470 was definitely not motivated by the desire to improve the human condition at best he was motivated by the desire to improve the state condition
6361471 largest forced resettlement scheme undertaken in independent africa up to that time
6361472 only by radically simplifying the settlement pattern was it possible for the state to efficiently deliver such development services as schools clinics and clean water
6361473 the metis of its citizenry should in mediated form continually modify the laws and policies of the land
6361474 with in depth research of the market and its interrelationships
6361475 even in the case of roads narrow criteria of efficiency ignore other ends that are not trivial in the case of the places that people call home narrow criteria of efficiency do considerably greater violence to human practice
6361476 the african has neither the training skill nor equipment to diagnose his soil erosion troubles nor can he plan remedial measures which are based on scientific knowledge
6361477 utopian aspirations per se are not dangerous where the utopian vision goes wrong is when it is held by ruling elites with no commitment to democracy or civil rights
6361478 a weakened civil society which lacks the capability to resist
6361479 idea of a root and branch rational engineering of entire social orders in creating realizable utopias
6361480 you spent so much time proving that you could defy manipulate nature but you never stopped to think if you should defy manipulate nature
6361481 progenitors of such plans regarded themselves as far smarter and farseeing than they really were and at the time regarded their subjects as far stupider and incompetent than they really were
6361482 to the extent that globalization and the new world order means the spread of such values violence and consumerism the antimodernists complaints are understandable even if their violence is not
6361483 values at the core of the american system and in many other parts of the world that are worth defending and reaffirming
6361484 institutions like the imf the world bank and the united nations are imposing capitalism and secular ideas on them with the aim of exterminating traditional values
6361485 both groups use selective readings of history and of religious texts to justify violence over territory
6361486 unless we understand the appeal of participating in extremist groups and the seduction of finding ones identity in opposition to other we will not get far in our attempts to stop terrorism
6361487 the imf the world bank and the united nations are imposing capitalism and secular ideas on them with the aim of exterminating traditional values
6361488 who stands to gain who is making money who is receiving benefits of any kind who is taking advantage of whom
6361489 at the national level a governments inability to provide basic services protect human rights or to maintain a monopoly on violence damages the states ability to fight extremist groups
6361490 we should encourage the condemnation of extremist interpretations of religion by peace loving practitioners what counts is what we fight for not what we oppose we need to avoid giving into spiritual dread and to hold fast to the best of our principles by emphasizing tolerance empathy and courage
6361491 many report a kind of spiritual high or addiction related to its fulfillment
6361492 when the pain of trauma is so great that the victim cannot sustain feeling he too becomes susceptible to propagating further evil
6361493 selective reading of history is a powerful tool for mobilizing terrorists seeking to settle conflicting claims to the same territory
6361494 the us needs to become as savvy at psychological warfare as the terrorists are
6361495 should change policies that no longer serve our interests or are inconsistent with out values even if those happen to be policies that the terrorists demand
6361496 people who are alienated and humiliated will tend to be attracted to extremist organizations
6361497 we need to respond not just with guns but by seeking to create confusion conflict and competition among terrorists and between terrorists and their sponsors and sympathizers
6361498 an act or threat of violence against noncombatants with the objective of exacting revenge intimidating or otherwise influencing an audience
6361499 sharing property and or signing it over to the group upon admission no compensation for labor communal work efforts
6361500 when i began this project i could not understand why the killers i met seemed spiritually intoxicated now i think i understand they seem that way because they are
6361501 any creative encounter with evil requires that we not distance ourselves from it by simply demonizing those who commit evil acts
6361502 violence against noncombatants with the objective of exacting revenge intimidating or otherwise influencing an audience
6361503 modernity introduces a world where the potential future paths are so varied so unknown and the lack of authority is so great that individuals seek assurance and comfort in the elimination of unsettling possibilities too much choice especially regarding identity can be overwhelming and even frightening
6361504 well it has its problems but liberalism is the best we can do
6361505 successful policies are very contingent on circumstances and that it is only through the exchange of information that we are able to extract the contingencies that are the relevant ones for a particular country
6361506 now that china has gone more than half way across the river what is on the other side is clearer it is clearer that are many different forms of a market economy what kind of market economy it chooses will affect what kind of society it will create
6361507 the most coherent and balanced theory of political economy that we have read this semester
6361508 it is better to be a cow in europe than to be a poor person in a developing country
6361509 may be fully committed to ending global poverty but only so long as it does not cost them anything
6361510 although international politics today is different from the way it was 30 or even 15 years ago it is still not capable of complete honesty and openness
6361511 china needs to have an innovation system which puts greater emphasis on prizes and government funded research and less emphasis on patents
6361512 actually created a global trade regime that helped their special corporate and financial interests
6361513 remarks on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome
6361514 circumstances and history differ but so too to a large extent its objectives
6361515 we should be working toward the creation of international legal frameworks and international courts as necessary for the smooth functioning of the global economy as federal courts and national laws are for national economies
6361516 some 40 of the worlds 6 5 billion people live in poverty
6361517 while those who benefit from the current system will resist change forces for change have already been set in motion
6361518 economic consequences of globalisation are outpacing our ability to understand and shape globalisation and to cope with these consequences through political processes
6361519 extract the contingencies that are the relevant ones for a particular country
6361520 without strong government re distributive policies unskilled workers may well be worse off
6361521 this will assure that once charges are dismissed the defendants will not be at risk for being taken from the country without the opportunity to address their fear of persecution which would await them when they return

6361590 around 25th september they will release a song with a new style that is predicted to overwhelm the success of so hot
6361591 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6361592 you can have good location and get the loss or bad location and get the win
6361593 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did consistently
6361594 weve always had big expectations for brett when you hand him the ball you know theres a chance he can pitch like that
6361595 it wasnt something that i could control at that point
6361596 i think we all wanted brett to finish that game just as much as he wanted to finish that game
6361597 we won three straight last october ive tried to teach our guys that successful teams do it over the course of 4 or 5 months they certainly understand what it takes and how quickly it can be taken away from you
6361598 its about focusing on the process if you can learn that the wins take care of itself everybody wants to quantify what a successful season is if these guys can achieve competitive greatness give themselves opportunities to win games theyre going to win more than their share
6361599 coach sends a really strong message that you cant be inconsistent
6361600 you cant be lazy with your practice schedule one week and go hard the next thatll come back to bite you
6361601 when we came here they laughed at us when we walked around campus right now theres a little buzz you can just feel the energy around us there are a lot of expectations we cant wait to get started
6361602 you see the predictions you just try not to read into that too much it would mean so much to leave on a good note especially after all the things weve been through i couldnt even put that into words
6361603 when we first came here i didnt really look too much into the future
6361604 wallace spearmon stepped out the second place guy stepped out
6361605 hopefully usain stepped out too thats a gold for me
6361606 this is a great feeling but if it wasnt for the soul organization and the team playing to the level we did this year i probably wouldnt have been noticed
6361607 but the century that began full of self confidence in the ultimate triumph of western liberal democracy seems at its close to be returning full circle to where it started not to an end of ideology or a convergence between capitalism and socialism as earlier predicted but to an unabashed victory of economic and political liberalism
6361608 economic and political liberalism in fact one may argue it is one of the most conservative in the sense that one protects its own markets and resources by making them closed economies to the rest of the world
6361609 the central issue is the fact that the peoples republic of china can no longer act as a beacon for illiberal forces around the world
6361610 what strange thoughts occur to people in albania or burkina faso we are interested in the common ideological heritage of mankind
6361611 the state that emerges at the end of history is liberal insofar as it recognizes and protects through a system of law mans universal right to freedom and democratic insofar as it exists only with the consent of the governed
6361612 universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
6361613 prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started once again
6361614 following in the footsteps of the united states or any liberal model to create a truly universal consumer culture that has become both a symbol and an underpinning of the universal homogeneous state
6361615 but at the end of history it is not necessary that all societies become successful liberal societies merely that they end their ideological pretensions of representing different and higher forms of human society
6361616 i want to avoid the materialistic determinism that says that liberal economics inevitably produces liberal politics
6361617 those who believe that the future must inevitably be socialist tend to be very old or very marginal to the real political discourse in their societies
6361618 je peux engloutir un pot entier de glace sans grossir idem pour les tablettes de chocolat j limine tr s vite
6361619 international finance had to cope with the conflicting ambitions and intrigues of the great and small powers its plans were thwarted by diplomatic maneuvers its long term investments jeopardized its constructive efforts hampered by political sabotage and backstairs obstruction
6361620 a market economy is an economic system controlled regulated and directed by markets alone an economy of this kind derives from the expectation that human beings behave in such a way as to achieve maximum money gains
6361621 neither must there be any interference with the adjustment of prices to changed market conditions 69
6361622 one of the possible solutions for polanyi is for the world to return to complete laissez faire to the point where politics do not interere with the market system
6361623 no less than the running of society as an adjunct to the market
6361624 to include them labor and land in the market mechanism means to subordinate the substance of society itself to the laws of the market
6361625 the primary catalyst for this great transformation came with the incorporation of foreign and international affairs in the governmental doctrine of almost every fairly industrialized nation
6361626 workers agitated against unemployment capitalists against a fragile banking system and farmers against falling prices
6361627 the economic system is in effect a mere function of social organization
6361628 willing are the people in charge to pursue such policies
6361629 the government and the people can work with one another to attain economic improvements and progress
6361630 that when political and economic motivations are no longer in harmony political and economic peace and prosperity are at risk
6361631 that all economic systems known to man up to the end of feudalism in western europe were organized on the principles of 1 reciprocity 2 redistribution and 3 householding the greek principle of householding means
6361632 accessory production for the market need not destroy the self sufficiency of the household the sale of the surpluses need not destroy the bases of householding
6361633 mans economy as a rule is submerged in his social relationships
6361634 he acts as to safeguard his social standing his social claims and his social assets he values material goods only in so far as they serve this end
6361635 symmetry and centricity will meet halfway the needs of reciprocity and redistribution institutional patterns and principles of behavior are mutually adjusted
6361636 economic logic while when one is trying to figure out the next move for the government to take one should learn from what the ideal teaches and then modify it to be an accurate description of reality
6361637 free supply of land labor and money continued to be available as long as these conditions prevailed neither man nor nature nor business organization needed protection but as soon as these conditions ceased to exist social protection set in
6361638 every individual generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention
6361639 economy directed by market prices and nothing but market prices
6361640 he acts so as to safeguard his social standing his social claims his social assets
6361641 organizations such as the imf wto and world bank were created to be intermediary bodies to control markets and regulate international trade and prevent worldwide economic crises from occurring
6361642 newspapers and even books now have to appeal to a working class public
6361643 everyone barring fools and scoundrels would like to see the miner better off
6361644 watching coal miners at work you realize momentarily what different universes people inhabit
6361645 lamp lit world down there is as necessary to the daylight world above as the root is to the flower
6361646 our civilization is founded on coal more completely than one realizes until one stops to think about it
6361647 all social notions all tastes all moral codes would have to be done away with
6361648 orwell strives not for the artificial elimination of class differences by simply dropping inherited class beliefs but for the fostering of a common goal that transcends all class boundaries
6361649 it is strange how easily most of them can lash themselves into frenzies of rage against the class to which by birth or by adoption they themselves invariable belong
6361650 set of reforms which they the clever ones are going to impose upon the lower orders
6361651 the twenty million englishmen whose bones are rotting from malnutrition
6361652 all those who cringe to the boss and all those who shudder when they think of the rent
6361653 i am implying that different classes must be persuaded to act together without for the moment being asked to drop their class differences
6361654 demands constant intercommunication and exchange of goods between all parts of the earth it demands some degree of centralized control it demands an approximately equal standard of life for all human beings and probably a certain uniformity of education
6361655 to this you have got to add the ugly fact that most middle class socialists while theoretically pining for a class less society cling like glue to their miserable fragments of social prestige
6361656 there can be no cooperation between classes whose real interests are opposed but it is always possible to cooperate so long as it is upon a basis of common interests
6361657 watching coal miners at work you realize momentarily what different universes people inhabit down there where coal is dug is a sort of world apart which one can quite easily go through life without ever hearing about
6361658 out lumps of coal the size of an egg or smaller
6361659 the more the worker produces the more worthless he becomes a slave of nature
6361660 their lamp lit world down there is as necessary to the daylight world above as the root is to the flower
6361661 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries
6361662 socialism would at least ensure our getting enough to eat even if it deprived us of everything else
6361663 is one who wishes not merely conceives it as desirable but actively wishes to see tyranny overthrown
6361664 by understanding how one class appears when seen through the eyes of another
6361665 i fancy we should let them do it rather than deprive ourselves of coal but most of the time of course we should prefer to forget that they were doing it it is so with all types of manual work it keeps us alive and we are oblivious of its existence
6361666 democracy is impossible without enlightenment of people and education of people is impossible without democracy
6361667 we all rail against class distinctions but very few people seriously want to abolish them
6361668 the missing piece to socialism is that there is no drive for man to accomplish anything more than the status quo
6361669 what the middle class so often forgets that socialism means justice and common decency
6361670 anytime you can go out there and throw a complete game its awesome
6361671 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation anytime that happens its great
6361672 thats huge anytime you can get that kind of run support early in the game it kind of takes pressure off you
6361673 you dont have to be as perfect you have a little cushion and it allows you to relax
6361674 its great that were in a little bit of a groove now but we cant get ahead of ourselves
6361675 these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test
6361676 those who rule have little to no interaction with those who are affected by their policies
6361677 the great advantage of such tunnel vision is that it brings into sharp focus certain limited aspects of an otherwise far more complex and unwieldy reality
6361678 uncritically admiring of the local the traditional and the customary
6361679 the long term survival of certain human institutions is something of a tribute to their adaptability
6361680 radically simplified designs for social organization seem to court the same risk of failure courted by radically simplified designs for natural environments
6361681 a human community is surely far too complicated and variable to easily yield its secrets to bureaucratic formulae
6361682 can only be established with willing members the task of government is not to try and force this kind of development but to explain encourage and participate
6361683 i am no longer interested in systems of organization organized institutes tend to produce patternized prisoners of a systematized concept and the instructors are often fixed in a routine of course what is worse is that by imposing the members to fit a lifeless pre formation their natural growth is blocked
6361684 one of my favorite cases about the power of incentives is the federal express case the heart and soul of the integrity of the system is that all the packages have to be shifted rapidly in one central location each night and the system has no integrity if the whole shift cant be done fast and federal express had one hell of a time getting the thing to work and they tried moral suasion they tried everything in the world and finally somebody got the happy thought that they were paying the night shift by the hour and that maybe if they paid them by the shift the system would work better and lo and behold that solution worked
6361685 one could say that democracy itself is based on the assumption that the metis of its citizenry should in mediated form continually modify the laws and policies of the land
6361686 integral finally to le corbusiers ultramodernism was his repudiation of tradition history and received taste he warned we must refuse even the slightest consideration to what is to the mess we are in now
6361687 at the very least we are in the presence of a dictatorship of the planner at most we approach a cult of power and remorselessness that is reminiscent of fascist imagery le corbusier sees himself as a technical genius and demands power in the name of his truths
6361688 she was also a political activist involved in many campaigns against proposals for zoning changes road building and housing development she thought ill advised

6361690 those who rule have little to no interaction with those who are affected by their policies
6361691 dangers due to dismembering an exceptionally complex and poorly understood set of relations and processes in order to isolate a single element of instrumental value in the case of the forest analogy the single element would be the maximization of wood resources
6361692 how actual work processes depend more heavily on informal understandings and improvisations than formal work rules
6361693 much of this book can be read as a case against the imperialism of high modernist planned social order i stress the word imperialism here because i am emphatically not making a blanket case against either bureaucratic planning or high modernist ideology i am however making a case against imperial or hegemonic planning mentality that excludes the necessary role of local knowledge and know how
6361694 this book is not meant to argue for as little state intervention as possible
6361695 actions far from being cynical grabs for power and wealth were animated by genuine desire to improve the human condition
6361696 were guilty of hubris of forgetting that they were mortals and acting as if they were gods
6361697 itself an instituted formal system of coordination despite the elbow room that it provides to its participants
6361698 no matter what political affiliation we profess we should not try to create a perfect solution but instead be motivated by humbler ideals that look less like religious fervor

6361724 they were concerned about the sharp drop off in our power consumption
6361725 instead of economy being embedded in social relations social relations are embedded in the economic system
6361726 propensity to barter truck and exchange is almost entirely apocryphal
6361727 the orderly production and distribution of goods was secured through a great variety of individual motives disciplined by general principles of behavior
6361728 could not exist for any length of time without annihilating the human and natural substance of society
6361729 regulating the course of change so that it became bearable and its effects could be canalized into less destructive avenues
6361730 the market system will no longer be self regulating even in principle since it will not comprise labor land and money
6361731 laissez faire economy was the product of deliberate state action subsequent restrictions on liassez faire started in a spontaneous way
6361732 was not the result of any inherent tendency of markets
6361733 subordinates the substance of society itself to the laws of the market
6361734 the tendency inherent in an industrial civilization to transcend the self regulating market consciously subordinating it to a democratic society
6361735 the passing of the market economy can become the beginning of an era of unprecedented freedom
6361736 alter the rate of change speeding it up or slowing it down as the case may be
6361737 nineteenth century civilization was not destroyed by the external or internal attack of barbarians it disintegrated as the result of the measures which society adopted in order not to be in its turn annialated by the action of the self regulating market
6361738 within the nations we are witnessing a development under which the economic system ceases to lay down the law to society and the primacy of society over that system is secured
6361739 right to non conformity is the hallmark of a free society
6361740 born as a mere penchant for non bureaucratic methods and evolved into a veritable faith in mans secular salvation through a self regulating market
6361741 how does society evolve when it is a mold forced upon its members
6361742 labor land and money cannot be allowed to take the form of commodities they must be regulated by the government and in so doing the economy will be subordinated to society subsequently eliminating personal gain as the predominant social incentive
6361743 what you think is the best way to build on polanyis insights to manage the border where economic logic meets political objectives
6361744 the laboring people had been crowded together in new places of desolation
6361745 the intersection between political and economic logic with regard to land labor and money being treated as
6361746 was a political movement that responded to the needs of an objective situation at the same time the degenerative character of the fascist solution was evident
6361747 reeducate people in order to denaturalize the individual and make him unable to function as the responsible unit of the body politic
6361748 the tendency inherent in an industrial civilization to transcend the self regulating market by consciously subordinating it to a democratic society
6361749 to include land and labor in the market mechanism means to subordinate the substance of society itself to the laws of the market
6361750 the idea of a self adjusting market implied a stark utopia
6361751 the history of mankind provides little support for adam smiths notion and that prior to the creation of the self regulating market people relied on the systems of reciprocity householding and redistribution in order to exchange goods
6361752 the passing of the market economy can become the beginning of an era of unprecedented freedom gt
6361753 where we must not pretend that regualtion does not exist and we are governed by an
6361754 market economy if left to evolve according to its own laws would create great and permanent evils
6361755 to include them in the market mechanism means to subordinate the substance of society itself to the laws of the market
6361756 fate of human beings and their natural environment would result in the demolition of society
6361757 should the government regulate the market or should it be self regulated
6361758 polanyi argues that a self regulating market was not the result of any inherent tendency of markets 57 instead it was the result of utopian endeavors of economic liberalism 29 fueled by the sole motive of gain
6361759 im not a big name like jeff gordon and dale earnhardt jr im not flashy thats good im happy where we are

6361772 the end of history will be a very sad time the struggle for recognition the willingness to risk ones life for a purely abstract goal the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring courage imagination and idealism will be replaced by economic calculation the endless solving of technical problems environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands in the post historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history i can feel in myself and see in others around me a powerful nostalgia for the time when history existed
6361773 does not by any means imply the end of international conflict per se
6361774 fundamental contradictions in human life that cannot be resolved in the context of modern liberalism
6361775 it is hard to believe that the movement will take on any universal significance
6361776 other less organized religious impulses have been successfully satisfied within the sphere of personal life that is permitted in liberal societies
6361777 the larger and more developed states of the world who after all account for the greater part of world politics
6361778 absolute moment a moment in which a final rational form of society and state became victorious
6361779 our task is not to answer exhaustively the challenges to liberalism promoted by every crackpot messiah around the world but only those that are embodied in important social or political forces and movements and which are therefore part of world history
6361780 the root cause of economic inequality do not have to do with the underlying legal and social structure of our society which remains fundamentally egalitarian and moderately redistributionist so much as with cultural and social characteristics
6361781 in the post historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy
6361782 universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
6361783 failure to understand that the roots of economic behavior lie in the realm of consciousness and culture leads to the common mistake of attributing material causes to phenomena that are essentially ideal in nature
6361784 it is the ideal that will govern the material world in the long run
6361785 but at the end of history it is not necessary that all societies become successful liberal societies merely that they end their ideological pretensions of representing different and higher forms of human society
6361786 are there any fundamental contradictions in human life that cant be resolved by modern liberalism or alternative political economic structure
6361787 a lack of ambition to find alternatives to make the world better
6361788 a non profit educational organization dedicated to a few fundamental propositions that american leadership is good both for america and for the world and that such leadership requires military strength diplomatic energy and commitment to moral principle
6361789 foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes american principles abroad
6361790 what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war or the passing of a particular period of postwar history but the end of history as such that is the end point of mankinds ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
6361791 embodied in important social or political forces and movements which are therefore part of world history
6361792 large scale conflict must involve large states still caught in the grip of history and they are what appear to be passing from the scene
6361793 perhaps this very prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started once again
6361794 the end point of mankinds ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
6361795 our task is not to answer exhaustively the challenges to liberalism promoted by every crackpot messiah around the world but only those that are embodied in important social or political forces and movements and which are therefore part of world history
6361796 crackpot messiahs but i feel that the idea of hitler is a somewhat tricky case because he was this terrible figure who is behind a world war but hitler was elected by a democratic majority and therefore his movement is very legitimate
6361797 for human history and the conflict that characterized it was based on the existence of
6361798 as close to a modern utopian movement as it can get
6361799 the contradictions that drive history exist first of all in the realm of human consciousness i e on the level of ideas
6361800 the struggle for recognition the willingness to risk ones life for a purely abstract goal the worldwide ideological struggle that call s forth daring courage imagination and idealism
6361801 any fundamental contradictions in human life can be resolved in the context of modern liberalism
6361802 liberal democracy is obviously not a perfect system and people have an inherent habit of striving to obtain a utopian society
6361803 democracy is the worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried
6361804 the end point of mankinds ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
6361805 at the end of history it is not necessary that all societies become successful liberal societies
6361806 there are currently over 20 000 chinese students studying in the u s and other western countries almost all of them the children of the chinese elite it is hard to believe that when they return home to run the country they will be content for china to be the only country in asia unaffected by the larger democratizing trend the student demonstrations in beijing that broke out first in december 1986 and recurred recently on the occasion of hu death were only the beginning of what will inevitably be mounting pressure for change in the political system as well
6361807 this is certainly not what happened to china after it began its reform process chinese competitiveness and expansionism on the world scene have virtually disappeared beijing no longer sponsors maoist insurgencies or tries to cultivate influence in distant african countries as it did in the 1960s
6361808 what is important from a hegelian standpoint is that political liberalism has been following economic liberalism more slowly than many had hoped but with seeming inevitability
6361809 the stupid speak of the past the wise of the present fools of the future
6361810 the art of government is not to let men grow stale
6361811 the victory of the ideals of the french revolution and the imminent universalization of the state incorporating the principles of liberty and equality
6361812 the endless solving of technical problems environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands
6361813 far eastern societies the ethic of work and saving and family a religious heritage that does not like islam place restrictions on certain forms of economic behavior and other deeply ingrained moral qualities are equally important in explaining their economic performance
6361814 the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race posterity as well as the existing generation those who dissent from the opinion still more than those who hold it if the opinion is right they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth if wrong they lose what is almost as great a benefit the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth produced by collision with error
6361815 our task is not to answer exhaustively the challenges to liberalism promoted by every crackpot messiah around the world but only those that are embodied in important social or political forces and movements and which are therefore part of world history
6361816 the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race posterity as well as the existing generation those who dissent from the opinion still more than those who hold it if the opinion is right they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth if wrong they lose what is almost as great a benefit the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth produced by collision with error
6361817 our task is not to answer exhaustively the challenges to liberalism promoted by every crackpot messiah around the world but only those that are embodied in important social or political forces and movements and which are therefore part of world history
6361818 the ideal that will govern the material world in the long run
6361819 will be replaced by economic calculation the endless solving of technical problems environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands
6361820 fundamentally the biggest issue is the gap between rich and poor
6361821 we demand countries choose idealist security policies in keeping with our vision but act most of the time to futher our own interests often at the expense of the rest of the world
6361822 people join religious terrorist groups partly to transform themselves and to simplify life they start out feeling humiliated enraged that they are viewed by some other as second class
6361823 in their view arrogant one worlders humanists and promoters of human rights have created an engine of modernity that is stealing the identity of the oppressed the greatest rage and the threat stems from those who feel they cant keep up even as they claim to be superior to those that can

6361826 we demand countries to choose idealist security policies to keep with our vision but act most of the time to further our own interests often at the expense of the rest of the world
6361827 a few years ago i decided to do something scholars rarely do i decided to talk with terrorists
6361828 seeks out structural and psychological explanations for terrorism instead of just assuming that these phenomena arise of their own volition
6361829 jihad is a lucrative undertaking managers and trainers are relatively well paid
6361830 a great force he goes from organization to organization persuading people to donate money or donate their lives to jihad
6361831 we demand that other countries open their markets to our goods even as we maintain protections on ours
6361832 al qaeda is more interested in their well being than is the united states
6361833 if all lives were acknowledged as equally human and worthy terrorism would probably not exist on such a prevalent scale or maybe not at all
6361834 perhaps the most truly evil aspect of religious terrorism is that it aims at destroying moral distinctions themselves
6361835 fundamentally the biggest issue is the gap between rich and poor
6361836 christian cult called the covenant the sward and the arm of the lord

6361839 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change initial reports are at least 11 killed and many wounded
6361840 we are very very close to an agreement but its not done
6361841 undoubtedly its true that the negotiators have taken this very very far towards an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement
6361842 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6361843 i am not going into the details now where we are on in specific issues except to say i think all issues have moved forward in a positive way
6361844 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6361845 obviously i will also check progress on the negotiations on the strategic frameworks agreement and on an agreement to allow our forces to continue to operate in iraq after the expiration of the united nations security council resolution

6361853 better wages and shorter hours and nobody bossing you about
6361854 there is no one in england who does not wish to see a better standard of living for the working class
6361855 and it was here that those few months in the militia were valuable to me for the spanish militias while they lasted were a sort of microcosm of a classless society in that community where no one was on the make where there was a shortage of everything but no privilege and no boot licking one got perhaps a crude forecast of what the opening stages of socialism might be like
6361856 instituting socialist education programs aimed at explaining the true essence of socialism
6361857 probably we could do with a little less talk about capitalist and proletarian and a little more about the robbers and the robbed
6361858 there is a quite obvious danger that in the next few years large sections of the middle class will make a sudden and violent swing to the right
6361859 most of them are clinging to their gentility under the impression that it keeps them afloat
6361860 in order to decide if you are genuinely in favor of socialism you have got to decide whether things at present are tolerable or not tolerable
6361861 drop that misleading habit of pretending that the only proletarians are manual labourers
6361862 to get rid of class distinctions you have got to start by understanding how one class appears when seen through the eyes of another
6361863 we all rail against class distinctions but very few people seriously want to abolish them
6361864 while theoretically pining for a class less society cling like glue to their miserable fragments of social prestige
6361865 it grew up more or less concurrently with industrialism it has always had its roots in the town proletariat and the town intellectual and it is doubtful whether it could ever have arisen in any but an industrial society
6361866 the ordinary man may not flinch from a dictatorship of the proletariat if you offer it tactfully offer him a dictatorship of the prigs and he gets ready to fight
6361867 revolts against anyone with a feeling of tradition or rudiments of an aesthetic sense
6361868 the question is not really about class differences rather it is about the cleavage between exploiter and exploited
6361869 watching coal miners at work you realize momentarily what different universes people inhabit
6361870 fat wicked man in a top hat and fur coat
6361871 forget their incomes and remember their accents and fly to the defence of the class that is exploiting them
6361872 to get rid of class distinctions you have got to start by understanding how one class appears when seen through the eyes of another
6361873 the idea that we must all cooperate seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system
6361874 we all rail against class distinctions but very few people seriously want to abolish them
6361875 we could bring up the proletariat to the bourgeoisies level
6361876 enough weve seen what can happen when the means to making people better off whether the market or state ownership overshadow the true end which should be providing the majority of people with a life they can call well off we all want a prosperous europe lets make this work
6361877 got what youd expect for 10 shillings bed in the attic and bread and butter
6361878 offered an escape from an institutional deadlock which was essentially alike in a large number of countries
6361879 the only person who can persuade yourself is yourself you must turn the issues over in your mind at leisure consider the many arguments let them simmer and after as long time turn your preferences into cinviction
6361880 we can ensure that the private sector is a check on the powers of the government sector and an effective protection of freedom of speech religion and thought
6361881 if i do not like what my local community does be it sewage disposal or zoning or schools i can move to another local community and though few may take this step the mere possibility acts as a check
6361882 the citizen of the us who is compelled by law to devote something like 10 of his income to the purchase of a particular kind of retirement contract is being deprived a corresponding part of his personal freedom
6361883 much of the actual inequality derives from imperfections of the market
6361884 many of these ahve been created by gavernment action or could be removed by governement action
6361885 the evil men in the kremlin who promise to bury us
6361886 a system of economic freedom and a necessary condition for political freedom
6361887 neighborhood effects cut both ways they can be a reason for limiting the activities of government as well as expanding them
6361888 underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself
6361889 the federal reserve system exercised monetary policy responsibility so ineptly as to convert what otherwise would have been a moderate contraction into a major catastrophe
6361890 a testament to how much harm can be done by mistakes on the part of a few men when they yield vast power over the monetary system of a country
6361891 the subsidy being independent of the receivers poverty or wealth
6361892 the basic roles of government in a free society to provide a means whereby we can modify the rules to mediate differences among us on the meaning of the rules and to enforce compliance with the rules
6361893 to do something that the market cannot do for itself namely to determine arbitrate and enforce the rules
6361894 his worst mistake in my opinion was his na vete about human nature
6361895 original sense as the doctrines pertaining to a free man
6361896 you must not have worked hard enough i know many people who worked their way up from the bottom and if you cant you deserve to be destitute
6361897 rules of the game and as an umpire to interpret and enforce the rules decided on
6361898 means the absence of coercion of a man by his fellow men
6361899 economic promotes political freedom because it separates economic power from political power and in this way enables the one to offset the other
6361900 fundamental differences in basic values can seldom if ever be resolved at the ballot box ultimately they can only be decided though not resolved by conflict the religious and civil wars of history are a bloody testament to this judgment
6361901 it is clear that the difference between the actual operation of the market and its ideal operation great though it undoubtedly is is nothing as compared to the difference between the actual effects of government intervention and their intended effects
6361902 we could say to the rest of the world we believe in freedom and intend to practice it no one can force you to be free
6361903 as someone arguing that the welfare state has gone too far
6361904 does not feel like she is being robbed of her economic freedom
6361905 to protect our freedom both from outside enemies and from our fellow citizens
6361906 preserve law and order as well as enforce private contracts safeguard private property and foster competitive markets
6361907 friedman attempts to debunk the social democratic theory of government intervention espoused by keynes and polanyi by arguing that the government despite its best intentions often does more harm than good his argument is well written and persuasive to a degree but polanyi convinced me in the great transformation that the self regulating market left to its own devices is extremely destructive
6361908 to provide a means whereby we can modify the rules to mediate differences among us on the meaning of the rules and to enforce compliance with the rules
6361909 exercised monetary policy responsibility so ineptly as to convert what otherwise would have been a moderate contraction into a major catastrophe
6361910 imperfections of the market have been created by government action or could be removed by government action
6361911 the existence of a free market does not of course eliminate the need for government
6361912 any system which gives so much power and so much discretion to a few men that mistakes excusable or not can have such far reaching effects is a bad system
6361913 a stable and democratic society is impossible without a minimum degree of literacy and knowledge on the part of most citizens and without widespread acceptance of some common set of values
6361914 a system of floating exchange rates which would enable us to proceed effectively and directly towards complete free trade in goods and services barring interference on strictly political and military grounds
6361915 markets are inefficient because of market externalities namely imperfect or asymmetrical information transaction costs and the dynamic and structural instability of markets

6361919 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6361920 because the details are so important there are often unintended consequences of well intentioned policies
6361921 it is not just income that matters but standard of living
6361922 markets governments and individuals are the pillars of successful development strategy
6361923 mostly an attempt to reconcile the classical problem of liberalism the tension between individual liberty and societal equality
6361924 you know america is doing something wrong i know people who knew germans who survived world war ii these germans said you know i remember we were starving when the americans dropped parachutes with bananas we didnt know what they were we didnt even know to peel them we ate them whole and for that i will never forget the americans regardless of sides now the thing that america is doing wrong now is starving these people abroad
6361925 uncertified sierra leone diamonds are now know as conflict diamonds this public recognition of the role of resources in financing a conflict and the acknowledgement that it must be curtailed is a move in the right direction
6361926 but the major barrier to increasing consumption is not a lack of credit but the lack of an effective social safety net a strong public health system an effective social security system and a good publicly provided education precautionary savings depresses consumption
6361927 making firms pay the full marginal social cost of their activities the cost say of carbon emissions would enhance incentives for pollution reducing innovation a carbon tax would have in addition one further important advantage it could break the global impasse on what to do about global warming the scientific evidence about the risks of this impending calamity has been mounting
6361928 interpretations of what has succeeded and what has failed based partly on an enormous number of experiments
6361929 rather than simply look at output growth and decide that chinas policies have been successful stiglitz provides a model for a fair system of growth that encourages increases in the standard of living and fair economic distribution
6361930 dialogue is important it enhances the likelihood that good decisions get made
6361931 having dialogue is important both to provide better information knowledge but also as an important check against the role of ideology in development which has been a real source of problems
6361932 for if we who share this small planet are to live in peace we must see ourselves as not only citizens of our local communities and our nations but of this world
6361933 should simply open up their markets to poorer ones without reciprocity
6361934 the problem today with globalization is that economic globalization has outpaced political globalization
6361935 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6361936 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6361937 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6361938 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6361939 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6361940 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6361941 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6361942 to tell you the truth i just want to chill out right now
6361943 i want to sleep i wish i was in sandals right now
6361944 hes lively hes fun he plays to the crowd i mean his last names bolt and hes only 21
6361945 right now in jamaica the rum is flowing and the reggae is playing
6361946 we have the best coffee in the world we had bob marley who gave the world a new religion
6361947 and we have usain bolt he means so much in every corner of jamaica every man every woman every child
6361948 hes got to get to 26 27 28 before he hits his prime
6361949 this is a fast track i told myself that if im going to get that world record im going to get it here
6361950 i knew i would go that fast ive been running fast times and shutting down at the end
6361951 poor judgment was used by bringing an airsoft gun one that can be purchased at wal mart on campus that can shoot plastic bbs
6361952 were not going to have any comment until that process is complete
6361953 contradictions in human life that cannot be resolved in the context of modern liberalism
6361954 for our purposes it matters very little what strange thoughts occur to people in albania or burkina faso for we are interested in what one could in some sense call the common ideological heritage of mankind
6361955 all societies end their ideological pretensions of representing different and higher forms of human society
6361956 all societies end their ideological pretensions of representing different and higher forms of human society
6361957 the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
6361958 the product of the pasts interaction with the present and future
6361959 end their ideological pretensions of representing different and higher forms of human society
6361960 the willingness to risk ones life for a purely abstract goal will be replaced
6361961 part that was historical and a part that was post historical
6361962 to say that history ended in 1806 meant that mankinds ideological evolution ended in the ideals of the french or american revolutions while while particular regimes in the real world might not implement these ideals fully their theoretical truth is absolute and could not be improved upon
6361963 a political system marked not only by free and fair elections but also by the rule of law a separation of powers and the protection of basic liberties of speech assembly religion and property
6361964 the right of one nation to rule over other nations without regard for the wishes of the ruled
6361965 but in the universal homogenous state all prior contradictions are resolved and all human needs are satisfied
6361966 modern liberalism itself was historically a consequence of the weakness of religiously based societies which failing to agree on the nature of the good life could not provide even the minimal preconditions of peace and stability
6361967 what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war or the passing of a particular period of post war history but the end of history as such that is the end point of mankinds ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
6361968 rather than being the pattern for asias future has become an anachronism
6361969 the state that emerges at the end of history is liberal insofar as it recognizes and protects through a system of law mans universal right to freedom and democratic insofar as it exists only with the consent of the governed
6361970 the end of history will be a very sad time the struggle for recognition the willingness to risk ones life for a purely abstract goal the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring courage imagination and idealism will be replaced by economic calculation the endless solving of technical problems environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands
6361971 if history hasnt taught us anything else it has definitely showed us that anything can happen especially when it comes to political and economic change or differences
6361972 instead of singing the advent of the ideal of liberal democracy and of the capitalist market in the euphoria of the end of history instead of celebrating the end of ideologies let us never neglect this obvious macroscopic fact made up of innumerable singular sites of suffering no degree of progress allows one to ignore that never before in absolute figures have so many men women and children been subjugated starved or exterminated on the earth
6361973 the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
6361974 centuries of boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started again
6361975 if we admit for the moment that the fascist and communist challenges to liberalism are dead are there any other ideological competitors left or put another way are there contradictions in liberal society beyond that of class that are not resolvable
6361976 large scale conflict must involve large states still caught in the grip of history and they are what appear to be passing from the scene
6361977 there will be neither art nor philosophy just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history
6361978 not likely to join the developed nations of the west as liberal societies any time in the foreseeable future
6361979 replaced by economic calculation the endless solving of technical problems environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumers
6361980 the struggle between two opposiong systems is no longer a determining tendancy of the present day era at the modern stage the ability to build up material wealth at an accelarated rate on the basis of front ranking science and high level techniques and technology and to distribute it fairly and through joint efforts to restore and protect the resources necessary for mankindss survival acquires decisive importance
6361981 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6361982 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6361983 i told them i would double the purse to 500 000
6361984 i would add an additional 250 000 for each jewel of the triple crown a horse in the race has won
6361985 we really like that the people took to big brown i like the turf course better its less money but weve had good karma there its the race track that makes the most sense for us were definitely more likely to run at monmouth
6361986 we are working hard to achieve our targets as this ensures our services continue to develop and improve
6361987 we believe it is important that our local communities take part in the annual review and have the opportunity to ask questions about our performance
6361988 give credit where its due but also to tackle tough issues and drive forward improvements
6361989 at this years annual reviews extra time has been allocated to allow additional questions from members of the public attending the review
6361990 t siant sensacij tem j netruks ir pa iose laidose per lnk startuoja nauja kasdien bulvarin laida

6361992 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6361993 we were in agreement a month and a half ago rob manfred and i
6361994 were going to move forward with the understanding the sides will come to the table later and iron out some of the remaining issues
6361995 ive watched sammy throughout the years tying him its ok i guess
6361996 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6361997 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6361998 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6361999 senza di essi il mondo potrebbe non essere come lo conosciamo e amiamo oggi
6362000 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6362001 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6362002 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6362003 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6362004 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6362005 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6362006 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6362007 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6362008 the police were requesting our high volume pump to pump out water blocking the road so that traffic could be free flowing once the leeds festival is up and running
6362009 appliances are there at the moment and will be there for some time
6362010 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6362011 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6362012 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6362013 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6362014 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6362015 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6362016 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6362017 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6362018 it was unbelievable you just have to look at the scoreboard
6362019 we have the confidence to win a gold medal for africa
6362020 it was the greatest game for everyone and fortunately we managed to win it
6362021 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6362022 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6362023 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6362024 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6362025 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6362026 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6362027 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6362028 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6362029 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6362030 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6362031 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6362032 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6362033 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6362034 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6362035 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6362036 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6362037 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6362038 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6362039 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6362040 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6362041 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6362042 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6362043 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6362044 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6362045 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6362046 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6362047 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6362048 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6362049 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6362050 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6362051 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6362052 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6362053 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6362054 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6362055 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6362056 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6362057 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6362058 a member of staff had been preparing some information for local media outlets and pressed the wrong button which led to it being published on the website
6362059 it was a regrettable human mistake and it should not have gone up
6362060 we are delighted by the high level of achievement of all the girls and boys
6362061 it is particularly pleasing to see a record number of a a grades from this year group this underlines both their ability and their great potential as they begin their as courses in september
6362062 listen i dont know if youve heard about our special celebrity mission you know we have actors in hollywood that are our spies around the world
6362063 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6362064 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6362065 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6362066 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6362067 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6362068 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6362069 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6362070 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6362071 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6362072 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6362073 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6362074 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6362075 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6362076 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6362077 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6362078 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6362079 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6362080 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6362081 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6362082 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6362083 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6362084 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6362085 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6362086 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6362087 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6362088 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6362089 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6362090 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6362091 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6362092 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6362093 a proibi o de freq entar dois cursos de n vel superior em institui o p blica encontra amparo na constitui o sob a premissa de que tal restri o asseguraria a democratiza o de acesso ao ensino superior
6362094 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6362095 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6362096 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6362097 so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6362098 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6362099 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6362100 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6362101 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6362102 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6362103 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6362104 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6362105 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6362106 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6362107 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6362108 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6362109 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6362110 this horrendous scenario is something that we must address without flinching
6362111 what is eluding us in our planning and delivery of services and why is it that the prevalence is increasing fastest among the child bearing age group of married couples
6362112 this is a grim picture and the future for our country will have serious consequences if we do not pay attention to what is needed
6362113 what are we doing about increasing psychosocial care to our sick and traumatized children
6362114 we have a moral obligation and i am convinced that in this country we can reduce the number of infections

6362124 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6362125 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6362126 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6362127 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6362128 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6362129 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6362130 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6362131 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6362132 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6362133 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6362134 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6362135 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

6362140 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

6362142 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6362143 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6362144 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6362145 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6362146 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6362147 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6362148 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6362149 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6362152 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6362153 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6362154 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6362155 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6362156 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6362157 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6362158 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6362159 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6362160 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6362161 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6362162 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6362163 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6362164 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6362165 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6362166 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6362167 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6362168 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6362169 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6362170 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6362171 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6362172 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6362173 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6362174 it is the class based elitism that instinctively wants to ration success and cap the aspirations of the less advantaged the underlying premise is that there is a fixed pool of talent in society so every august we are told that increased success rates demonstrate declining standards in state schools increased success in private schools by contrast is usually put down to hard work and good teaching i reject this ration book view of talent and opportunity it was a bad recipe for the 20th century and is a disastrous one for the 21st successful societies flourish above all else by mobilising talent and educational potential there is no genetic or moral reason why the whole of society should not succeed to the degree that the children of the professional classes do today virtually all getting five or more good gcses and staying on in education beyond 16
6362175 as education minister in a government that funds at record levels elite sports elite universities elite music and drama and gifted and talented programmes in state schools i am an unabashed elitist
6362176 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6362177 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados

6362183 the kind of economic organization that provides economic freedom directly namely competitive capitalism also promotes political freedom because it separates economic power from political power and in its way enables the one to offset the other
6362184 separates economic power from political power and in this way enable the one to offset the other
6362185 determining the rules of the game and as a umpire to interpret and enforce the rules decided on 15
6362186 ventures by small amounts from many people without first persuading them 18
6362187 economic freedom is also an indispensable means toward the achievement of political freedom
6362188 capitalism leads to less inequality than alternative systems of organization and the development of capitalism has greatly lessened the extent of inequality
6362189 every act of the government limits the area of individual freedom directly and threatens the preservation of freedom indirectly
6362190 competitive capitalism promotes political freedom because it separates economic power from political power and in this way enables the one to offset the other
6362191 essential both as a forum for determining the rules of the game and as an umpire to interpret and enforce the rules decided on
6362192 what is good for general motors is good for the us
6362193 what is good for wall street is all what matters
6362194 government is necessary to preserve our freedom it is an instrument through which we can exercise our freedom yet by concentrating power in political hands it is also a threat to freedom
6362195 the kind of economic organization that provides economic freedom directly namely competitive capitalism also promotes political freedom because it separates economic power from political power and in its way enables the one to offset the other
6362196 preserve our freedom which it is an instrument through which we can exercise our freedom
6362197 if funds are being used to help the poor would they not be used more effectively by being given in cash rather than in kind surely the families being helped would rather have been given the sum in cash than in the form of housing they could themselves spend the money on housing if they so desired hence they would never be worse off if given cash if they regarded other needs as more important they would be better off

6362200 investment should be carried to the point at which the extra return repays the investment and yields the market rate of interest on it if the investment is a human being the extra return takes the form of a higher payment for the individuals services than he could otherwise command
6362201 to deny that the end justifies the means is indirectly to assert that the end in question is not the ultimate end that the ultimate end is itself the use of the proper means desirable or not any end that can be attained only by the use of bad means must give way to the more basic end of the use of acceptable means
6362202 we now have several decades of experience with governmental intervention it is no longer necessary to compare the market as it actually operates and government intervention as it ideally might operate we can compare the actual with the actual
6362203 there is no formula which can tell us where to stop we must rely on our ability to persuade our fellow men that it is a correct judgment or their ability to persuade us to modify our views we must put our faith here as elsewhere in a consensus reached by imperfect and biased men through free discussion and trial and error

6362240 its now clear that a greater number of affluent consumers are being careful with their hard earned dollars during this economic downturn
6362241 we think its going to bring in a new customer and our existing customers for occasions they otherwise dont come to us for so the new sandwiches will increase both frequency and reach
6362242 it really gives us the opportunity to spend the entire time on the sandwiches and fresh ingredients
6362243 we are really working on the duality of the brand because thats something unique to dq we arent walking away from treats but we are trying to establish our credentials as a full menu qsr
6362244 hot sandwiches with flat bread give one an option of a smaller snack a light lunch or dinner on the run it bridges all of those
6362245 they can be seen as more of a knife and fork meal at a casual restaurant and a hotter option both in temperature and trendiness at qsr restaurants flat bread is lower in calories than traditional buns so the flat bread sandwiches can be made at a lower calorie point without having to add low calorie contents
6362246 we know these players are well liked and relevant to the ny area

6362255 i thought things would be bad enough but they turned out to be a lot worse

6362257 dont be brave run away live to fight another day
6362258 over our several decades of investment management experience we have witnessed many business cycle recessions and stock market declines
6362259 we believe the market has more than discounted all the bad news out there and is putting the finishing touches to the bottoming process for stocks yes a significant advance is set to begin that will take stocks much higher in the year ahead
6362260 considering all the negative financial headlines is it any wonder investor psychology has reached a gloomy extreme legendary value investor and philanthropist sir john templeton made a career and fortune taking advantage of bargains that showed up during recessionary periods and bear markets his foremost investment discipline was geared to wait patiently for stock prices to reach the point of maximum pessimism and then he invested it is somewhat ironic that this pioneer of value investing who began his career in the 1930s would pass away this month at the age of 95 just when the markets have hit an emotional low point we know sir john would be buying stocks during todays financial turmoil investor psychology has reached that pessimistic extreme and conversely sets up the year ahead to be a very profitable one

6362263 you know its a crazy day when you have to yell at the people fishing on the beach to reel in their lines
6362264 theres no question about it wall street got drunk it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
6362265 i guess everybody thinks the fed or the treasury is going to bail the whole economy out why worry if youre in trouble call mr bernanke and hell drop a bundle of federal reserve notes in your mail box be sure the box is big enough
6362266 though fiscal stimulus will provide a lingering boost to 3q we expect gdp to plummet 2 5 in 4q and see a similar decline in 1q in all we have shaved our 2009 gdp forecast to 0 5 a full percentage point lower than where it was previously while 2008 is broadly unchanged at 1 5
6362267 it is important to recognize that the fed is not in a position to raise rates until there is financial market stability the housing market crisis improves and firms decide to expand their payrolls concerns about economic growth will prevail over inflation for now in other words tough talk about inflation will continue but it cannot be translated into action in the near term
6362268 predicting is among the most hazardous of professions as you know because we can only guess nevertheless we need to focus on these challenging questions so here are my guesses
6362269 us 30 year treasury bond futures i think bill gross deficit forecast is probably right and i also maintain that the us government will err on the side of inflation as debtor nations invariably do
6362270 the us dollar index while the us government does not want a currency freefall it can ill afford a strong dollar because it needs an export led recovery
6362271 gold in a fiat currency world with the main reserve unit enfeebled and resources inflation continuing when global gdp growth increases people everywhere will continue to regard gold as real money for investment purposes
6362272 crude oil assuming and very much hoping that there will not be a military strike against irans nuclear installations i maintain that oil has peaked for the medium term defined as anything from a few months to two years and occasionally even longer however as with gold and many other resources there is a scarcity factor for oil resulting from increasing costs of production and finite supplies of light crude also demand will rise following any significant correction in prices not least because cheaper oil will boost gdp growth therefore crude oil will eventually resume its secular uptrend following what i suspect will be a lengthy correction tactically i would consider longs in petroleum futures and also oil drillers and equipment stocks on evidence of renewed support building following a significant setback
6362273 just like consumers who are insulating their windows and making fewer trips to the malls we are adjusting our economic forecast to the new high oil price reality not to mention the latest round of trauma in the mortgage markets merrill lynch july 18 2008 and mark gilbert

6362276 regional fed president stern was the latest hawk at the fomc to voice his concern about inflation
6362277 federal reserve bank of philadelphia charles plosser said higher mortgage costs and continued declines in house prices pose no bar to raising interest rates
6362278 policy makers must increase borrowing costs before inflation expectations become unhinged plosser said in an interview with bloomberg television today at his banks headquarters
6362279 the philadelphia fed chief joins gary stern head of the central banks minneapolis branch in judging that policy makers shouldnt wait for an end to the housing recession before acting
6362280 the question becomes how long are we willing to allow the pressure from a fairly accommodative monetary policy stance to last before it begins to feed broad based inflation plosser said in a separate interview with bloomberg news today
6362281 plosser and stern have said raising rates before the housing slump ends isnt out of the question while dallas fed president richard fisher dissented from the feds june 25 decision to leave the benchmark rate at 2
6362282 dissents serve a purpose he said today they help communicate the sense of the committee they help communicate where the hard choices are where the uncertainty lies
6362283 interest rates are low i dont think there is any debate about that plosser said today at some time these rates are likely to go up challenge is determining when
6362284 president george w bush said wall street had got drunk and was experiencing a hangover at a recent closed door fundraiser in houston in which he also made light of the us housing crisis
6362285 in a video recording that emerged on tuesday mr bush questioned how long wall street banks would remain sober and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
6362286 the recording was obtained by an abc outlet in houston and filmed even after the president apparently asked for cameras to be turned off
6362287 when asked at a press conference last week whether the us banking system was in trouble mr bush said i think the system basically is sound i truly do and i understand theres a lot of nervousness but the economys growing
6362288 in the video obtained by abc mr bush had a tougher view of wall street
6362289 theres no question about it wall street got drunk thats one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
6362290 mr bush then shifts attention to the housing crisis pointing out to a laughing audience that the cities of houston and dallas had not been hit by the downturn in the housing market
6362291 and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because lauras over there trying to buy a house
6362292 by january home prices will be down another 10 or so and our japanese style property deflation will be in full stride congress will have had its summer recess though and spent september and october on the campaign trail they had to get re elected you know so those homeowners just had to wait
6362293 but youll have your tax bill and your healthcare bill and your housing fix and somehow itll all be paid for by wealthy hedge fund managers oil companies or pray tell a robust economy thats creating good jobs at home instead of exporting them abroad
6362294 not that you wont accomplish most of that the robust economy and the good jobs notwithstanding
6362295 while the republicans will blame you for years and label you trillion dollar obama in future campaigns there is in fact not much that you or any other president can do

6362300 us banks direct primary credit borrowing from the federal reserve rose to the highest level ever in the latest week reflecting the growing need of the banking sector to rely on the central bank for cheap funding analysts said
6362301 banks primary credit borrowings averaged 16 38 billion per day in the latest week a record high and up from 13 92 billion the previous week federal reserve data showed on thursday
6362302 on the day of july 23 banks primary credit borrowings rose to 17 68 billion the highest borrowing since september 12 2001 when banks borrowed 45 5 billion in a single day
6362303 us foreclosure filings more than doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier as falling home prices left borrowers owing more on mortgages than their properties were worth
6362304 one in every 171 households was foreclosed on received a default notice or was warned of a pending auction

6362306 john paulson who recorded what was thought to be the single biggest profit in the history of the hedge fund industry last year by betting on a financial collapse is planning a new fund to provide capital to cash strapped banks
6362307 mr paulsons new york based paulson amp co plans to open a new hedge fund by the end of the year to buy into financial institutions raising cash although the plans have not yet been finalised investors said they expected to see documentation for the new fund next month assuming it went ahead
6362308 the move suggests mr paulson is preparing to call the bottom of the market for financials a shift likely to be closely watched by other investors mr paulson was the flag carrier last year for a group of hedge funds that made enormous profits estimated by investors at more than 12 billion for paulsons funds by shorting or betting against subprime mortgages
6362309 is the fundamental background still deteriorating or is it now improving
6362310 crude oil has broken its medium term uptrend which is an improvement in terms of investor concerns but it needs to fall considerably further to reverse its shock effect on stock markets and gdp growth
6362311 western bank indices have bounced sharply after clear evidence of capitulation selling in the west which is a recent improvement but will need to demonstrate further evidence that the overall trend is reversing
6362312 central banks are still hawkish on inflation although there is some tentative evidence of a softening in this stance
6362313 the wall street leash effect had been very negative before providing some respite commencing last week although it hit a speed bump today as the rally reached initial resistance from the january and march lows
6362314 net it all out and we have some improvement however to revive animal spirits among bulls the technical rallies which commenced last week will have to be larger and more durable than what we saw following the january and march lows
6362315 if the decline in crude oil continues to play it should be bullish for stocks indeed just as in horseshoes and hand grenades all you have to be is close when attempting to catch a bottom in the stock market to make a lot of money if you adopt a scale in buying approach which is what we have attempted to do over the past few weeks as stated two weeks ago what a great time to be an investor for if you are a well prepared investor volatility breeds opportunity
6362316 the decline in domestic economic activity steadily climbing input costs and diminished support from currency translation is likely to result in a sharp downturn in eps in our view
6362317 the number of profit warnings from large cap european companies this year looks set to hit the highest level since 2003 warns gareth williams equity strategist at ing
6362318 he notes there were 25 warnings in the first half of 2008 the most for five years and that there have been a further five so far in the second half
6362319 since 1996 48 of profit warnings have come in the first half and 52 in the second half using the average to project forward suggests 52 profits warnings for the year as a whole in other words there might be another 22 to come
6362320 however mr williams warns that it is far more likely that the second half will see profit warnings coming through at a faster rate than in the first six months of the year
6362321 bottom up forecasts remain dangerously optimistic and our top down models suggest that euro strength high oil prices and consumer fragility will start to hit home in the coming quarters he says
6362322 mr williams says that unsurprisingly the banking retail and technology sectors have dominated the list of warnings so far this year
6362323 over the past two months the transportation retail property and media sectors have all fallen further than bank stocks
6362324 but more worrying is the slump in resources stocks which reflects the health of the global rather than the domestic economy
6362325 the mining sell off suggests the global growth story is over fears of a slowdown across the developed world are being realised but now the robustness of some developing economies is being questioned the rate of growth in china is slowing as last weeks second quarter numbers albeit still an impressive 10 showed uk investors may soon look back fondly to a time when they just had to worry about banks
6362326 stocks in china and india offer good bargains after benchmark indexes in the nations declined more than any other major market this year templeton asset managements mark mobius said
6362327 weve been rearranging the portfolio based on valuations which have come down pretty dramatically in places like india and china mobius who oversees about 47 billion of emerging market equities said in an interview from toronto thereve been big declines
6362328 mobius joins investor jim rogers in favoring chinese stocks after they plunged 46 this year
6362329 chinas csi 300 index is valued at 21 times reported earnings near the lowest in more than two years and down from a peak of 53 times in october 2007
6362330 rogers who said he hasnt sold any of the chinese equities he started buying 1999 told investors on june 28 not to give up on the nations stock markets
6362331 marc faber publisher of the gloom boom amp doom report disagrees the investor said on july 4 that investors betting on a rebound in chinas tumbling stocks are setting themselves up for more losses
6362332 mobius added that he favors shares in brazil and russia because the two markets can still benefit from the demand for energy and other raw materials
6362333 since its lows in late 2000 the euro has risen over 83 against the us dollar and 51 in trade weighted terms
6362334 another precondition would be a further setback or consolidation in crude prices given that the ecb is more sensitive to headline inflation than the fed
6362335 the chinese renminbi fell for the third consecutive day on monday sparking speculation that its continued appreciation might not be a foregone conclusion
6362336 the renminbi has risen more than 6 against the dollar this year as the chinese authorities have used the currency as a tool to dampen inflationary pressures in the countrys overheating economy
6362337 by midday in new york the renminbi dropped 0 2 to rmb6 8290 against the dollar after the peoples bank of china fixed the currencys daily mid point lower for a third successive day
6362338 gabriel stein of lombard street research said that while the move could just be put down to normal daily fluctuations the chinese ministry of commerce had called for a slower pace of renminbi appreciation
6362339 wen jiabao the chinese premier has talked about helping chinas exporters
6362340 it could be the beginning of a policy shift said mr stein
6362341 i have previously said that this years spike in crude oil prices had become by far the biggest global problem
6362342 today i feel increasingly confident that crude oil established an important medium term peak last week
6362343 meanwhile i think mark mobius is right to be interested in china and india at these levels and given the size of the funds that templeton manages he cannot really afford to hold out for historically low valuations
6362344 the main reservation most strategists have about china india or any other promising market today is inflation
6362345 to those who might ask would we not then see oil move back up and renew its uptrend my answer is not immediately lower demand for oil in the usa due to more efficient usage could easily offset rising demand in china for a while also it is only a matter of time before iraqs oil production increases dramatically
6362346 the arctic holds as much as 90 billion barrels of undiscovered oil and has as much undiscovered gas as all the reserves known to exist in russia us government scientists have said in the first governmental assessment of the regions resources
6362347 the report is likely to add impetus to the race among polar nations such as russia the us denmark norway and canada for control of the region
6362348 the us geological survey usgs believes the arctic holds 13 of the worlds undiscovered oil while 1 669 000 billion cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to 30 of the worlds undiscovered gas reserves
6362349 the extensive arctic continental shelves may constitute the geographically largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on earth the usgs said
6362350 the overlay chart of oil and gold shows that both commodities have been in impressive uptrends for much of the decade to date
6362351 the hong kong securities and futures commission approved the citys first gold exchange traded fund to meet investors demand after bullion prices climbed
6362352 hong kong wants to bolster its position as an asian financial center as rivals tokyo and singapore offer commodities trading gold for immediate delivery has jumped 39 in the past 12 months as investors seek an inflation hedge and alternative assets as global equities declined
6362353 gold related investment products are expected to be well received when inflation remains high as investors are seeking ways to preserve their wealth kenny tang associate director at tung tai securities said in hong kong
6362354 a gold exchange traded fund typically allows investors to trade the commodity without taking physical delivery of it each share in the fund represents a quantity of the commodity
6362355 the listing in hong kong comes after a similar fund started trading in japan this year and in singapore in 2006 hong kong is also planning to start a commodities exchange in the first quarter of 2009 and will offer dollar denominated fuel oil contracts for delivery into china
6362356 the slew of weak data from across the eurozone this morning all but guarantees that the european central bank ecb wont be making any more rate hikes in the second half of this year
6362357 today also saw the release of our favorite eurozone leading indicator the belgian national banks bnb business confidence indicator
6362358 hitherto we have seen plenty of negative data from spain the zones fourth largest economy thanks to its housing market slump ireland has also been weakening rapidly now the combination of high prices a strong currency and tight credit conditions is weighing on the likes of france and germany while one month of poor data does not a recession make the trend clearly is downward and that should be enough to stay the ecbs hand even if consumer price inflation has not yet peaked
6362359 todays ecb data on credit and money supply showed that the pace of loan growth to the private sector is easing coming in at 9 8 on the year in june versus 10 5 in may in addition the headline rate of growth in m3 money supply fell to an annual 9 5 in june from 10 0 the month before while the pace of credit and monetary expansion is still high for a slowing economy the fact that they are easing all but guarantees that the european central bank ecb wont be making any more rate hikes in the second half of this year
6362360 the ifo business climate index for industry and trade in germany has fallen again significantly in july following a clear worsening in the previous month
6362361 high street sales suffered a record slump last month stoking fears that a vicious downturn in consumer spending will tip britain into recession
6362362 the quantity of goods sold in shops across the country plummeted by 3 9 during june the biggest monthly drop since 1986 official retail figures showed
6362363 the data the first official confirmation that a severe downturn in consumer spending is taking hold sparked further worries of a headlong retreat from the high street undercutting the spending that has fuelled the economy for more than a decade
6362364 the relentless stream of negative economic news out of the uk has the headline writers dredging up the old specter of stagflation a stagnant economy with rising inflation
6362365 todays preliminary q2 gdp report from the uk showed real growth slowing to 0
6362366 japanese exports shrank for the first time in nearly five years in june as the growth in shipments to emerging markets that had underpinned demand failed to offset the global impact of the us economic slowdown
6362367 the 1 7 year on year decline in shipments in june was the first in 55 months and increases the likelihood that japan the worlds second largest economy contracted in the second quarter
6362368 the data was a blow to advocates of the so called decoupling theory who have argued that a surge in demand in emerging markets such as asia the middle east and russia would make up for any us slowdown
6362369 the decoupling scenario is almost collapsing said junko nishioka japan economist at rbs
6362370 chinese officials and government economists have warned domestic banks to tighten their mortgage lending criteria after the us governments action to prop up fannie mae and freddie mac the giant mortgage agencies
6362371 liu mingkang chinas top banking regulator has in recent days urged the countrys state owned commercial banks to beware of risks in the real estate sector and ordered them to tighten loan approval processes
6362372 others among chinas policy community have also begun to express concerns about the health of the countrys banks amid signs a once booming property sector has begun to slow
6362373 average house prices in chinas 70 largest cities were up 10
6362374 lending standards at chinese banks are often much looser than in developed countries in part because china is still in the early stages of building a credit rating system

6362467 the norwegian economy has been flourishing of late enjoying substantial real income growth with low inflation and very low unemployment benefiting from rising world energy prices and favourable supply shocks in the wake of globalisation this good performance also reflects fiscal restraint broadly successful monetary policy and the economys capacity to attract foreign labour macroeconomic policy is nevertheless facing a number of difficult challenges both in the short and medium terms the inflation targeting framework used by norges bank has worked well but faces a difficult period although financial market conditions had tightened the spring of 2008 saw core inflation rising close to the central banks inflation target while headline inflation was high and fluctuating the monetary stance may need to tighten further if demand pressure continues and cost inflation accelerates or import prices pick up but with downside risks from high household debt and the still uncertain resolution of the sub prime crisis and ensuing financial turmoil a cautious approach is required

6362483 we were called just after 3am to attend the house and when we arrived the police and ambulance were already there but there was no sign of activity
6362484 it took up our time getting to and from the fire which is always dangerous as it could take up valuable time needed to get to a genuine fire
6362485 we have no idea why the address was used by the caller the police are currently investigating
6362486 the person who made this deliberate malicious call is responsible for risking the lives of others
6362487 two reading fire engines and their crews in addition to the police and ambulance services were called to attend this non existent incident if there was a fire a traffic accident or other incident elsewhere people could have died thanks to the mindless actions of this individual
6362488 fire engines and firefighters are there to help save lives not to waste their time responding to hoaxes
6362489 all three emergency services were called to the road but when we arrived nothing was happening in the road
6362490 efforts are now being made to get the mobile phone that made the call disconnected
6362491 these calls obviously drain resources in our control rooms meaning genuine callers with a real emergency to report may struggle to get through people should stop and think before calling 999
6362492 unless it is a life or death emergency people are injured or the crime is in progress people should call the non emergency number 08458 505 505
6362493 the force is working to reduce the number of unnecessary calls and quite simply we now have the technology and systems in place to effectively deal with hoax or nuisance callers
6362494 the network providers assist us with terminating mobile phones used to block real emergency calls like crimes in progress injury road traffic collisions and other life and death situations
6362495 we are also working in close partnership with the other emergency services to identify those people who ring us because they have no one else to turn to
6362496 chris understood that his continuing presence in the office would be a distraction
6362497 i did not reach this decision lightly chris has been a loyal and effective city employee for many years he deserves the presumption of innocence unless and until the courts find otherwise
6362498 should chris be exonerated of all charges i would welcome him back as chief of staff and do whatever is necessary to see that he receives full back pay
6362499 with sadness i announce that i have requested a leave of absence from my duties as chief of staff for councilman jack kelly i have taken this action because it is in the councilmans best interest and the best interests of the citizens of philadelphia i have requested that my leave begin immediately and extend until after the trial of the charges against me
6362500 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics

6362508 i dont think this investigation would ever have started without christian marrone
6362509 prior to the federal governments involvement i think he provided information that found its way to the inquirer that produced a multitude of stories that i think got the attention of the federal authorities i do believe without christians involvement in providing that information it would never have gotten to where it is today
6362510 i dont see any purpose in talking about the trial or vince at this point
6362511 totally baseless and ridiculous its completely desperate and runs counter to the facts at hand facts are stubborn things and the truth will come out
6362512 and i want them to know while they may not have always come first because of my public service for the rest of my life they will always come first
6362513 but it was evident when marrone worked for us that he absolutely hated senator fumo he was constantly bashing the senator

6362526 when we organize ourselves as a region and we promote ourselves as a region were much more powerful
6362527 previous mayors have paid lip service to the notion of regionalism but its just never happened
6362528 the fact that mayor nutter made this an early priority and physically came out to the suburbs really spoke volumes
6362529 there are a lot of structural reasons for that animosity
6362530 the city and suburbs have competed for jobs residents for attention which often results in tensions
6362531 it was done in a way that tore at the fabric of regional cooperation
6362532 the county got bigfooted frankly by the arts world in the city and by the political leadership there in a way thats not particularly helpful
6362533 the fact that so many different organizations have to approve everything we work on that can be difficult because it can take a long time
6362534 what this usually requires is a central city mayor like richard daley in chicago to share the credit and work collaborative allow sometimes the suburban counterparts to take the lead on an initiative so that they have the buy in thats needed
6362535 when mayor daley goes to the caucus he goes in like any other mayor he sits in the back of the room and when he has a question he raises his hand i would expect to do the same thing
6362536 i just want to play an appropriate role in getting it started

6362543 i wasnt aware john mccains platform contained winged centaurs saving little girls from natural disasters
6362544 though come to think of it it might have been our governments policy for hurricane katrina
6362545 you know if i had a dream that one of my parents was a creature out of a ray harryhausen movie or an episode of xena warrior princess id want to keep that to myself
6362546 i sure as fuck wouldnt print it in a national newspaper
6362547 john mccain needs to call this woman up and tell her that he is not the narnia candidate
6362548 does that mean if mccain gives the childlike empress a new name he wins the election

6362554 its a medical clinic and an orphanage for children that have been involved and whose parents have been involved in the violence in afghanistan
6362555 for those that have been orphaned by a conflict thats lasted for god knows how many years im going out there im obviously not gonna be able to administer the entire project but i feel like its essential to be involved the aspect of media coverage is essential i joined with the human rights organisation omeid international to facilitate this i get lots of programmes shown to me i could choose to do this or choose to do that and this particular time around i wanted to do this the need came from the same place that all my music came from it aint like i decided to reach into another part of myself its just a natural progression its a little bit of weight on the shoulders but its something that i welcome because its something i know needs to be done
6362556 i wanted to wake up people in the states and let em know no matter what you think poverty is out here homie you cant even possibly begin to fathom what we facing out in the third world
6362557 i wanted to make it clear and present for them
6362558 but thats not very fair to say as i dont know how many people in london have the opportunity to go to a place like chechnya or bosnia
6362559 two people who are alcoholics one of them is a bum on the street and the other one drives a school bus full of school children the alcoholism of the bum on the street affects nobody in other words the ignorance of somebody who doesnt live in a place that controls things doesnt affect anybody but the ignorance the alcoholism of the man driving the school bus full of kids his drunken state an his inebriated recklessness affects many more peoples lives than his own in other words the people here who have control of the stuff their ignorance their lack of culture their lack of historical knowledge their lust for power that affects millions of people
6362560 i went to visit my relatives when i came back i was five six something like that it was strange because at that point i was able to begin to digest what i saw around me when youre a little kid you have flashing images and you can see and remember little things but i can clearly distinctly remember a completely different world than the one i was used to that i left behind in harlem the poverty level was a lot different the fact that there was a guerrilla struggle going on at the time definitely illuminated a lot of things for me and was incredibly powerful to see everywhere you went there were people with machine guns uzis blocking all public entrances searching people at random kind of like weve got here in the states now
6362561 you know if you wanna ride the train you got a motherfucking dude with a damn m16 gonna search through your bag
6362562 its gotten ridiculous when the sean bell thing happened i put out something called the police state chronicles im trying to get a thousand stories signed affidavits of police brutality so that i can finally put this out there and hopefully publish it so that other people can see so that they realise when this keeps happening these arent random incidents there is a pattern of violent abuse that happens on a regular basis cos to keep it really real nypd is the biggest gang in new york they dont fuck around yo if you fuck up one of the theyre gonna fuck up all of you if you screw with one of their family they definitely gonna come get you your car gets stolen they be like alright ill be there you ring them say my neighbours a cop and their cars been stolen copsll be there in like three and a half seconds
6362563 we spoke yeah but they were very non receptive to what i wanted to do and what i wanted to accomplish
6362564 we have to remember that hip hop had a side of it that was just about partying enjoying life and we shouldnt look down upon that cos at the same time every single time that people have been put in a terrible position of bondage they sang songs that didnt have anything to with their condition you know slaves sang songs on the plantation dont mean they enjoyed being there but thats how i look at this there are people who sings songs of joy and people who sing songs about things that theyre not experiencing and things they dont have because they wish they did have it they see that as success whereas i would argue theres different levels of success having chains cars having lots of women thats not success you know having chains cars having lots of women thats not success not as successful id say as having one woman that really loves you and cares physical property that makes you look good isnt as wealthy as being good as being in a righteous position in terms of owning property owning your own home owning a business which you also use for tax purposes so youre not just getting raped by government every year i think just because people run on that level doesnt necessarily take away from very single aspect of their manhood nahmean people try to talk about all those people like theyre all puppets the sad part is the industry has specifically targeted the other side of hip hop
6362565 i think even in the bible when we talk about judgement day apocalypse i think its miss translated
6362566 i know its miss translated its not the end of the world is the end of the age i think a certain age is gonna come to an end it doesnt necessarily mean the entire world as we know it is gonna come to an end but there are gonna be significant changes in terms of making preparations for that i think you know the fact that im buying land in south america that im making myself more self sustainable i think thats a whole part of it im not a prophet brother im not a fortune teller i dont know whats gonna happen i just know theres gonna be some significant change itll probably have a lot to do with the environment though
6362567 being able to support my family and spreading truth to the people
6362568 i could see something through the window of the back room
6362569 i went in and saw hed hanged himself using his dressing down cord i couldnt believe it
6362570 he looked like he had been crying which was unusual for him he was also a lot drunker than id usually seen him but i asked him if he was okay and he assured me he was fine
6362571 it was totally unexpected in the days before he seemed his happy normal self
6362572 he was a fun person to be around we spoke a lot but he never confided in me that anything was wrong
6362573 we never knew anything we didnt know he had seen a counsellor or that he had been taking depression tablets
6362574 he was doing really well in his studies and to us he was just his happy go lucky self
6362575 he said he was just a bit anxious about life
6362576 he said he wasnt sure where he fitted in but he was sorting himself out
6362577 i wasnt worried about him and when i went to see him at university he was fine
6362578 there was no evidence that he was suicidal or that this was going to happen because steven kept his anxious moments from people

6362582 i dont know why it had not been found earlier it may have been snagged it may have been underwater for a period of time and recent rains just brought it to the surface sgt rodgers said today
6362583 its a very sad ending unfortunately hes been missing for two weeks so it was an ending that was probably to be expected
6362584 it looked like a dummy but i touched his ear it felt soft and not hard like a dummy so i knew he told reporters today adding mr denson and he were upset by the find
6362585 its not very nice not when youve got kids of your own
6362586 i just hope that it was an accident and he fell in and no rats killed him
6362587 at least now hes been found they can do something about it and start living now they have got the boy back
6362588 theyre students obviously very upset were watching them mr campbell said
6362589 the worst has happened but in a way they were prepared for the worst
6362590 he was a lovely happy cheerful kid his english wasnt fantastic but he was going to the language school in melbourne
6362591 the attorney general robert mcclelland needs to look at some of the loose ends implicit in this case mr rubenstein said
6362592 its illegal to download pedophile material so i think theres some scope for creative legislation here al manar recruits terrorists and effectively advertises for donations
6362593 acma is analysing current broadcasts by al manar and will report to government on whether any of its broadcasts offend the counter terrorism standards senator conroy said
6362594 the government will await the report by acma before determining any further action he said
6362595 al manar is renowned for inciting violence and hatred the commission said in a statement
6362596 its a deal its a steal its the sale of the

6362598 if the business case of terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board incoming group managing director of public policy and communications david quilty said through a spokesman
6362599 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors

6362606 modest the bca suggests returning emissions to 2000 levels by 2020
6362607 as the government we have to be very conscious that any decision to shield one sector or increase the protection to one sector will inevitably place greater costs on other parts of the community and other parts of the economy senator wong said
6362608 the emissions trading scheme must do whats right for the climate and for all australians not whats good for a few big polluters seeking a golden handshake mr henry said
6362609 there appears to be a growing chorus of big carbon emitters calling for weak carbon targets and special treatment as part of the governments response to climate change he said

6362619 the first priority is that he must continue his journey to london said major general pongdej chaipravej immigration chief at suvarnabhumi airport
6362620 we will have to expel him either back to vietnam or britain or another country where he wants to go said colonel voravat amornvivat a spokesman for the immigration service

6362623 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6362624 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6362625 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6362626 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6362627 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

6362634 its hard to not be excited when you see their excitement and theyre so well behaved the first day because theyre not quite sure what teachers are like
6362635 his first day of big boy school is a lot of stress
6362636 for both of us hes a very active child so i dont know if he can hold it down in a classroom i hope they move around a lot
6362637 we had almost 90 percent of our kids at orientation
6362638 in the last day or so the market has begun to question the fundamentals of the recent us dollar recovery he said
6362639 we have seen particular focus on rumours and innuendo about us investment banking
6362640 i still stand by the view interest rate differentials are less us dollar supportive he said
6362641 despite the best efforts of police the trial powers were ineffective in assisting police to apprehend drug couriers on a sustained basis mr barbour said in a statement today
6362642 i have considerable reservations about whether these or similar powers will ever result in the cost effective detection of person involved in road based drug trafficking
6362643 overwhelmingly drug detection trial operations resulted in the detection of persons involved in minor possession offences rather than those involved in the supply or trafficking of indictable quantities of drugs mr barbour said
6362644 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6362645 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6362646 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6362647 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6362648 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6362649 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6362650 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6362651 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6362652 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6362653 officially im on my last year of my contract ive had preliminary talks and theres been interest from elsewhere
6362654 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6362655 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6362656 the result was soccers equivalent of a rebound relationship established for the wrong reasons and doomed not to work
6362657 sub in nasri here read gourcuff so it looks like im being innovative
6362658 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6362659 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6362660 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6362661 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6362662 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6362663 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6362664 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6362665 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6362666 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6362676 it is time for the government to scrap this outdated method nlgns proposal would make the most of the incredible amount of data already collected drive joined up services across government and save significant sums of money over the long term
6362677 i could see something through the window of the back room

6362680 it was totally unexpected in the days before he seemed his happy normal self
6362681 he was a fun person to be around we spoke a lot but he never confided in me that anything was wrong
6362682 we never knew anything we didnt know he had seen a counsellor or that he had been taking depression tablets
6362683 he was doing really well in his studies and to us he was just his happy go lucky self
6362684 he said he was just a bit anxious about life
6362685 he said he wasnt sure where he fitted in but he was sorting himself out
6362686 i wasnt worried about him and when i went to see him at university he was fine
6362687 there was no evidence that he was suicidal or that this was going to happen because steven kept his anxious moments from people
6362688 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6362689 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6362690 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008

6362692 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6362693 the government will do all it can to support the families in this difficult situation
6362694 the whole government logically is affected very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6362695 she said they could see the fire and then it was not even a minute or so they heard something blow up
6362696 they were about 200 meters 660 feet in the air and then they were landing but not crashing they were landing like little by little it was not like they fell down suddenly
6362697 the firing went on intermittently for 45 minutes from 6 40 am local time 0110 gmt
6362698 there was no loss of life or damage to property in the shelling
6362699 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6362700 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6362701 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6362702 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6362703 there is no shame in closing restaurants that arent working and producing improved results will have a more significant effect on the business and the brand
6362704 we are looking at opening larger sites from 90 to 120 seats at locations including the city and canary wharf
6362705 an old married couple except were not old were not married and were not a couple
6362706 it will be the toughest race ever as there will be many challenges that the contestants will not expect or be mentally prepared for the teams will have shorter resting time the journey will be harder and the speed of the race will be faster and more intense this combined with the new cast you can expect many dramatic moments tears twists and turns and an overall thrilling ride for viewers
6362707 its a fact that tisha is the most competitive girl i know
6362708 thats probably why we gel so well together we push each other to greater heights in whatever we do

6362716 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6362717 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6362718 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6362719 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6362720 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6362721 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6362722 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6362723 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6362724 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6362725 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6362726 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6362727 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6362728 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6362729 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6362730 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6362731 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6362732 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6362733 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6362734 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6362735 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6362736 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6362737 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6362738 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6362739 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6362740 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6362741 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6362742 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6362743 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6362744 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6362745 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6362746 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6362747 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6362748 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6362749 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6362750 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6362751 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6362752 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6362753 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6362754 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6362755 this is a planning took where all things are going
6362756 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6362757 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6362758 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6362759 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6362760 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6362761 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6362762 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6362763 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6362764 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6362765 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6362766 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6362767 i was horrified at the prospect of my daughters meeting a fate even worse than mine
6362768 people living tough lives beating the odds to become stars
6362769 strengthen with age so the wisdom of the old is far from being a myth
6362770 want to talk about big and important issues in a way that does justice to them
6362771 at the end of the day youve got to be judged on what you either do or dont do in the longer term

6362785 to look after this little whale i think as i was saying yesterday you need to suckle it for 11 months
6362786 that has never been done anywhere in the world before with a whale this size or for that long you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a two thousand kilometre trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales it doesnt know how to find krill

6362793 i just hung on him i saw him die and took my opportunity while i had it and kicked as hard as i could

6362803 ive never come close to the collaboration ive had with don hart
6362804 a lot of work done on this piece is conceptual conversations its a true collaboration
6362805 the common ground is in the dream and the vision all of us are interested in getting beyond boundaries don and i talk about writing emotional content and there are certain emotions that can only be called out of an orchestra
6362806 most of the time when people use an electric instrument with an orchestra they destroy the capability to blend
6362807 our approach is to handle it as any other solo orchestral instrument i play at the volume of say an oboe so don can orchestrate around the guitar

6362825 more and more often we lose sight of what were fighting for when were deployed the daily grind we go through day in and day out is extremely dangerous and arduous and its so easy to fall into a depressed state when youre thousands of miles from everyone you love
6362826 programs like this allow soldiers airmen marines sailors the chance to forget about the possibility of losing your life and those around you for a few minutes a day and those fleeting precious minutes are a welcome break from the rigors of war
6362827 we believe there are many americans regardless of how they feel about the politics of war who really want to let our troops all over the world know how much we appreciate them
6362828 at the same time there are soldiers far away from their families who long for a little taste of home

6362833 it is a fantastic experience when you see games like ours running with proper stereoscopic equipment
6362834 3d was meant to be seen in 3d and its great to see an organization like mtbs plant a flag firmly in the ground and state with determination that they want the real thing and you know what i think they will get it too the game creators are very pleased to have been awarded an mtbs certification for the implementation of s 3d technology in the latest update to dark basic professional we look forward to extending our native support for s 3d to our other brands including darkgdk and fps creator in the near future

6362836 to make this happen we used the popular iz3d s 3d drivers along with real d technology real d is the same technology used in modern movie theaters for successful films like beowulf 3d u23d and journey to the center of the earth 3d special thanks go to rob engle of sony imageworks siggraph tdvision corp iz3d and nvidia and real d for supplying the specialized equipment needed to make this possible

6362852 now investigators want to know what is stored in a portable computer memory device that noyes had in his chest pocket on the day of his arrest
6362853 es pr cticamente imposible para un jugador de p quer tener novia
6362854 me viene a la cabeza ese p quer tapado con descarte o descartes no recuerdo bien se que sal a en alg n episodio de
6362855 yo no creo que el p quer sea como un juego de esos que se juega en cualquier pueblo en el que se juntan en torno a una mesa durante horas varios grupos de aldeanos que compartiendo sanos improperios y tosca camarader a se apuestan un par de
6362856 no conozco ni quiero conocer lo que se juega ahora en ese p quer del que t me hablas pero para m es sin nimo de riesgo incontrolado de ambientes bizarros y de vidas en definitiva insatisfechas
6362857 en coherencia con lo que te he comentado antes saber que t te dedicas a esto y sobre todo por internet que me produce en su conjunto serias reservas sobre su real utilidad y su potencial peligrosidad me decepciona en gran medida siempre a salvo de conocer en profundidad los detalles del juego y esas implicaciones matem ticas y psicol gicas de las que tanto te empe as en hablarme
6362858 he visto que dispones de material audio visual que est s inmerso en una comunidad donde debat s cuestiones que ni me planteaba que tuviesen debate todo lo cual me abre una puerta a la esperanza
6362859 conozco el tipo de p quer al que juegas ya que conozco a un par de amigos que se dedican a ello y me dan cada dos por tres la paliza con los alicientes que tiene y lo sumamente atractivo y emocionante que resulta en cuanta conoces sus fundamentos con m s profundidad
6362860 adem s alguna vez he visto en canales de televisi n en horarios minoritarios retransmisiones de torneos de circuitos europeos y mundiales y la verdad es que si bien su ritmo no es trepidante ni engancha visualmente en exceso reconozco que debe ser un
6362861 de todas maneras me disuade bastante ese componente econ mico a pesar de que me comentas que precisamente es la correcta gesti n y juego dentro de banca la que da seriedad al p quer y separa a los buenos jugadores de los
6362862 pero sigo pensando que el azar juega un papel tan preponderante que se necesita ser de una pasta especial para llegar a ser ganador aunque t me aseguras hasta la saciedad que todo es habilidad y n meros no s si creerte
6362863 necesitar sentarme contigo m s tiempo delante del ordenador para que me sigas explicando todo lo que conlleva jugar a ese holdem que dices que frecuentas en esas salas que tienes descargadas en tu escritorio
6362864 lo cierto es que he compartido un par de horas de sesi n a tu lado mientras me ibas dando explicaciones pormenorizadas de cada acci n que efectuabas y tambi n he vivido te recuerdo unos minutos en los que has perdido el control de tu juego por culpa de un rival que supuestamente te estaba amargando en cada mano
6362865 ahora bien lo que no me puedes negar es que para dedicarte adentrarte en este mundo tuyo ya deb as tener dentro una semilla y yo s que a ti te viene de atr s que te conozco hace mucho y s que te brillan los ojos dentro de un casino s lo con ver jugar a otros y que todav a me acuerdo cuando me contabas con detalle tus avances en el mundo de las apuestas deportivas
6362866 de cualquier manera no te cambio andar trasteando con el e mule por abrir esas 12 mesas a la vez como me has ense ado adem s me parece imposible tomar decisiones con criterio con la pantalla repletita de mesas qu locura
6362867 todo lo que s sobre este juego lo conozco por ti por que has estado a punto de meterme el gusanillo sin xito a n y porque mi condici n de esposa me obligaba a estar un poco al tanto de un
6362868 lo cierto es que es fascinante como mero espectador curioso ver como un juego de cartas puede tener tantas implicaciones como puede exigir tanto an lisis y tanto estudio para poder hacerte un sitio lo cual me lleva a pensar que a ti te toca elevar esa dosis de an lisis y estudio hablando de todo un poco
6362869 he de reconocer que yo era de la opini n de que una persona con inquietudes intelectuales con una vida social amplia no era precisamente el candidato a dedicar horas y horas en internet a un juego de azar perdona ya s que te fastidia que lo catalogue as es por simplificar tontorr n como tampoco entiendo a esos chavales que se encierran a competir con otros en esos juegos de estrategia
6362870 ambas cosas las equiparaba y ambas me parec an actividades con un no s qu de enfermizo propio de personas introvertidas y poco dotadas para capacidades relacionales deportivas etc
6362871 ha sido precisamente el vivirlo en primera persona lo que ha modificado mi forma de entender este juego si bien todav a no me siento motivada para participar activamente en l
6362872 de tal manera he comprendido el intr ngulis de tu amada afici n que ya tengo confianza ciega en que no se transformar salvo hecatombe no te puedo vigilar constantemente en un vicio peligroso que se aleje del divertimento hasta el punto en que puedo apoyarte sin reservas cuando intentes hac rselo entender a tu padre

6362950 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6362951 i hope it leads to the position that suvs are acquiring in society where you look at anyone who hauls out a bottle of water and say what the hells wrong with you
6362952 to be able to see nobody and at that distance too why its as much as i can do to see real people by this light
6362953 the impression that hes more of a rock star than a person of serious public purpose
6362954 at this early stage we believe he had fallen from a block of flats
6362955 if there were a sentence forever i would certainly give it to you
6362956 at zte we provide carriers with handsets that have great features and design at an affordable price because we know that is what many consumers today are searching for
6362957 with the zte c79 we are giving consumers everything they are looking for on a single sleek device furthermore metropcs is the perfect partner to help us deliver this handset to the u s market
6362958 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6362959 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6362960 im obviously a bit biased but when guys are here for the film festival and they find out what right to play is all about they should see the turnout that well get
6362961 its their own opportunity to give back so its a lot of fun for them and its a lot of fun for the hollywood guys
6362962 obviously we would like to raise as much money as we could but were looking forward to getting out as many people as we can

6362965 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6362966 people are absolutely paranoid about it nobody gives a damn about that sort of thing in england but that siege mentality that whole bible belt thing that all puzzles me
6362967 to me being disliked by people i regard as intolerant i think thats a badge of pride the people who would find that offensive arent going to understand the movie anyway they tend to be anti intellectual
6362968 they wont understand that theyre anti intellectual theyre not intellectual enough
6362969 for whilst im very happy to be successful in the uk and i have a fairly loyal audience its also slightly constraining im sort of defined there are expectations about what im supposed to do and i dont have that in north america so ive got nothing to lose and directors consider me just this interesting new person and dont think anything odd about casting me in anything thats the nice upside to not being established here
6362970 there was also a slight kind of artistic snobbery insofar as my older brothers and i are not avid consumers of the mainstream the kind of bands we were into were always bands that werent in the charts if something charted it was immediately terrible
6362971 the worst pejorative term you could use about something was commercial so there was that sort of cultural elitism even though we didnt really know what we were talking about i remember refusing to go and see the film grease when i was 12 refused to go and see it because as i told my friends its just commercial crap and i was 12 and now of course i have a daughter so ive seen it a few times
6362972 its a perfectly nice film its just that we almost obsessively did not like to side with the majority view on anything the majority view on political or cultural issues should be treated with great skepticism
6362973 but they tend to be insecure when it comes to embracing anything thats loving or has any kind of heart they see that as a kind of weakness to be emotionally vulnerable in your comedy you have to be cerebral

6363005 i dont want the fans to get on him about my situation
6363006 he kind of just got thrown into this whole thing things dont need to be directed at him and i wanted that to be known
6363007 its hard to say it that way when you say my name fast
6363008 coach reid has enough trust in me and confidence like i said i didnt know where i was going to be once i got back with my teammates
6363009 once i got back with my teammates i was thinking if they put me second group or third group i would follow suit and work my way back up
6363010 i really didnt have a clue you can go out and practice and it can be one thing and they say hey youre not going to play you have to do your job
6363011 shawn is going to give it a go and well just see how he does
6363012 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play
6363013 i think another week of practice will definitely move me over the edge and ill be ready for the regular season
6363014 however i have been away from the guys and havent struggled with them or sweated with them i feel bad about that but i practiced this week and felt pretty good i think i am getting the trust from my teammates and offensive line back
6363015 he is going to take two or three steps forward and one back on occasion max is a fine player i think you win games with players like max
6363016 its funny i told him only my wife and mom call me lee tohhh its kind of hard to say my name the right way when youre saying it fast
6363017 i dont want fans to get on him for my situation
6363018 this is just one small token thats one less thing they have to worry about as far as school supplies it might not sound like a big thing but a lot of the kids cant go buy book bags and pads and pencils and stuff i want to try to eliminate at least that small part
6363019 shawn is going to give it a go and well just see how he feels
6363020 he just felt tight after the game and it was bothering him
6363021 we checked it out its one of those situations where if you can go you go if you cant then you have to have the surgery he tried it and he cant do that so weve moved on
6363022 a player can function or cant function and right now kevin cant function we know kevins a very tough guy and he was trying but he was just not able to get open out there
6363023 it feels like someone has stabbed you in the abdominal area its excruciating pain i dont know how you can play through it probably the smartest decision you can make is to fix it
6363024 he is coming off a heck of a season if his play drops he is not going to go to the media and say im hurt hes a stand up guy and will say im not doing the job the organization lets him get it fixed so he can be mentally back
6363025 after you get surgery you will feel 100 times better and youre going to feel you can work out and start routes be running and try to rehab but dont push it too soon
6363026 they were all going to play anyway so theyll play a little bit more now
6363027 i just hope to go out there and make a great impression
6363028 i dont see it as having to make up for anything
6363029 last year was last year this is a brand new year nobody has any yards anywhere we have to come out and do what we have to do our offense will continue to flourish were capable of getting better and making plays
6363030 other guys will have to step up for the time that curtis is out well be fine there
6363031 its their team theyre going to make decisions that they think are best and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
6363032 you may feel like ok i can go out here and sprint through my routes but thats definitely not the case youve still got some healing going on down there dont come back until youre definitely 100 percent because when you have surgery down there there are a lot of things that can go wrong
6363033 you never want to see one of your starters go out hopefully he wont be out for the whole season he can get back really quick we can hold down the fort until he gets back
6363034 i just go out there and work hard and compete and be at the highest level possible first game starting in the nfl im just hoping to go out there and make a great impression i know what im capable of doing and all the hard work ive put in the time has come and i just cant wait until friday
6363035 lets not let preseason deceive us any first he has a lot of hard work ahead of him he does show up though
6363036 i think hes going to be a pretty good player
6363037 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that hes going to be the next panthers star steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
6363038 you have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted in this league
6363039 hes made catches with the 1s and the 2s obviously hes getting open
6363040 there were plays where the ball was not thrown right and he was still open hes definitely learning the offense the guys hot you go with him thats just another weapon
6363041 im confident in jackson and his athletic ability and what he can do for this offense i cant say if its overwhelming or unrealistic or what not because im not desean i dont know how he feels about it im confident in him going out there and doing what he did in college just coming out and continuing what hes done in the preseason making plays and getting better each and every week

6363263 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters

6363265 im not saying every job is going to come back to martinsville just because im elected president im not saying that suddenly all the schools are going to be fixed

6363268 we have just gone through the first economic expansion in united states history this is before the downturn of the last several months where family incomes actually went down not up
6363269 john mccain lets face it hes got a compelling biography hes a p o w and so thats what people kind of think about instead of focusing on the fact that he wants to continue the same economic policies that george bush has been doing for the last eight years so my job in this election is to say i honor his service but i dont honor his policies and i dont honor his politics and we need a change
6363270 this campaign is in its 19th month and it continues to evolve
6363271 the scope of this pain and fear and insecurity is becoming greater and greater and is pushing him to communicate a greater sense of urgency
6363272 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6363273 senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight
6363274 not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether american wins or loses

6363324 kami keluar bersama dengan rekan rekan lain dan bukan berdua duan katanya menjelaskan keadaan yang sebenarnya
6363325 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000
6363326 that would probably be in the first half of next year as soon as we get our uk service going
6363327 when we start tapping into some of the growing markets especially central and eastern europe there will be a lot of interest to come down here as well
6363328 many malaysians send their children to universities in melbourne and with our notorious low fares families can now visit their children in melbourne more often and turn their trip into a holiday
6363329 australians also are avid travellers and what better way than to have low fares to get them to see the multicolour cultures of malaysia exciting shopping and sample local cuisines
6363330 theres probably growing concern at the faa at the regulators across the world of whether the economic downturn in the aviation industry may be having some effect on maintenance

6363340 as far as im concerned i thought we passed the ball well we frustrated limited chances created but you always get that away from home
6363341 the youngster getting sent off was a bit harsh and then we had to change our minds as far as the system was concerned overall i thought it was a great exercise and a blueprint of what im looking for away from home which is to pick a point up at least
6363342 i thought in the circumstances being a friendly i thought the first challenge was enthusiasm from the youngster and the second one was innocuous really its a friendly been hurt but the referees made a decision we can live with that
6363343 but i feel sorry for the boy because i thought he did extremely well and hell remember that for the rest of his life that he made his international debut against scotland did well and unfortunately got sent off
6363344 weve got to go into their slovakias backyard like we did to scotlands backyard tonight wednesday and if we do that we can get a good result but theres a lot of hard work to be done
6363345 what concerns us is how the state school system flat out violates the civil rights of minority children
6363346 we have an educational system in illinois that discriminates against minority children and those who should be held responsible for overseeing it have done nothing or very little about it
6363347 i was proud of how black people can move together in unison and are continuing to put pressure on the same point
6363348 the states failed school funding scheme has left many school districts particularly those who serve high concentration of low income and minority students with a mounting educational crisis
6363349 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6363350 the oxygen is piped and must pass through water because if you dont make it a little bit humid it becomes dry and it dries up the chest
6363351 pneumonia is actually the leading infectious cause of death in children contributing to about 20 percent of all under five mortality rates that translates to about 20 000 ugandan children dying of pneumonia per year
6363352 its a severe disease yet it has not been given the priority it deserves
6363353 pneumocystis carinii pneumonia pcp is the common cause of death in people with hiv aids but can be prevented with septrine
6363354 viral pneumonia is dangerous but the bacterial ones cause more deaths
6363355 and most of these are caused by two types of bacteria haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae and both of these bacteria have vaccines and beyond the vaccines are other important preventable methods for instance if children develop measles those children are more likely to get severe pneumonia so if we immunise all our children against only measles we reduce the amount of mortality in pneumonia by about 10 percent
6363356 and in addition to drug treatment a patient with pneumonia should stay in bed eat healthy meals and drink large amounts of liquids with good treatment it usually takes three days for patients to get better
6363357 we are working together with the ministry of health to prevent early neonatal death
6363358 our aim really is to make pneumonia visible do more advocacy and educate the communities but we are still limited by resources
6363359 ten years ago you could drive any two wheel drive sedan from there to where im standing
6363360 those were buried fairly deep just a few years ago but the ground has washed away
6363361 it seemed like overnight the impact was terrible we were hastening the demise of this arch exponentially
6363362 its like a lot of things a few bad apples ruin it for everyone
6363363 we were doing the damage in a restricted area to keep the damage from being done in a much wider area its not a perfect solution but its the best we could do the main goal was to protect the arch
6363364 one four wheeler can do more damage than a hundred horses or mountain bikes
6363365 the problem is they wont stay on the roads they rip up the forests
6363366 this is not a copy of a pc on tv
6363367 we are setting a new bar and delivering a richer internet experience to tv like never before
6363368 who shot jr beam me up scotty youre fired and good night and good luck you know these lines better than i do
6363369 i dont have to name the show or the stars why because we all want and we all love tv
6363370 in the past the idea was to put the browser on tv and use a text based interface which would interfere with the programme
6363371 this leaves the user in the environment they are comfortable with which is watching tv
6363372 companies still spend five times as much ad money on the tv as the web
6363373 advertising is sold more effectively on tv the problem with tv is that everyone sees the same ad
6363374 it puts tv not on an even footing with the internet as a mass medium but it could potentially leapfrog it because of the improved dynamic of the big screen audio experience
6363375 up until now there has been no consistent architecture to do this well
6363376 no de facto platform to fuse the internet with tv
6363377 for the first time we are bringing the full richness of the internet and web 2 0 and optimising the tv while respecting the tvs unique attributes simplicity easy of use socialising and entertainment value all the things that people love about tv
6363378 if you look at these things what they boil down to is is it compelling to use am i as a consumer going to sit on my couch with my very expensive tv and think wow i really want to go and look at the weather
6363379 as we have seen a lot of people are doing that with their laptop on their knee during the olympics or the superbowl which is inconvenient and involves just one person
6363380 so getting to the stage where you can bring some of that functionality to the tv without it being disruptive to the viewing experience is what has been missing to date

6363385 el comandante va al aire llama al aeropuerto declarando emergencia y vuelve a aterrizar porque con un s lo motor funcionando puede volar perfectamente
6363386 its like what the arctic monkeys said about their second album in the places when its dark its even darker and in the places when its light its even lighter the dark parts are with dumbledore and voldemort and his influence on things and the light parts are very very fun stuff with ron and hermione jesse cave who plays lavender is just brilliant we had a lot of fun
6363387 there are more people in therapy in this country than england so you get it
6363388 offended mothers were calling up and saying i shouldnt be doing this that they werent going to go see it ok dont see it theyre treating it like its pornography and its not its only seven minutes at the end of the play when im naked and im 19 now
6363389 were never in situations in films where we have to save each other or to stop each other from making public embarrassments of ourselves you know when an actor pauses whether its for dramatic effect or its a forgotten line you can see the panic behind the eyes
6363390 i asked him how do you memorize all those lines and he told me to just learn them in rehearsal so i did about a month before by the time opening night came i knew everyone elses lines too
6363391 le recours soutenu aux heures suppl mentaires au trimestre dernier est lun des facteurs doptimisme quant au dynamisme de nos entreprises
6363392 the challenge is to get it without losing control of the company
6363393 it demonstrates that people who have the means to pay will pay when the consequences are meaningful to them
6363394 if the funding cut is allowed to stand the child support enforcement program will lose ground
6363395 i think it has a pretty good shot of either passing as a bill or pieces of that bill ending up in other legislation
6363396 the individual complaints have to reach a critical mass before politicians take notice and thats what happened in illinois
6363397 were just happy to be doing so much better than we were
6363398 we have had a dry 24 hours but im afraid things just arent improving quickly enough
6363399 weve had nearly five inches of rain in august and that added to the six inches of rain we had in june and july so were saturated at the moment
6363400 the weather forecast looks a bit more promising for the weekend but we really need it to stay dry from now until monday for us to have a chance of staging racing on monday
6363401 were monitoring weather conditions closely and if we need to have a look at some point over the weekend we will certainly do so and we will keep everybody in the picture
6363402 it is a lovely morning and there hasnt been any rain on the track for around 15 hours but we couldnt race at the moment
6363403 ive had preliminary talks and theres been interest from elsewhere
6363404 its all about carefully picking where youll influence and allowing the message to seed itself
6363405 if you remember any of this call me one day
6363406 i have no words to describe it it is an unbelievable thing it is a very important step and undoubtedly the greatest of my career
6363407 were not just breaking through a mountain we are breaking through to the future
6363408 were potentially headed to one of the worst droughts weve ever had in california because of the conditions of storage the fact that were expecting very erratic weather patterns and we have much more demand than the last drought in 1993
6363409 what makes the building special is the double skin and layering of the glass
6363410 the outer skin will have diagonal dimensions to create a series of small pyramids contributing to the jewel concept
6363411 we have got just less than two weeks but i am hopeful we can sign some players we are still actively trying to get some people in
6363412 i have the support from the chairman randy lerner who has shown his intentions and done exactly what he said he would in supporting the team
6363413 we might get another three players in and we might be stricken with the same situation as west ham this time last year

6363424 he gave it the penalty away no im only kidding
6363425 it was a great save and there is a great rivalry and its a friendly rivalry and we train together
6363426 his performances have been consistently very high and it is up to me to make sure that mine remains the same to hang onto the jersey
6363427 thats great for him thats his second cap and to come on and produce a save like that is good for him and to show he can do it at this level as well
6363428 its good for him and also good to push me on as well

6363430 the seamless shift gearbox will really be our last development for 2008 and we will now shift our focus to 2009 in the second part of the year
6363431 really what force india has proved is that we look competitive in race conditions and under the right circumstances can pick up points if the chances come our way
6363432 weve performed well on street courses too and with two in the final part this could be a good opportunity for us
6363433 we need to look for a 100 percent reliability rate to ensure that whenever these chances come our way we are really able to take advantage
6363434 although 2009 is a big opportunity there are still points up for grabs this year
6363435 that said work for 2009 will step up immensely towards the end of the season so we can make sure we are ready
6363436 our simulations typically show a benefit of two to three tenths over one lap and possibly more as the driver has the option to get on the power earlier as the car isnt upset by the gear change

6363461 we have seen a rapid increase in the number of people being served with eviction and repossession notices
6363462 we are seeing about 10 cases a week normally we might see two a week but it was in january and february of this year that the number of cases started to ramp up
6363463 its a very difficult situation people are going without food in order to pay bills and are using credit cards to pay their mortgage its worrying as this is not sustainable
6363464 a lot of the repossessions are because banks are becoming tougher people have had discounted or low fixed rate mortgages which may have been at three per cent and are now at seven per cent and they cant close that gap
6363465 a lot of the time they have left it to go on so long that its too late for us to intervene
6363466 we are seeing people with higher amounts of debt if they have mortgages then debts can be anything up to 150 000 and where people have credit cards the average debt is 8 000
6363467 i dont think we have reached the peak yet there are more difficult times ahead
6363468 there is always an increase in the number of people coming to the food bank
6363469 some families are facing tough choices which may be as simple as whether to have heating or to eat

6363476 weve performed well on street courses too and with two in the final part this could be a good opportunity for us
6363477 we need to look for a 100 percent reliability rate to ensure that whenever these chances come our way we are really able to take advantage
6363478 although 2009 is a big opportunity there are still points up for grabs this year
6363479 that said work for 2009 will step up immensely towards the end of the season so we can make sure we are ready
6363480 our simulations typically show a benefit of two to three tenths over one lap and possibly more as the driver has the option to get on the power earlier as the car isnt upset by the gear change
6363481 we have had a dry 24 hours but im afraid things just arent improving quickly enough
6363482 weve had nearly five inches of rain in august and that added to the six inches of rain we had in june and july so were saturated at the moment
6363483 the weather forecast looks a bit more promising for the weekend but we really need it to stay dry from now until monday for us to have a chance of staging racing on monday
6363484 were monitoring weather conditions closely and if we need to have a look at some point over the weekend we will certainly do so and we will keep everybody in the picture
6363485 it is a lovely morning and there hasnt been any rain on the track for around 15 hours but we couldnt race at the moment

6363490 uns war aufgefallen dass sich viele websites auf bereits erlebtes konzentrieren da wird nach alten schulfreunden gesucht oder die bisherige karriere fein s uberlich aufgelistet eine community um sich ber seine zukunft seine vorhaben seine tr ume auszutauschen haben wir dagegen nicht entdeckt
6363491 i have no words to describe it it is an unbelievable thing it is a very important step and undoubtedly the greatest of my career
6363492 man muss die zielgruppe kennen um die richtigen produkte ausw hlen zu k nnen
6363493 die aktuelle finanzierung dient vor allem dem ausbau des europ ischen und nordamerikanischen marktes und dem aufbau neuer m rkte insbesondere in asien dar ber hinaus investieren wir auch in die weiterentwicklung unserer technologie und produkte
6363494 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
6363495 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
6363496 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees
6363497 geplant haben wir den deutschen start ja schon einige zeit aber irgendwie kam immer ein anderes projekt dazwischen
6363498 die business angels szene in deutschland ist noch deutlich unterentwickelt
6363499 we played very well in the first half but the czechs were dangerous and i have learned that when other teams counter attack well we have problems
6363500 were just starting the season and the players physical condition is not at its best but im sure theyll be better for the next game i think weve taken another step forward and im sure it will be right for the next game
6363501 weve got players who do fantastic in european club competitions but in internationals we dont click its something weve looked at
6363502 but i dont think we should be worried we have to stand up and be counted raise our game match teams with the commitment they show and hopefully our quality can overcome them were a great side everyone wants to beat us
6363503 it was a tough game against a good side but were disappointed we didnt win weve got to take it step by step weve a new manager with new ideas weve got to try things
6363504 were going to go home disappointed because weve not won at wembley when we should have won im a fan first and foremost and i want england to do well and all we can do is to try and take away the positives
6363505 wed like to tell the fans that we take full responsibility and its on us to get to the world cup and thats the be all and end all for the next 18 months
6363506 its up to us to try to take our club form into england games and believe me were working hard at that
6363507 were coming together working hard and talking about it amongst ourselves and we will get there im sure of that
6363508 the whole squad was bitterly disappointed to have followed up such a great result away to aberdeen with such a poor performance on saturday
6363509 it wasnt acceptable and that where we have to become more consistent as a team its still early days but come saturday well be determined to get back to the way we played against aberdeen
6363510 i dont know if i will start on saturday given the way things went against hamilton
6363511 i dont think any of the boys can say they have the right to a start after the weekends performance
6363512 thats when what we all do on monday to friday comes into play its up to each and every one of us to show the manager that we have put that behind us
6363513 well all be looking to be sharp in training throughout the week and hopeful make the starting 11 on saturday
6363514 you do what you can to make pre season games as competitive as premier league matches but it can be hard adjusting to the pace again
6363515 i was disappointed personally with my performance on saturday as well as collectively how we played as a team
6363516 john was a close friend of mine at ross county and at caley thistle i was delighted to see that he was back in their team on saturday when they got their first victory of the season
6363517 ive found them everywhere from benula road and telford road to the riverside and godsmans brae and the raining stairs
6363518 i could take you to eight or nine sites where people are injecting in inverness
6363519 they are even injecting in the grounds of inverness castle and thats where our sheriff court sits
6363520 at the moment i am pressing bt to remove three telephone kiosks from outside the main post office in queensgate because they are being used by addicts
6363521 i do wear protective gloves and am very careful when i do these clean ups but i would certainly not recommend members of the public to become involved in this activity
6363522 i think some councillors and some of the agencies are adopting an ostrich style approach and burying their heads in the sand
6363523 i have been speaking to representatives of the terence higgins trust tht a charity which provides a needle return service and sexual health advice for users and they agree the containers would be a good idea
6363524 i know there is some resistance to this in some communities but something needs to be done
6363525 we can respond to call outs during the day within 20 minutes but i would stress no member of the public should be attempting to remove these needles
6363526 the needle disposal containers have been tried elsewhere but it does not work because users fear they are being watched people will also be wary of using playparks if they see these needle bins
6363527 we dont have an epidemic of needles being left in the streets and parks of inverness but we would urge the public if they see a needle to contact 01463 715 087 during daytime hours and 0748745968 out of hours if they find a needle alternatively they can contact the police who will get in touch with the council
6363528 we would agree that these containers for users to dispose of needles would be useful our needle return service has an 80 per cent return rate which ensures they are not being discarded in public places
6363529 this is a service not just to the users but to the community in general there is a very negative image about drug users but many of them are very responsible and ensure their needles are disposed of safely
6363530 it was a holistic approach and has been so successful 60 per cent of the people who used the service are off drugs
6363531 its difficult to say if the problem is under estimated because after all it is an estimate
6363532 but it is a problem for the whole of scotland and the numbers are not as high here in the highlands as elsewhere however it is a problem and we still have to deal with it
6363533 what little time i have left will be spent living as a beast a shadow of the inside of the old age

6363537 the owner says that is a 1 5 million investment he has lost because of this accident well that tuatua and toheroa is sustenance for our people and if we lose that i think it is a bit more significant than a shipping boat

6363540 we have got just less than two weeks but i am hopeful we can sign some players we are still actively trying to get some people in
6363541 i have the support from the chairman randy lerner who has shown his intentions and done exactly what he said he would in supporting the team
6363542 we might get another three players in and we might be stricken with the same situation as west ham this time last year
6363543 the seamless shift gearbox will really be our last development for 2008 and we will now shift our focus to 2009 in the second part of the year
6363544 really what force india has proved is that we look competitive in race conditions and under the right circumstances can pick up points if the chances come our way

6363557 theres probably growing concern at the faa at the regulators across the world of whether the economic downturn in the aviation industry may be having some effect on maintenance
6363558 weve been in dispute with the airline over the difference between 3 per annum and 5 per annum
6363559 what weve done is come to an outcome where the airline has kept intact the headline 3 wage rise but theres been some changes to our wage classifications structure that sees all of our members get a minimum of 4 increase in remuneration per annum up to 5 8 per annum
6363560 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6363561 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6363562 and teams are possibly going to look to do that at hampden
6363563 its up to us to try and break them down i think it was a good exercise and it shows us that there is still a bit of work to be done in that aspect
6363564 the main games are coming up now and they are going to be difficult and they might be similar to tonight and we have to perform
6363565 he gave it the penalty away no im only kidding
6363566 it was a great save and there is a great rivalry and its a friendly rivalry and we train together
6363567 his performances have been consistently very high and it is up to me to make sure that mine remains the same to hang onto the jersey
6363568 thats great for him thats his second cap and to come on and produce a save like that is good for him and to show he can do it at this level as well
6363569 its good for him and also good to push me on as well
6363570 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6363571 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate

6363595 are they going to kick us out as well i dont want to go and live in the states again were going to stay here where we belong this is all your fault
6363596 you need to get help i received all those things at san jose
6363597 we dont need to go to the states any more we can do it right here were doing that as we speak
6363598 weve been running ever since we came here many years ago now the whole world wanna know how we running so they say there must be something in the air down there in jamaica that make jamaicans run like the wind
6363599 what i like about it is its got a hidden agenda it looks as if its about listening and joining with allies except the idea here which mccain cant say but i can is to essentially kill the un nobodys going to walk out of the un theres a lot of emotional attachment to it in the us how do you kill it you create a parallel institution
6363600 i just blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6363601 this week we have had a hurricane which has done tremendous damage in jamaica but when i rang to check how my family were they told me that no one was talking about the hurricane everybody was talking about the olympics
6363602 when i was watching the replay i was looking at myself and going that guys fast
6363603 the 200m has been my love ever since i was 15 and i was the youngest to win the world junior title
6363604 a lot of people compare me to michael johnson but i dont compare myself to a lot of other people because im trying to be just me michael is a great athlete and he revolutionised the sport i just changed it a little bit
6363605 all our athletes have undergone extensive testing more than enough if we had been cheating we would have been caught by now its a pity the testing has to happen but it validates all the results we have had for years we have wondered how we would do with a level playing field and now we know
6363606 some people are surprised by my day job whenever they see my paintings but i really enjoy my work as a bus fitters helper and an artist
6363607 i find painting extremely relaxing and rewarding especially when i see the pleasure that my pieces bring to audiences
6363608 even my colleagues in the metro depot ask to take my sketches home i am extremely pleased that i can help raise awareness of the work of autism ni and contribute to supporting this worthwhile charity
6363609 its wonderful that joes paintings are benefiting autism ni we are very grateful to him and of course to translink for supporting the event
6363610 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6363611 you would be surprised how many people come just to watch the greased pig contest
6363612 weve had several adults say hey we would like to do this
6363613 its kind of like the last thing before the kids go back to school
6363614 you hear a lot of good things back from people
6363615 they approve us doing it its something you can do for family thats not expensive
6363616 there is virtually no competition between the london airports and the two in edinburgh and glasgow whereas under separate ownership new operators would make the most of the opportunities and generally behave as companies do in a free market
6363617 here we are today with shortage of capacity and the earliest date by which we could build a new runway at stansted is 2015 and at heathrow is 2020
6363618 baa has not been particularly adventurous and has tended to plan its investments on a sequential basis there is also very considerable criticism of the lack of responsiveness by baa to airlines needs
6363619 the new terminal at heathrow took 22 years not because baa was slow but because the planning officials did not have a government policy against which to compare the project
6363620 my fear is that by changing the policy progress will perversely be slowed down
6363621 we need root and branch regulatory reform of the airport monopolies and i am not confident that the dft review will meet those requirements
6363622 the strength of emotion amongst travellers about improvement in airports is considerable
6363623 ultimately the whole aim of competition is to introduce better service at lower price which is the opposite of what monopolies provide but it is a long process
6363624 there wont be an immediate result or any noticeable effect in the near term
6363625 when was the last time you were in the end zone
6363626 my aunt was making what we now call our original bbq sauce when i was still in diapers
6363627 she was born and raised in philadelphia during the great depression along with her brother and two sisters my mother would make me baked barbecued chicken with this awesome sauce probably not as often as i would have liked but when we had it man what a treat
6363628 nothing fancy just regular pots and pans and for the most part me doing the stirring with a bit of help from my mother and father and girlfriend
6363629 ive always liked to cook but i dont have any cooking background
6363630 the whole thing started out with family and friends seven maybe eight years ago
6363631 people liked my aunts sauce so much theyd say you should try to do something with this the thought came and went til honestly id be sitting on that forklift thinking pretty much non stop about how id like to try to give it a shot
6363632 working in the warehouse doing the same thing over and over i thought this isnt the best thing as far as im concerned working for someone else when i might be able to really do something with this eventually i just got to the point that i decided to leave so i could focus on the sauce full time and see how far i could take it
6363633 i havent really started to keep track of that yet
6363634 its all been pretty gradual the epiphany of our lord parish christmas show over in plymouth meeting thats been a big one for me now im trying to spread out and find some more shows i can get involved with right now i have one coming up in maryland and one in york and im hoping to sell to local restaurants too maybe even get into some supermarkets down the road
6363635 the cranberry for example i always liked the taste of cranberry mixed in when i was younger so that goes back to then
6363636 the thing i think is different about all of the aunt caroline sauces theyre not smoky like most barbecue sauce and in my opinion theyre much sweeter than anything else out there sweet but with that little tang i love it on just about anything but chickens still my favorite or pulled pork
6363637 she had one son but he died years ago hopefully shes up there watching me and smiling
6363638 a chronic disorder that causes inflammation of the digestive or gastrointestinal tract
6363639 down the road a bit i want to donate portions of my profits to crohns research in the hopes of finding a cure
6363640 i cant do this right now because there is a very fine line between my cost and profit this is one of the biggest reasons for me getting this business rolling i think it might be a good idea to let people know and maybe make them aware of the illness but i want people to buy the sauce for the taste not for the charity
6363641 tattoo artists are like the rock stars of the art world everyone knows them and everyone wants to hang out with them they wake up late every day and they go to bed late
6363642 its hard to really get tattooed on the road you drive all day and you play all night getting tattooed is emotionally draining
6363643 sing this to yourself and other suggestions for a personal apocalypse
6363644 what im saying is that were in the same boat and the boat is not actually sinking
6363645 many people think its a problem going through those things and i dont think so
6363646 the music industry has been killing real music for a long time and its been getting worse and worse
6363647 it becomes the job of the artist to figure out new ways to get real music out there
6363648 they were about 30 cents cones were 5 and 10 cents
6363649 i grew up in that store but my father had to sell it during the depression we lost everything
6363650 it is a student funded facility so we are interested to hear the comments and feedback from the students and certainly try to listen to their needs
6363651 i think with our expansion of pharmacy services expanding our x ray offerings and the travel clinic hopefully were really striving to meet student needs
6363652 one can hardly hail from two more historically losing causes than the south and judaism both my cultures have long tragic pasts and not one jot of it has been forgotten
6363653 the story of southern jews is the story of sons not wanting to work in their fathers businesses
6363654 the last year of major reliance on the wa production base
6363655 we are developing two of the most attractive projects in the industry at a time when demand is strong and likely to remain so when serious medium term supply disruptions have become evident in africa and when funding pressures are extreme for many current producers and potential new entrants
6363656 iluka is ideally placed to supply much of the robust demand growth in the developing economies of the region
6363657 hey duke tas vu ces glandus nous matter comme des oies et faire coin coin comme des cons
6363658 i was talking to him this morning and it is just another bout for him just another tournament so thats the way weve been looking at it too taking it very low key
6363659 weve decided that we just want to watch it on our own
6363660 weve got a med al weve got a med al
6363661 i was watching it on and off throwing my head around the corner
6363662 i heard them all screaming inside so i had a fairly good idea of what was going on but it didnt matter i knew he was going to give his all and im so proud of him anyway
6363663 but he told me last night that he was going to win the gold
6363664 he has been training twice a day but he has done well in his exams too
6363665 i dont know how he is managing it but when he is focused on college it is 100pc and when he is focused on boxing it is 100pc
6363666 im going to give him the ticket and tell him to go down to the bookies and pick up his winnings
6363667 i never bet but i put 150 down on him when i read all about how tough his opponent was going to be i knew darren had a strategy
6363668 to be able to copy the look and style of both authors signatures
6363669 can i ask you a question why are all your women characters so crap
6363670 why should i wait in this long line to get my books signed by that dickwad
6363671 yes danida stopped funding the district after receiving information that there was corruption and lack of transparency during procurement and tendering of roads and up to now we are stuck with heavy debts
6363672 we have written to the igg to help us implement some of these recommendations and i am here danish embassy to present another request to help bail out the district from debts incurred during the implementation of their programme
6363673 you have to really say hats off to the high performance unit five qualifiers five into the second round three medallists
6363674 now were just going to see what colour we can get
6363675 ive had to try to hold back the tears all week
6363676 the dream is to get to the olympic games and to be locked out of the team when we get here you know its been really hard so just to keep your head together and stay focused for the team keep supporting the team and not make this about me
6363677 thats what i really wanted to do not make it about me not make it personal but just as a professional the work that ive put into the team i really wanted to lead the team in the olympic games and not to be at their side is really wrong
6363678 its really wrong and its been hard to deal with
6363679 whats been really encouraging for me is how my team have responded
6363680 how my staff have responded and how theyve kept me in the loop theyve been phenomenal i really do appreciate and respect that
6363681 because its been hard sitting up in the audience shouting when you know your boxer cant hear you its been very very difficult
6363682 the victories are there you know ive answered my critics the programme has answered all its critics
6363683 irish boxing could go on to do really special things but its got to believe in its own people it cant keep kicking its own people in the arse all the time
6363684 we can produce world class people in ireland whether its in boxing athletics or rowing we can do it but weve got to start believing in our own people
6363685 devil may care is a period book which is set in the 1960s and it really wouldnt fit as one of the films that eon has been making recently
6363686 i would have thought that if you could move casino royale from the 1950s you could move devil may care from the sixties but eon know what they are doing
6363687 a songwriter who set the beat for a decade a dancer with the fanciest feet on the street a singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and colour too
6363688 the girls have performed very well at both a2 and as we are a specialised school for drama but the students have really surpassed themselves in all subjects
6363689 our congratulations are with all the girls and we wish them well with their future careers
6363690 they were really hard and would have been much harder if we hadnt had the great support at school
6363691 there is a great atmosphere at school and everyone encourages each other
6363692 the girls have done really well and the school is really pleased with all the results
6363693 there are a tremendous amount of girls are achieving top grades and we have one girl who will be starting at oxford in september
6363694 i dont believe that it is necessarily that exams are getting easier i think pupils are working a lot harder
6363695 there are also a lot more resources available to students that they can use to their advantage
6363696 i nearly collapsed its a real career high its wonderful to have my picture used so well and being so well received its like winning an oscar the amount of congratulations i got
6363697 it was during my teens that my passion for photography began i can remember thinking back then that it would be great to have a photo of mine on a cover of a magazine like that so you could say this has been a realization of that dream
6363698 il y a un autre tat desprit par rapport lann e derni re on le sent
6363699 my goal was to continue to work and not let them tell me
6363700 i can imagine chris would be pretty happy to see them finished and would probably make a wry comment
6363701 during quilters meeting we talk about the art but also chat and solve the worlds problems
6363702 um fil sofo um homem que experimenta v ouve suspeita espera e sonha constantemente coisas extraordin rias que atingido pelos pr prios pensamentos como se eles viessem de fora de cima e de baixo como por uma esp cie de acontecimentos e de fa scas de que s ele pode ser alvo que talvez ele pr prio uma trovoada prenhe de rel mpagos novos um homem fatal em torno do qual sempre ribomba e rola e rebenta e se passam coisas inquietantes
6363703 but the skills that ive got i should beat him every day right
6363704 its 4 1 but two of those have been in ireland
6363705 i think it was 10 9 in a four nations semi final and 23 20 in the european union semi final in dublin
6363706 but i gave away 14 points too didnt want to do that in this one
6363707 so the tactics were perfect tie in the fella close him down and he played straight into my hands soon as the bell went he came straight at me it was perfect because im pretty strong in the zone
6363708 if anyone steps in and trades with me theres probably only going to be one winner
6363709 last time he fought degale he boxed him and degale was expecting a fight but darren boxed him hes well capable of doing both
6363710 i had no life so i started to question what i was doing because all my eggs were in one basket
6363711 i was in with secondary school children some who hadnt even done transition year so they were only fifteen and i had to wear the uniform ive only one picture that my mom took and i wouldnt let her take it anywhere
6363712 after being in hospital and not thinking that i would see properly again this is childs play
6363713 and he was the perfect guy my supposed nemesis but i didnt fear him
6363714 because it was redemption the world championship was a low point for me and probably for irish boxing at the time we underperformed and everyone was writing us off writing off the high performance
6363715 youve got to look at yourself and im disgusted with myself but im also frustrated that people would rather look at your faults instead of helping you out
6363716 stuck in the seventies and eighties and havent looked beyond because theyre trying to make themselves legends
6363717 there was no tariku bekele then he would have been a legend back then and they dont even consider him here and thats what people need to look at
6363718 but honestly i dont know how hed do in world cross country now
6363719 he was a great athlete of his time he was a proven champion but why dont we use that brain to help us instead of people saying well john treacy wonders can you match the performance obviously we cant its a new era
6363720 i dont know im too far out of the loop to know but theres just too many loops to go through
6363721 athletics ireland are trying and part of it is my own fault
6363722 this tool is a critical first step in helping hospitals evaluate their disaster plans to find out what works and what doesnt
6363723 that knowledge can help hospitals make important changes to their response plans now before a disaster strikes
6363724 it wouldnt just be about women replacing men but listeners replacing primates
6363725 i think women are more inclined to explore issues instead of just try to win arguments
6363726 we are lacking community consultation and there are studies that prove women are better communicators they actually talk to people and are good listeners
6363727 women also make up around 51 per cent of the population so we need to represent them
6363728 im not going into this election with a pink and fluffy feeling just because im a woman i actually feel i have something to offer the community
6363729 for young people in particular if they see someone doing something they will start to think i can do this too
6363730 at a previous job the men used sporting analogies to explain things and you did feel a bit silly if you asked them to explain it
6363731 its also an issue of increasing diversity on council not just in the gender of candidates but also in their background and skills
6363732 i was last years invitational coach in the series against the dutch along the east coast of australia and ive been mentoring a few of the younger guys
6363733 i had been asked to probably take that kookaburras job but realistically i have a very successful business in sydney and melbourne and ive got two gorgeous girls in lennox head who play for ballina
6363734 a major factor in my decision is that you have to be away for five months of the year overseas and i dont want to be away from my daughters for that length of time
6363735 i firmly believe the team can win the gold medal and personally i believe it will be the dutch and the australians in the final
6363736 the police were doing investigations and looking at the cctv this morning
6363737 evidently a guy jumped her when she went outside the door and dragged her in and abused her and was being threatening
6363738 he was threatening her with a stake a sharp piece of wood i believe and he had a screwdriver to try and get into the cash register
6363739 at one stage he had her by the throat and was making a lot of obscene comments to her and threatening her family
6363740 he tried to get money out of the register and couldnt find anything and took some grog and food
6363741 he then made the woman drive him to pacific vista drive he jumped out and ran down a beach track through the bush with his stash
6363742 then she drove to her sons house who lives in town he called me and then he drove her to the police station she wasnt injured
6363743 its alleged that the man stole a number of items from the premises before forcing the woman to assist him with loading the items into her four wheel drive
6363744 the man allegedly drove the woman to a remote location in byron bay and forced her to help him unload the items the woman was then allowed to drive from the scene
6363745 they smashed the window at the front to get out when they could have walked out the door
6363746 its quite possible it could be where our house site is
6363747 rous has resolved to proceed with the dam and resolved to build it when it is required
6363748 we have just begun the process of justifying the dam unless we can convince the state government and take the community with us then we wont build the dam
6363749 it would only take 15 kilometres of pipe from ocean shores to pottsville to join the tweed system
6363750 we could share water between the systems and the state government is looking at the possibility it could be a sensible mid to long term option to join the systems
6363751 its going to be a really close battle but i would have to see the cork team first before making a call on this one will graham canty play what about nicholas murphy they are the big questions
6363752 this will be a very interesting game i think that cork will be hugely motivated for this one they will be looking to finally defeat kerry in croke park after a few heavy defeats over the last few years
6363753 they will be up for this game and i think that kerry will be very aware of that and the threat that comes with it
6363754 of course those two games will bring kerry on but cork will be after their game against kildare so that will stand to them as well
6363755 cork were very good for 20 minutes against kil dare before they started to ease up
6363756 there has always been a great rivalry between kerry and cork and that will be the same again on sunday thats one aspect that never changes when kerry meet cork
6363757 kerry footballers like croke park its a field its a fast pitch a big pitch that sees plenty of one on one duels and there is plenty of space to be exploited kerry footballers have always done well up there
6363758 and i suppose kerrys record against cork in croke park in recent years will also be brought up a lot but i dont think it will have any bearing on the game
6363759 cork are a highly motivated team and it has all the makings of a very close match
6363760 there is no certainties in sport and thats the beauty of it all its unpredictable at best and thats the way we like it
6363761 to put an immediate stop to the fighting between their respective combatants to order them back to their barracks and headquarters to release captives and hostages and to arrive at an immediate ceasefire agreement
6363762 we also appeal most earnestly and urgently to the philippine national police their cafgus and cvus as well as to the local milf security forces to restore order in the affected areas in north cotabato and lanao del norte including the contiguous cities of kidapawan and iligan respectively
6363763 we call on local national and international aid agencies to provide immediate assistance to the displaced residents and their damaged houses chapels and properties with special attention to the poor the sick the babies and the little children
6363764 earnest and urgent appeal be heard accepted and answered throughout the region
6363765 we likewise strongly and urgently appeal to print and broadcast media to take utmost care in reporting only the facts and to avoid spreading disinformation incendiary comments and unconfirmed rumors
6363766 to ask god for an enlightened use of our reason for calmness and sobriety in our emotions for compassion and forgiveness in our hearts
6363767 tout homme qui invoquera le nom de j hovah sera sauv
6363768 quils sont jolis les pieds de ceux qui annoncent des bonnes nouvelles de choses bonnes
6363769 kein sch ner anblick f r den flight enginer auf dem panel leuchten bedrohlich diverse warnlichter
6363770 we are the first non limerick team to win the munster final in over 20 years
6363771 we have the added bonus of being trained by ray gadsen who is the first team coach for tralee rugby club and also the munster youth rugby development officer
6363772 im looking forward to coming up against mark because i have known him for a few years now and i used to stay with him when i raced in the isle of man
6363773 its great for the event to be attracting such top quality riders and im sure that this years competition is going to be very tough and very close
6363774 each stage presents its own challenges but i will be looking to the two stages in kerry the one that finishes into dingle and the one that starts in killarney as my main ones
6363775 kerrys always had a real strong association with cycling and that stretches back to the 1950s with the likes of gene mangan paudue fitzgerald and mick murphy
6363776 cycling is a big sport in kerry and for the county to have three men on the national team is unprecedented and its a great achievement
6363777 its great to have so much of the tour in kerry as well and that will just add to the whole excitement of the occasion
6363778 this is the biggest ever tour so i know that its going to be a real slog but i would be hopeful of finishing well
6363779 we have a good team and i think we will do well against some of the world class teams that will also be competing
6363780 s was asked on lunchtime with eamon keane on newstalk if he would or wouldnt manage dublin
6363781 these are jobs that are offered to you i dont think its a job that you go out looking for
6363782 i would say at this point in time that dublin would find it very hard to be looking outside their own county theyre a very very proud county
6363783 they have a lot of very good men available to them in their own county at the moment and id be very surprised if they did decide to go outside the county to be honest
6363784 ah well now thats a very farfetched question any player who went back to management or managed his county team of course he would give the dublin job very serious consideration its a very attractive job
6363785 all managers would look at that and would take it into account they would i wouldnt be on my own in saying that there are plenty of other people who would as well
6363786 any manager going into the dublin job would be looking at a minimum of two years and a maximum of three years paul caffrey and at this point in time i want to complement paul caffrey people are very quick to forget that man has been very successful with dublin
6363787 i dont know whether i would or not youre putting words into my mouth maybe if you might go up to north kerry you might get someone there
6363788 following on the success of the topper world championships which were hosted in the club in july we expect the musto irish optimist championships to be an even bigger and more spectacular event
6363789 we are delighted to facilitate youth sailing and to encourage these young sailors to improve their racing skills to become outstanding international sailors representing their country in optimist and in other classes of boats as they get older
6363790 tralee bay sailing club has been successful in attracting this major national event as a result of some major development and investment in the club over the past few years including a new sailing school and a new dinghy park which received grant aid from the department of arts sports and tourism
6363791 we would encourage everyone to come to fenit during these four days to enjoy the wonderful spectacle seeing over 200 of irelands top youth sailors competing in the beautiful tralee bay which is reputed to be one of the best sailing areas in western europe
6363792 hes in his seventies now but he has set up a gym in his house where he still works out in the r s he fell and broke his collar bone
6363793 the next morning a couple of men lifted him onto his bike literally hoisted him up and put him into racing position he completed that stage and won the entire race
6363794 im going to take a break from it for a while now
6363795 no one knows what the future holds and the pull of the olympics is huge so i will rule nothing out down the line the one thing i will say is that the four year cycle that we did starting after athens in 2004 and finishing now is probably too long and its something that needs to be looked
6363796 we should take notice of the danish crew some of their rowers only came back for this year and they won the event maybe thats the way to go
6363797 but for me its all about the olympics and thats the only event that can motivate me and bring me back the chance only comes around just once every four years and while thats a long time to wait the olympics are the olympics
6363798 i am after a tough last 18 months when we failed to qualify for the olympics last season so i just want a break from it its time to take stock of everything from my point of view
6363799 i am after a great rowing career with some great results and i have been to the olympics in athens and now in beijing so i have had a great time but the one medal that i want i havent got
6363800 i have six world cup medals and have been on world championship podiums twice so i am very grateful for the career that i have had
6363801 what happens in the future will happen but for now its time for me to take a few steps back and live life outside of rowing for a while
6363802 we prepared very well for these games and up to the semi final it was going well even though we had to go through the repachage
6363803 but we just didnt perform in the semi final and thats a huge disappointment to all of us we needed to row an aggressive race but for whatever reason it just didnt work out
6363804 we knew that we hadnt been great off the blocks at the start and we tried to work on it but we were still found wanting and when we needed to find that something extra during the semi it just wasnt there
6363805 for me on a personal level and for all the lads this is a big disappointment but we have to stay positive here it didnt work out like we would have hoped but thats sport
6363806 i am over here until tuesday so i am going to try and see as much as i can after we finished sixth in athens i didnt see or do anything after but this time i want to make the most out of this olympics and live the whole experience
6363807 to be honest there was one point this year when i had my resignation letter all typed out and i was ready to hand it to athletic manager of the paralympic council
6363808 i was talking to my wife about giving it all up but she encouraged me to go to an event in switzerland and somehow i managed to achieve my best time in five or six years over there
6363809 i dont know how it happened but it changed everything and here i am now just days away from boarding a plane to beijing
6363810 i am far more optimistic of doing well now then i was a few weeks back
6363811 training has been going well for me and i am happy with preparations i got some good times in the training camp in limerick but i will have to wait and see what the competition is like in beijing before i make any predictions about how i will fare
6363812 a lot of people are asking me who will i get on in beijing and i tell them all the same answer i will do my best
6363813 i am 33 now and while i am delighted to be going to beijing i dont want to just make up the numbers and take up a seat on the aeroplane
6363814 i am in beijing to compete and to do as well as i can thats what i want to do
6363815 my wife and two young children wont be travelling out but they will be with me in spirit and i will be in contact with them all the time as well
6363816 also i just want to say thanks to the staff and management of kerry county council because they have been extremely supportive to me over the years
6363817 muircheartaigh who encouraged as many people as possible from kerry to lend their support
6363818 the walk offers an exhilarating experience to all who participate and a chance to enjoy the scenic beauty of kerrys mount brandon
6363819 it will give them a chance to meet future friends and gain some healthy exercise all in the knowledge that walking these few steps can help save many lives
6363820 it was a really tough final and we were over the moon to come away with the win against a really good
6363821 its great to finally win this competition because we came close last season only losing out in the semi final so its terrific to come out on top this time around
6363822 there was a sudden bump and stones flashed by the window when the train came to a sudden halt i got a strong smell of smoke and that gave us a bit of a fright
6363823 we were not being kept prop erly informed there should have been more communication
6363824 rocks struck all the windows as the train skidded along the line to a sudden stop
6363825 the front of the locomotive came off the track but everything else stayed on the track and upright thankfully nobody was injured
6363826 he was a living in the family home he was a single man very quiet and unassuming
6363827 he retired some time ago from from fry cad bury in rathmore and had spent some time in the united states
6363828 he was very interested in sport and was very much into gaa affairs
6363829 i offer my sympathies to his family as he was very well respected in the area to his immediate family and to his close neighbours in the locality

6363880 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can

6363886 i dont think you can control all the world from one center there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order should emerge
6363887 for the arabs its wishful thinking that this is the end of a unipolar world
6363888 as for the israelis they are exaggerating the resurgence of russian power more than the arabs are out of fear that this scenario will strengthen iran and some of their arab enemies
6363889 i told myself as i was walking to the plate that if its out over the plate im going to swing at it and thats what it was
6363890 sometimes i have to do that because ill get too picky up there and not swing and not be myself
6363891 thats not a routine play because he did a good job to get in front of it and knock it down that would have been a terrific play if he could have made it
6363892 hes got to dive and knock a ball down and get an out all at the same time

6363930 ser a bueno cambiar de color por un ratico para ver la gente como me ve si me ven diferente si paso desapercibido si ya no me buscan tanto si puedo hacer cosas que hace la gente com n y corriente normal y que nadie dice nada ser a por eso
6363931 no me incomoda para nada ser de color lo que pasa es que ltimamente con tanto problemita que he tenido el ltimo haber disparado con un fusil en abril pasado pens que puede ser por racismo porque como siempre me han perseguido por el hecho de ser famoso entonces nunca le hab a prestado atenci n a lo del racismo y esta vez acept el reto de intentar cambiar de color a ver si los problemas que se presentan son por el color o soy yo
6363932 cuando uno tiene un problema siempre me sacan a relucir cosas del pasado y siempre quieren mostrar que yo soy el malo y yo creo que una parte es uno y otra parte creo que es el color que uno carga encima porque sin lugar a dudas me hubieran juzgado diferente si hubiera tenido otro color

6363934 creating nature within a 3d environment involves a high level of complexity
6363935 its challenging to scale in cg while still maintaining credibility we had to twist curl raise and fold the terrain animating in a very unnatural way while preserving the realistic details of the outdoors
6363936 we are very very close to an agreement but its not done
6363937 undoubtedly its true that the negotiators have taken this very very far towards an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement
6363938 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6363939 i am not going into the details now where we are on in specific issues except to say i think all issues have moved forward in a positive way
6363940 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6363941 obviously i will also check progress on the negotiations on the strategic frameworks agreement and on an agreement to allow our forces to continue to operate in

6363943 certain military groups are offering their services to grab him for 1million highly trained soldiers want to get him because of this horrible example of injustice
6363944 they have been used in iraq they said they are willing to get him and it has taken a lot of talking with them to get them to see it is not the way to go
6363945 it would have to be very covert and it would be a tremendous political challenge it would be much better if legal means could cause a breakthrough
6363946 i am absolutely certain the norwegian government would never go into that kind of act to get him out
6363947 the yemen authorities are still holding out and the family can hide behind their constitution the impression is they will not change their mind despite all the public pressure on them
6363948 the father pretends there is nothing he can do as his son is a grown up it seems he is never going to be extradited for a british trial
6363949 if they have not succumbed to pressure now it is not going to happen how can the world live with the fact some nations citizens can be above the law

6363975 it is said that children cant be as free as adults because with freedom comes responsibility and children are not responsible but this line of thinking discriminates against children who would take or do take responsibility for themselves for others and for property it is true that most children are not property owners and therefore usually have to play by the rules property owners set for them my property my rules but this does not justify any person privately or on behalf of the state to violate their rights that is no one has the right to initiate force against a child not parents not teachers and not police who catch one drinking

6363996 we zijn al sinds vorig jaar bezig met het bekijken van de mogelijkheden op die plek zegt harold de beer van atelier architecten in gouda
6363997 maar het is een lastige plek dat heeft te maken met de lokatie maar ook met de eisen die door de gemeente worden gesteld
6363998 het is wel duidelijk dat renovatie van de bestaande panden eigenlijk geen optie is zegt de beer
6363999 dat zou betekenen dat we veel geld daarvoor moeten uittrekken dat je uit de verkoop nooit kan terugverdienen
6364000 het is nog geen uitgewerkt bouwplan we willen eerst van de gemeente weten of ze zich kunnen vinden in de uitgezette koers als dat zo is dan kunnen we verder

6364021 i found this book its mine if you want it you gotta pay me for it
6364022 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6364023 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6364024 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6364025 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6364026 tribal animosity which was sparked by a few elements opposed to peaceful coexistence must never happen again

6364030 its going to be more relaxed and enjoyable for them
6364031 we got all these anxieties and fears out of the way and now theyre ready for school
6364032 weve been drawing pictures and we got to take three books home last week and sometimes ive been going to the library for school books
6364033 dont get me wrong theyre the nicest teachers in the world
6364034 the snp has a strong social conscience which is very scottish in itself
6364035 one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
6364036 the tories have been more constructive than other opposition parties in the scottish parliament but i dont think you have to scratch very hard to see real anti scottish antagonism from many elements of the conservative party i dont think the leopard has changed its spots
6364037 he didnt really approve of me setting foot in the house of commons it was a hell of a moment
6364038 its very difficult to be calm in a room with a bloody big notice that says
6364039 when youre first minister you probably dont find it wise to own up to mistake after mistake
6364040 you wouldnt expect us to be bosom buddies walking arm in arm to the pub for a wee snifter
6364041 i believe in independence for scotland clearly the prime minister doesnt no amount of rapprochement will bring us together on that issue and that applies to a range of other issues too
6364042 which is an even bigger problem than it is in england
6364043 this is difficult because we are tilting against vested interests the power of which you would not believe
6364044 nobody has accused me of wanting to get rid of her i have said nothing about her troubles this idea that i was chasing and harrying her i must be the most restrained politician of all time
6364045 take off accidents are very very rare you reach a point in take off when it is unlikely that anything can go wrong but if things do go wrong they can go wrong very quickly
6364046 on take off pilots reach a point of no return known as v1 speed which is usually reached about two seconds before take off
6364047 if you go above v1 and abort the take off there is insufficient room at the end of the runway and there is the chance of going off the end of the runway at a very fast speed and things can then go very badly wrong
6364048 the normal rule is that if you go beyond v1 and something goes wrong you take off anyway if for example a tyre blew you would take off
6364049 a problem at the point of take off is very challenging for the pilot if something happens at the point of v1 he is committed to taking off
6364050 if there is an engine failure at this point he is flying an aircraft at very low speed
6364051 they should be able to work out whether the plane was in a flyable condition in those last few moments
6364052 deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life
6364053 philip joins me in sending our warm and heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those who have died and our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those who have been injured
6364054 at this difficult time all those affected by this tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers
6364055 the prime minister was deeply sorry to hear about todays tragedy in spain
6364056 his thoughts are with the spanish people and all those affected by the tragedy
6364057 obviously everybody is searching for information and everybody is keen on learning the cause of the accident
6364058 this is a very deeply tragic accident but right now our primary concern is for the family and the next of kin of the passengers and the crew on board
6364059 society has changed fundamentally and the measure of it is that the official fatwa religious edict of old no longer has the hold it had
6364060 a girl or young man who hears a fatwa doesnt just obey he goes to google and hears other opinions and discusses
6364061 do you know the city will be larger than washington
6364062 saudi arabia today doesnt offer the kind of services that are required
6364063 there is a lack of infrastructure and basic urban aesthetic beauty is also missing we have about 60 per cent of our population under 30 and these people need places to live so we are going to create the educational opportunities for them to come study and work
6364064 they are white elephants and not economically sustainable without huge subsidies
6364065 its hard to find serious economists who arent in the pay of the saudis who think it is sustainable
6364066 the king goes to parliament to talk about the need for women to participate but its all nonsense
6364067 the king has good intentions but when it goes down to lower levels there is resistance
6364068 we are putting our faith in king abdullah because obviously hes a reformist
6364069 he represents optimism and tolerance and a progressive way of thinking
6364070 if iran involves itself more in iraq and the americans tried to back the shiites well resort once more to the religious establishment
6364071 de de de de on my way in a deep voice but im not sure if that is whats being said de de de de on my way
6364072 and as it was in the days of noah so it will be also in the days of the son of man they ate they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all

6364076 wenn man jetzt nach l ngerer zeit wieder mit einer neuen telenovela einsteigt muss man allerdings vor allem geduld haben
6364077 jede neue telenovela die diese tonalit t widerspiegelt wird sich auch immer ein st ck weit den vorwurf gefallen lassen m ssen ist das nicht wie vib was aber im detail nicht der fall ist wir erz hlen die geschichte spannend wendungsreich und neu
6364078 eine liebesgeschichte die dramatisch und konfliktreich erz hlt werden muss

6364080 wahnsinnig gut zu verkaufen ich glaube diesen grundkonflikt kennen viele leute
6364081 de laatste maand ziet het er heel goed uit voor mij qua conditie en moraal
6364082 het gevoel is goed op de fiets de hartslag en de recuperatie zijn goed en de power is er het zal zaterdag belangrijk zijn erbij te zijn van in het begin maar toch reserve te houden voor het einde volgens mij gaan veel renners zich opblazen en zullen de ervaren renners beter zijn dan de jongeren
6364083 de klimmetjes zijn iets te steil voor mij de afdalingen zijn wel goed technisch maar niet lang genoeg om tijd goed te maken maar eigenlijk kon het parkoers slechter het wordt alleszins lastig en volgens mij gaan er veel vallen wanneer ze vermoeid in de afdalingen zitten mijn ambitie was begin dit seizoen een top 10 en ondanks een slecht jaar hou ik het daarbij ik heb er goed voor getraind en ik denk nog steeds dat het realistisch is ik wil hier alleszins de beste wedstrijd rijden van mijn comeback na mijn schorsing maar het wordt een aparte koers door de extreme omstandigheden en het is mogelijk dat er op het einde nog veel verschuivingen gebeuren
6364084 die top 10 zit de laatste tijd veel in mijn achterhoofd natuurlijk zijn het hier allemaal toppers en moet ik realistisch blijven maar in een goede dag en op dit parkoers is het volgens mij mogelijk dat parcours is eigenlijk een zware veldrit het ligt me heel goed want het is intensief en er zijn heel weinig recuperatiezones het is een van de mooiste mountainbike omlopen die ik al heb gezien er zijn veel opeenvolgende klimmetjes en afdalingen en je moet constant sturen de mannen met een klein verzet komen hier niet aan hun trekken
6364085 ber das weitere vorgehen werden wir sehr sorgf ltig auf der sitzung des dfb pr sidiums am freitag beraten mit sicherheit aber wird der dfb nun nicht einfach zur tagesordnung bergehen
6364086 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for

6364088 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6364089 arsenal is known for playing technical and skilful football and has a young but experienced squad im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes

6364095 this could give a lot of people the wrong idea
6364096 the obama campaign did not authorize and was not involved in the production of this document senator barack obama has not and will not endorse a candidate in the primary for district 109 state representative or any other miami dade county election on august 26
6364097 ill do this every week go through all the preparations as long as i dont have to go through another storm like andrew
6364098 we had a lot of rain but we havent gotten any reports of flooding or any damage as result
6364099 we were very lucky that we didnt have any strong winds
6364100 there was a little flooding but thats really about it
6364101 the children were very cooperative and my assistant was great
6364102 its always kind of rewarding to be able to help children especially children that are disadvantaged who often times fall through the cracks because they dont have insurance or the means to get an eye exam so sometimes they go without care it made me feel good to do this kind of service
6364103 the low income children affected do not have any access to insurance so it is our mission to provide free optometric exams and provide glasses if needed
6364104 because there is a direct correlation between success in school and being able to see and read
6364105 children in the dependency care system are covered by medicaid
6364106 however vision and dental services have traditionally posed a challenge and programs such as the mobile unit provide a much needed benefit in a streamlined manner
6364107 weve been able to provide service to some children who may not otherwise have received service
6364108 its convenient to be able to come to one location and have that service its worked out really well for the agencies
6364109 we work as a team to ensure they get seen together with all the care they need
6364110 everybody needs to be healthy and happy and operating at their full potential
6364111 it went from where the tribes had no competitors in terms of casino gaming like slot machines to now having some competition
6364112 since the slot machines have been added to now six of the seven seminole casinos
6364113 the numbers are up significantly and theyve gone up in every location where the slot machines have been added
6364114 those numbers are obviously going to be significant in terms of 2008
6364115 this is no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way
6364116 intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible

6364122 se eu tivesse jogado uma olimp ada o brasil teria ganhado a medalha de ouro
6364123 a minha grande frustra o n o ter participado dos jogos pois na minha poca o atleta profissional n o tinha esse direito
6364124 quem perdeu foi a equipe n o o ronaldinho n s t nhamos jogadores bons mas que nunca haviam atuado juntos a verdade que o brasil n o estava preparado

6364134 boy are they narrow minded but oh well dont rock the boat
6364135 doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity
6364136 launching yet another social network or community that doesnt allow users to connect and converse with other communities seamlessly creates the insanity of the moment and robs us of our time and effectiveness
6364137 veel winnaars bellen omdat ze niet kunnen geloven dat ze maar 26 euro gewonnen hebben

6364146 they are remanded for investigations and no charges have been laid against them let natural justice takes its course
6364147 indicates the possibility that the individuals involved may have been victims of entrapment
6364148 the timing of this incident also gives reason to suspect a political motive given our close proximity to the by election in permatang pauh
6364149 if the investigation proves that alleged misconduct did in fact occur in this matter then pkr and our partners in the pakatan rakyat will take swift action against those involved in any impropriety consistent with our commitment to good governance transparency and accountability

6364152 hots brought together people young and old from a wide range of denominations to unite and partner with local snap teams and services across the east of norwich this project offered the police community and christians a fresh opportunity to engage with our local community to make a small difference in many peoples lives we are thankful for the many opportunities to reach out with love and compassionate service during hots
6364153 during hots we had the privilege of running and overseeing several projects to impact the thorpe area of norwich
6364154 we were encouraged at the impact these projects had and the opportunity to meet the local community and build relationships with them on saturday 26 july the family fun day saw over 350 members of the local community join us for food fun and entertainment
6364155 equip was a free multi sports camp for children aged 4 to 13 we ran two programmes at the same time team sports and personal fitness with over 60 children attending a fun filled high energy time was had by all we covered many activities from kwik cricket to kae bo
6364156 at the family fun day we performed four dances for a crowd and a mini sports tournament took place feedback has been very positive one mum even went so far as to say that her daughter was a changed child since attending equip as her confidence and willingness to participate in sport had rocketed this was the kind of response that we were hoping for as it came from a local mum who had not had any previous contact with enyp or church in general
6364157 we thank god for his continued provision in the work undertaken for the relationships in the community which continue to be built and pray that his will and work will unfold over the coming months
6364158 no 2 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view

6364164 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 dollars an ounce
6364165 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6364166 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations
6364167 so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6364168 so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6364169 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost

6364183 duyvendak rept van een klimaatcrisis maar hij zou respect moeten tonen voor de feiten
6364184 duyvendak stelt dat het 0 7 graden warmer is geworden maar hij vertelt niet over welke periode satellieten tonen over de afgelopen anderhalf jaar iets anders het is in korte tijd wereldwijd 0 6 graden kouder geworden
6364185 daar klopt niets van zelfs het ipcc verlaagt keer op keer de voorspelde zeespiegelstijging in hun laatste rapport verwacht het nog maar 59 centimeter

6364188 overall the electronics industry has been riding out the storm so far although people are still wary of potential further slowdown in the global economy

6364197 it is expected that the cash flow situation will become tight during the coming year and therefore a dividend of 2 50 rupees per share is recommended for the year 2007 2008

6364276 demand for the consoles is still strong especially in the united states
6364277 in many ways its different to the last difficult period we had because of the lack of availability of mortgages
6364278 this comes against the background of the uks biggest mortgage lender halifax telling us that the value of our homes has slumped by more than 10 over the last year
6364279 its continued worries from the u s that are feeding in over here

6364305 it has been raining heavily and the rivers are overflowing commuting has become a big problem for us
6364306 our standing maize crop has been destroyed and acres of land are in water we won t have anything to eat
6364307 in the second half we could have done a lot better but it was still a decent result for us we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers
6364308 we have got a game before the croatian one against andorra and it is important we build on our previous games and get the points there
6364309 all the players were really disappointed with not qualifying for the euros it really hurt not to be playing there this summer
6364310 but we will give 110 per cent to try and qualify for the world cup and we needed that sort of test against the czechs going into the qualifiers
6364311 we needed a tough game and i think we got it they were really physical and well organised
6364312 there is more to come but we are always confident we can beat any team if we play at our best and we feel we can get it right in those games ahead
6364313 i had a lot of touches in the first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6364314 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6364315 what people have got to realise as well is it is the early days of the season the lads are still getting fit and sharp
6364316 everyone needs to improve we want to win every game as the other games come along i am sure the lads will be a lot fitter and a lot sharper so we shouldnt have a problem
6364317 the manager said it was another step forward we know we have to improve we are going to improve no doubt about that i keep saying it is early in the season we have played only one league game
6364318 so you can see boats on fire and pretty much you can see the flames right up to the roof
6364319 theres a big tunnel of grey smoke just pouring up above it and over the freeway and out to the east
6364320 friendly matches are in the domain of fifa it is not uefas responsibility
6364321 unfortunately this is not a new thing but there are no sanctions we can impose
6364322 we ran a successful campaign during the european championships to get fans to respect their opponents national anthems
6364323 its about education and we can only hope that respect is shown
6364324 the sfa is obviously disappointed that a minority of of our fans chose not to respect the visitors national anthem
6364325 the tartan army have a richly deserved reputation as fantastic ambassadors for their country

6364333 we are very very close to a sofa status of forces agreement but its not done
6364334 undoubtedly its true that the negotiators have taken this very very far towards an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement
6364335 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6364336 i am not going into the details now where we are on in specific issues except to say i think all issues have moved forward in a positive way
6364337 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6364338 tra neppure un mese la macchina della scuola italiana ricomincer a macinare lezioni ed esami
6364339 just five years ago last week on august 14th 2003 this country got an object lesson in how big a gamble were taking with our future if we dont change course
6364340 we learned that this time the enemy was us and our failure to take care of our infrastructure
6364341 the worlds greatest nation was shown to have a power grid that was seriously over strained and out of date
6364342 i believe that weve got to be willing to do what some other nations such as france have already done and increase our capacity of safe and clean nuclear generated power
6364343 draw power from the tides of the hudson and east rivers something were already doing on a pilot basis
6364344 which weve estimated could meet nearly 20 percent of the citys need for electricity
6364345 want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can
6364346 we offer the chance to go on loan to any of the interested english clubs
6364347 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
6364348 billions of people in the world live without sustainable access to safe drinking water or suffer ill health due to poor sanitation
6364349 it is indicated that 30 percent of the worlds population in 50 countries will suffer from water shortages in 2025
6364350 to this point ive felt like i put a lot of work into getting ready for this season and i havent gotten a lot out of it
6364351 a game like this shows me that the work im doing is paying off it helps build my confidence because this has been a long tough year i just want to get things going in the right direction to finish off this season
6364352 the first 10 games i played i was going up there every time feeling like i had to get a hit to stay up here
6364353 i know ive got to perform and produce to stay here but whatever happens happens tonight i was just going to have fun and i think that helped
6364354 we have already achieved the millennium development goals for halving water and sanitation and we are well ahead of our target to achieve universal access by 2014
6364355 i know that you know about the beauty of our country and our biodiversity but you also know that madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world
6364356 which equates to a total coverage of 88 percent and 74 percent of the population respectively
6364357 south africa is extremely well placed to host the next event after turkey in 2009 as this would bring the focus and all the activities of awareness to africa and in particular to the southern hemisphere
6364358 if you are to transform a nation you must attend to some basic things first and that is why water and sanitation are so important
6364359 madagascar is fully aware of how important water sanitation and hygiene are to health community development and even to the economic development of the nation
6364360 more than the number dying from malaria measles and aids combined
6364361 do you think children in america or sweden die because of diarrhoea or bad drinking water no it doesnt happen in the 21st century why should it happen in africa
6364362 we are not talking about something as complex as building a rocket to take people to the moon we are talking about teaching children to wash their hands with soap to use proper sanitation techniques and about improving access to clear water for villages
6364363 and we are not talking about designing the latest computer we are talking about helping people to drill wells and use water pumps and collect rainwater on their roofs
6364364 all it requires are common sense strategies a little creativity and the wisdom to use proven and effective strategies used in many countries around the world
6364365 but given the urgency of addressing these challenges i concluded we needed a ministry dedicated exclusively to this mission
6364366 maar mensen houden er een onbehaaglijk gevoel aan over en het lijkt op misleiding
6364367 we willen wel benadrukken dat je natuurlijk zelf beslist of je terugbelt en hoe lang je naar zon bandje luistert al willen veel mensen nu eenmaal graag weten wie er gebeld heeft dat is logisch

6364388 she was a child she thought as a child and she wrote as a child
6364389 good writing always stands the test of time and trends but in the eyes of many critics blytons continued success is an enigma because her work is considered to be exceptionally poor hollow plots repetitive storylines two dimensional characters limited vocabulary and bland unliterary penmanship are all evident throughout her 700 plus books

6364454 lo que hemos dicho es en primer lugar que un estado debe defenderse contra la amenaza del terrorismo y que cuando se habla de fronteras hay que considerar el contexto general es decir la violaci n continua de las fronteras por parte de las farc

6364460 estoy en condiciones de asegurarle que tal afirmaci n es absolutamente falsa ya que la oea no tiene ni misiones especiales ni funcionarios de ning n nivel desplegados en la frontera norte de ecuador por lo que resulta imposible que alg n miembro de esta organizaci n haya formulado tal declaraci n

6364528 i see more multiple issues with people now it is three four five issues with one of them being my house is in foreclosure thats one of the toughest things we hear
6364529 so many of them are struggling day to day and that one thing just kind of sends them over the edge
6364530 i just reassure them that it is a difficult step so many people are embarrassed to do it but they are helping their families by doing that
6364531 are you telling me that this is actually more difficult than going through the cancer treatment
6364532 if they have a favorite character favorite color well even go into our reserve and try to match them up with something thats really special to them
6364533 it might seem like a small thing but seeing that child walk out with that special backpack and just feeling so pleased about it is enough for us
6364534 a lot of people think in this school district that we dont have a lot of need but we do approximately 10 percent of children attending our elementary schools live with families that cant provide the basic school supplies needed for each semester
6364535 if we can help create a level playing field for disadvantaged children as they enter the school year there are multiple positive results from that
6364536 it boosts their self esteem but from a more practical standpoint it gives them the tools that they need to continue their educations successfully
6364537 the true reason will be that it will kill everything some of the them have worked for their whole lives
6364538 then in the next election some of them will be gone if that happens there goes the democratic party in center township
6364539 if you do that youre not worthy of your jobs
6364540 the ability to expand the curriculum is limited by both enrollment and economic factors
6364541 it is the administrations belief that the merged district will provide programs for students that would otherwise be impossible
6364542 simply said we believe that we can accomplish more together than any one district can accomplish apart
6364543 what is important is that everybody was at the table trying to work it out
6364544 the education of the kids is what we have to keep in front of us
6364545 we hope every student will find their niche before they leave here
6364546 they are required to demonstrate to the department that they have planned for the most effective technologies for removing hazardous pollutants from the emissions
6364547 we are continually looking for ways to tweak our system to better our controls but the technology in my opinion will stay the same
6364548 that date will still find much of the high school complete and turned back to us
6364549 but the contractors still will be hanging around for a month or two into 2008 09
6364550 we will essentially open this year much like we closed last year
6364551 there will be some areas of the building that will still be under construction but the majority of the space will be available to us for use
6364552 we will bring in food from other kitchens and cook on portable gas grill outside just like we did in may of last year
6364553 the football team is setting up their operation at the mount royal school for august and might have to stay with that format a couple weeks into the year which means the mount royal middle school is without a locker room as school opens
6364554 why would you throw money away like that its not fair for the buyers of older houses to have to pay taxes from the day they move in when the buyers of newly built homes do not you cant have two standards
6364555 but when im a senior is anyone going to make anything for me
6364556 you have this mind set that your senior year is going to be your year instead were going to be like the new kids in a whole new school
6364557 its like a big experiment and were the lab rats
6364558 i dont like that it will be our last year
6364559 there will be more teachers to pull from and our funding will be better
6364560 i think there will be more opportunity having a bigger class
6364561 when you go apply to colleges and youre in the top 10 percent of your class but its only a class of 50 what does that mean
6364562 were going to stay with our group and theyre going to stay with theirs
6364563 theyre going to push us all together and think its going to go well and its not going to happen
6364564 i think theyre just going to play the center kids and not the monaca kids
6364565 i was born in monaca and have gone to school there my whole life
6364566 now were going to have new teachers and theyre not going to know you in monaca everybody knows you
6364567 everyone goes to the football game every friday it just wont be that exciting at a new school
6364568 i think if were winning it will all be fine
6364569 should have more functions to try to get the monaca kids and the center kids to communicate
6364570 you need to have the 2010 11 seniors more involved
6364571 if its a vote were going to win just because were bigger

6364575 this announcement of ea putting the first of its kind video game testing centre in the us right here in baton rouge is a terrific win for the city and the future of our state

6364584 were mortgaging the future of people who cant vote and might not even be born yet
6364585 weve got a super subprime crisis brewing namely the federal governments finances
6364586 the factors that caused the mortgage based subprime crisis to explode exist for the governments finances the difference is its 25 times at least bigger
6364587 our trade equation guarantees massive foreign investment in the u s when we force feed 2 billion daily to the rest of the world they must invest in something here
6364588 if we do run a third bike it would be up to the sponsors and the management who the rider is but anthony west could be part of the package that we offer
6364589 in misano we should be able to confirm that melandri has joined us and we should be able to clarify the situation with the third bike
6364590 the success is undoubtedly due to the sheer hard work and commitment of students and staff in securing the best results in the history of the school
6364591 when we opened five years ago educational standards here were rock bottom it has taken five years to turn around because standards had been so low for so long and so much was needed to be done
6364592 theres still a long way to go because we believe that we can achieve far more
6364593 temos que confiar na frica do sul citem um pa s que tenha a seguran a 100 garantida
6364594 take off accidents are very very rare you reach a point in take off when it is unlikely that anything can go wrong but if things do go wrong they can go wrong very quickly
6364595 on take off pilots reach a point of no return known as v1 speed which is usually reached about two seconds before take off
6364596 if you go above v1 and abort the take off there is insufficient room at the end of the runway and there is the chance of going off the end of the runway at a very fast speed and things can then go very badly wrong
6364597 the normal rule is that if you go beyond v1 and something goes wrong you take off anyway if for example a tyre blew you would take off
6364598 a problem at the point of take off is very challenging for the pilot if something happens at the point of v1 he is committed to taking off if there is an engine failure at this point he is flying an aircraft at very low speed
6364599 they should be able to work out whether the plane was in a flyable condition in those last few moments
6364600 obviously everybody is searching for information and everybody is keen on learning the cause of the accident
6364601 it didnt matter any of it the grueling battle to retain my souls integrity the long pressing down will upon desire in moments i had gone lifetimes all that power dormant sleeping only needing the detonation of a touch to trigger a chaos in mind which subservient to passion minds will extinguished in bodys will

6364604 it was a really good team effort and we followed on well from what we achieved in the western force game last week
6364605 this was a completely different team we were up against and it was a very committed display from the players especially as we finished the match with 13 men this was against a side who put out their best team and whose competition starts next week
6364606 our work off the ball was very good and another pleasing factor was that all our tries came from turnover ball which means we are adapting well to the elvs there is obviously still a long way to go but if there is one thing we have seen with the elvs its that teams are looking to play a lot more with unstructured ball
6364607 weve spoken to the players about the need to play for the team because that is the most important thing and we saw that in toulon
6364608 although while viewing pornography may be a popular use case due to the nature of content on the web assuming that this is the only reason that users need private browsing trivializes the overall feature for instance users may wish to begin a private browsing session to research a medical condition or plan a surprise vacation or birthday party for a loved one
6364609 its a business decision and i think its a very calculated one

6364614 turkey has assisted other countries in fire fighting before this is normal for us
6364615 i dont know their names but they are brave men and they have done a great thing for my country
6364616 one of the reasons is related to the rapid increase in the number of beijing hotels
6364617 so the drop in occupancy rate does not necessarily mean an overall drop in tourists figures
6364618 we believe that holding the olympic games will leave a lot of tourism resources to beijings tourism industry
6364619 the iraqi and american sides have reached agreement on most of the issues except for a few that are still outstanding
6364620 we shouldnt overstate the significance of that game we were feeling the effects of a tough champions league game against barcelona and we had a really bad day
6364621 aside from that game we have done well against bremen in recent seasons
6364622 every coach has his own style but i think we have started to embrace his philosophy everything is gelling and we have a healthy balance of fun and discipline when we are working

6364700 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6364701 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6364702 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers

6364708 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6364709 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6364710 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6364711 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6364712 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6364713 who are open to doing something on the production side
6364714 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6364715 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans

6364729 while weve always been cost conscious we never recommend handbags with super high price tags we still mix in a bit of the fantastical maybe an article here and there about shopping in a european city now were focusing on more information about contests readers can enter to win big and pulling forward all our usual information about web sales and discounts so its easier for readers to access
6364730 its all about putting the information at the fingertips of our readers as readers start to shop for fall fashions were working on special discounts with fashion and beauty e tailers that will continue through september

6364737 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6364738 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6364739 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6364740 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6364741 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6364742 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6364743 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6364744 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6364745 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6364746 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6364747 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6364752 wir freuen uns dar ber mit torsten ostmeier einen country manager in unseren reihen zu haben der den markt von beginn an kennt er hat unseren kunden wie auch unserem unternehmen bereits wichtige impulse gegeben mit ihm und seinem team werden wir unseren wachstumskurs beibehalten
6364753 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6364754 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6364755 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6364756 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6364757 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6364758 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6364759 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6364760 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6364761 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6364762 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6364763 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6364764 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6364765 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6364766 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6364767 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6364768 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6364769 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6364770 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6364771 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6364772 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6364773 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6364774 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6364775 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6364776 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6364777 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6364778 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6364779 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6364780 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6364781 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6364782 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6364783 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6364784 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6364785 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6364786 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6364787 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6364788 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6364789 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6364790 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6364791 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6364792 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6364802 der tecdax versucht das niveau um die 792 punkte zu verteidigen was ihm heute recht gut zu gelingen scheint
6364803 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6364804 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6364805 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6364806 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6364807 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6364808 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6364809 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6364810 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6364811 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6364812 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6364813 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6364814 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6364815 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6364816 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

6364837 the emissions trading scheme must do whats right for the climate and for all australians not whats good for a few big polluters seeking a golden handshake mr henry said
6364838 there appears to be a growing chorus of big carbon emitters calling for weak carbon targets and special treatment as part of the governments response to climate change he said
6364839 it may only be 14 companies in the data but i think you can take it pretty clearly that the way those 14 companies react would be pretty typical of the industry sectors he said

6364844 the government will await the report by acma before determining any further action he said
6364845 al manar is renowned for inciting violence and hatred the commission said in a statement
6364846 in this respect it appears to have breached the relevant broadcasting code of practice in inciting racial hatred

6364906 so sorry i seem to have gotten the wrong address
6364907 what do you want me to say obviously im disgusted with how i ran i have made a lot of sacrifices i think i ran the perfect race maybe i should have gone at 300 metres but instead i said id relax and just try to kick in
6364908 no no one knows what ive put into it i just know there are a lot of prominent names saying were not great theres so much negativity coming from the top down and thats sad i think its about time for the older people to back us instead of putting us down
6364909 instead these people should be coming on our side like standing next to thomas chamney and telling him what a great achievement it is to come here or stand next to myself its easy to sit back and point fingers and thats not like it used to be
6364910 even tariku bekele younger brother of kenenisa would be a legend back in the 70s and you dont even consider him here thats what people need to look at to come together and support
6364911 i know mark carroll has felt alone out at these things too look at the people that have experience and ask them to help because no one is helping theyd rather just comment dont stay stuck in the 70s and 80s i know we had legends at the time its a different sport now
6364912 john treacy i respect him as an athlete but honestly its such a different sport today i dont know how he would do today in the world cross country hes a great athlete of his time and a champion but why dont we use that brain instead of saying why cant we match the performance of john treacy obviously we cant its a new era
6364913 we get it all the time at every championship how weve failed no one is ever happy with our performance because we dont match what it used to be like ive seen it in the irish character but we have a goldmine of experience even with sonia and were not using it of course people have to make their own choices
6364914 i know some of the more high profile members might not have run as well as they would have hoped but its not for the lack of trying
6364915 all the distance runners are based in the states id love there to be a better set up in ireland but its going to take a mind change as much as lets just build the facilities middle distance running has really gone downhill id love for it to be different
6364916 you re so hop on walter s dick and go for a hard ride
6364917 foreign aid provides a windfall of resources to recipient countries and may result in the same rent seeking behavior as documented in the curse of natural resources literature in this paper we discuss this effect and document its magnitude using panel data for 108 recipient countries in the period 1960 to 1999 we find that foreign aid has a negative impact on institutions in particular if the foreign aid over gdp that a country receives over a period of five years reaches the 75th percentile in the sample then a 10 point index of democracy is reduced between 0 5 and almost one point a large effect for comparison we also measure the effect of oil rents on political institutions we find that aid is a bigger curse than oil
6364918 ich betrachte das vorgehen der schaeffler gruppe als egoistisch selbstherrlich und verantwortungslos der vorstand kann nicht akzeptieren dass die rechte unserer aktion re mit f en getreten werden continental ist kein willf hriges opfer f r schn ppchenj ger und aus diesem grund lehnen wir das bernahmeangebot der schaeffler gruppe ab und bitten alle unsere aktion re ihre aktien nicht anzubieten
6364919 es ist unser ziel m glichst schnell zu einer l sung im sinne beider unternehmen zu kommen
6364920 solche handlungen sch ren das misstrauen und f hren zu einem wettr sten in europa und dar ber hinaus

6364922 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6364923 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6364924 unless we come with a spirit of cooperation trying to resolve things instead of making things more and more complicated
6364925 a lot of governments dont have positions yet and are going through internal processes where ideas are still festering
6364926 if you dont meet those basic criteria you are not going to achieve success
6364927 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
6364928 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6364929 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6364930 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6364931 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
6364932 this is the very dark side of human nature as a species we evolved with certain characteristics those characteristics may have fostered survival of the species in our prehistoric herd days but they dont fit our life today in fact they are detrimental whatever you think of evolution it was most certainly not intelligent design this herd mentality survives today in numerous ways and our most destructive political systems play on this mentality nazism communism etc
6364933 the pacifist impulse is not a strong one within the current russian leadership which is mostly made up of but barely reformed ex soviets unless russian leaders become less bent on physically ruling the region and firmly credibly commit to co existence with their vulnerable neighbors the nato option simply cannot be discounted some kind of security measure will have to be available to these countries and arguably any will irk the russians and mr friedman who is an educated individual concerning geo political matters ought to know this and provide his commentary on the recent russian v georgian conflict in that light in short what advice does he have for leaders of countries like the republic of georgia given the evident aggressiveness of russia

6364949 mi hermano cumpl a hoy 23 a os nos enteramos por la televisi n pero cuando llegamos aqu nos enteramos que estaba entre los fallecidos a n no hemos podido identificar el cuerpo y toda la familia est muy mal
6364950 en todo momento nos han tratado muy bien y estamos a la espera de comprobar la identidad han hecho una prueba de adn al padre para identificiar a los hijos
6364951 me he venido a ayudar en lo posible he estado toda la noche en ifema ahora estoy aqu ayudando a trasladar a la gente y luego volver a ifema
6364952 la situaci n dentro es muy dura cuando lo recuerdo se me pone la piel de gallina mi funci n es procurar que los familiares se sientan arropados que tengan todo lo que les haga falta e intervenir si les pasa algo esta noche hemos tenido que atender muchos desmayos
6364953 lo m s urgente es acelerar todo el proceso de las autopsias y la identificaci n de los cad veres
6364954 el proceso en el que nos encontramos ahora es el de identificaci n que es un proceso bastante m s lento y que lo est realizando el departamento cient fico de la guardia civil

6364958 in the ongoing battle to let us eat dinner in peace without being interrupted by amazingly annoying telemarketer blather and in this case the even more infuriating recorded telemarketing drivel the federal trade commission today basically outlawed recorded telemarketing calls specifically the ftc changed its venerable telemarketing sales rule tsr to prohibit as of sept 2009 telemarketing calls that deliver prerecorded messages unless a consumer has agreed to accept such calls from a given caller seller between now and 2009 telemarketers must provide an obvious easy and quick way for consumers to opt out of any call the ftc said such an opt out mechanism needs to be in place by december 1 2008

6364968 and it makes us appreciate what we have to give less than 100 percent would be a disservice to all those people
6364969 we are one of the biggest trusts in the country and as we have seen on many other occasions this format involves comparing our trust with much smaller ones so it is very artificial and doesnt allow for a meaningful comparison at any level
6364970 last year cancelled operations represented only a small fraction just over 1 per cent of nearly 100 000 planned procedures carried out at our hospitals
6364971 any cancellation for non clinical reasons is regrettable and is only approved by a senior manager when all options to avoid it have been explored
6364972 we recognise there is room for improvement and we are working hard to further reduce the number of cancellations
6364973 having an operation cancelled can cause huge distress for patients and their families its simply unacceptable that these figures are so high and that the government is spinning the official statistics to try to hide them
6364974 labours boom and bust approach to the nhs finances has made things even worse with bed shortages and staffing shortages in far too many trusts

6364982 as long as youre damaging at least some part of the file
6364983 an extremely high percentage of the hidden files were destroyed
6364984 is it better to know who is doing the attacking or to stop the attack from happening
6364985 sometimes catching an intruder is less important than preventing the potential damage caused by releasing that information
6364986 we are seeing a slow motion disaster for working people as secure jobs evaporate in dunedin and throughout the nation as major players like fisher and paykel and cadbury shut down plant and lay off the workforce
6364987 this is not about efficiency the dedication or skills of our workers it is about how we respond to a global economic system that is out of control and is bad for workers
6364988 workers have been subsidizing their own jobs as these corporations get rates relief and other support from the government but clear out when its convenient for them
6364989 we have to start asking ourselves whether we need a system where working people and communities control and own these enterprises rather than to be continually cast aside and have their lives disrupted we need a regulated economy with a strong local manufacturing base where secure jobs are seen as more important than private profit
6364990 new zealands economic base is on the fast track to becoming a farm with a golf course in the back paddock that is not the recipe for an advanced 21st century society that is a recipe for an imbalanced economy and a wealth and social class divide
6364991 in a few short years transportation costs and environmental pressures will mean that local and regional production will become necessary again but we will have lost the skills and infrastructure by then
6364992 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6364993 let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism
6364994 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6364995 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6364996 our principle focus has been a 50 state voter registration initiative i think we all appreciate that if we increase the number of african american registered voters and then increase turnout and get people to the polls on nov 4 then sen obama will be the next president of the united states
6364997 the causes will have to be provided not only by the company but also by the black boxes which compile all the flight data

6365001 its been almost 50 years im thinking itd have to be a perfect storm
6365002 wed like to see them scale up to a full system beyond just tests sooner rather than later
6365003 the difference is we have molasses that degrades very quickly or oil that dissolves very slowly but provides enough dissolved material to feed the bacteria to do the same job

6365011 and well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves the need for them to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming in to pakistan from afghanistan is limited
6365012 we know weve got to be prepared were fighting a very difficult campaign for anything that may happen
6365013 ill hear what people have to say on the ground but my own view is that other countries have got a contribution to make as well
6365014 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption so that we deal with the problem of narcotics
6365015 we want to see on the ground the delivery of the results
6365016 given the scale and promptness of russias response the script must have been written in moscow

6365025 ik had al lange tijd pijn in mn knie en uiteindelijk is er als gevolg van die pijn op 26 juni dit jaar een r ntgenfoto gemaakt uit de foto bleek dat ik osteosarcoom heb een kwaadaardige vorm van een bottumor deze ziekte komt maar ongeveer tien tot twintig keer per jaar voor in nederland als gevolg van de uitslag ben ik 8 juli opgenomen in het amc in amsterdam en op 9 juli mijn 17 e verjaardag ben ik geopereerd toen is er een botbiopsie genomen en een port a cath aangebracht voor het toedienen van de chemokuren die ik zou krijgen en nu staat voor 17 oktober de chte operatie gepland na w r een aantal chemos en als ik helemaal hersteld ben krijg ik een derde operatie om de plekjes die op mijn longen zitten te verwijderen
6365026 aan het begin wel maar nu niet meer ik zit nu met de ziekte en moet die operatie ondergaan ik kan niet anders
6365027 nee helemaal niet zelfs ik ben juist blij blij dat het overgaat en dat ik weer een gewoon leven kan leiden ik heb nu goede dokters in wie ik vertrouwen heb
6365028 nee helemaal niet ik sta onder toezicht van dokter schaap hij is op gebied van osteosarcoom de beste chirurg in heel nederland kinderen uit alle uithoeken van het land komen naar hem toe wat gebeurd is is gebeurd
6365029 dokter schaap is inderdaad de beste dit is wat hij doet hij amputeert het is zijn werk hem vertrouwen is dus niet zo moeilijk
6365030 tja niet heel veel eigenlijk de eerste paar dagen besef je niet zo dat je een ziekte hebt pas daarna dringt het tot je door en ga je er echt bij stilstaan ook al voelt het dan nog steeds niet als een ziekte later bedacht ik me dat mijn verjaardag de llerlaatste keer is geweest dat ik zelf op twee benen stond
6365031 bang nee helemaal niet hooguit een beetje ongerust je schrikt natuurlijk maar echt bang was ik niet
6365032 maar hoe kan je n et bang zijn als je hoort dat je kanker hebt
6365033 mijn ouders noemen het het monster omdat ze het zo ervaren maar ik heb er niet echt een naam voor
6365034 het stoort me niet je merkt er in principe niks van het zit gewoon lekker en thuis kan je gewoon met je kale kop rondlopen zoals nu het enige nadeel vind ik dat mijn pruik veel steiler is dan mijn echte haar maar binnenkort gaan we kijken of we ergens een pruik met mooie krullen kunnen vinden
6365035 nee mijn wimpers en wenkbrauwen heb ik gelukkig nog anders zie je er meteen zo ziek uit d t had ik wel erg gevonden denk ik nu doe ik gewoon make up op en maak er het beste van
6365036 er zijn zelfs mensen die angelique alleen kennen uit het ziekenhuis sinds ze kaal is die zeggen dan zelfs dat ze het zo moet laten mooi koppie roepen ze dan
6365037 ja ik vind het heel vervelend dat mensen zo snel over iemand oordelen het is niet zo zeer het kijken naar iemand die kaal is maar ook de gedachten die er soms bij gaan mensen kijken gauw afkeurend sinds mijn ziekte ben ik het heel erg gaan vinden dat mensen zo snel vooroordelen hebben over anderen
6365038 ik ben het leven meer gaan waarderen ik ben blij dat iedereen gezond en gelukkig is de rest is niet meer zo interessant daarnaast besef ik me nu ineens dat mensen heel snel klagen al dat geklaag gaat dan over dingen die in vergelijking met mijn ziekte niks voorstellen
6365039 nee dat niet ik voel me niet ziek ik beschouw mezelf ook niet als een ziek iemand maar ik kan er niet onderuit dat ik de ziekte h b en dat is in verhouding met andere dingen veel erger
6365040 zonder iemand een ziekte toe te wensen wel ja als je iets ingrijpends mee maakt kijk je anders tegen dingen aan mijn verandering is zeker positief geweest en ik wens iedereen zon verandering toe maar wel met een andere oorzaak
6365041 zeker niet meer en minder kan eigenlijk niet maar in het ziekenhuis gelooft niemand de dokters dan met zoveel ellende om je heen is dat denk ik moeilijk
6365042 mensen gaan zich afvragen waarom dit nou juist hen overkomt
6365043 we hebben ook familie die zo reageert waarom nou angelique en waarom gebeurt er niks met die schoffies op straat als ik het even zo mag zeggen als er een god was was dit niet gebeurd
6365044 waarom niet ik kan geen andere kant op ik kan niet zeggen nou laat die operatie maar zitten het moet en dus zal je het onder ogen moeten zien wat heeft het dan voor nut als je gaat zitten mokken er zijn toch goede vooruitzichten
6365045 maar voor ons is het soms wel moeilijk hoor zoals ik zei zijn ouders veel meer bezorgd en mijn man en ik hebben allebei tot het eind van het jaar vrij genomen van ons werk daarna kijken we verder dat is best een drastische verandering ons hele leven draait nu om angelique ik leef van dag tot dag met haar hierdoor zakt het optimisme bij mij soms even weg
6365046 ja ik ben veel dichterbij ze komen staan je hebt natuurlijk veel meer met elkaar te maken ze zijn er de hele dag voor me
6365047 we zorgen voor haar de zorgzaamheid is dus groter geworden alles is nu gewoon even angelique
6365048 ja die is voor altijd veranderd we zitten nog lang met elkaar opgescheept haha en dus zal die hechte band vanzelf gaan wennen
6365049 nee natuurlijk niet het slechte deel van me is weg en ik krijg gewoon een prothese met kleren aan merk je er bijna niks van ik heb er geen problemen mee
6365050 niet echt het is gewoon mijn been de tumor is de boosdoener en die gaat ook weg ik heb helemaal geen problemen met de situatie het enige vervelende vind ik in een rolstoel zitten nu kan ik met mijn krukken kleine stukjes lopen maar de stad in gaan kan alleen met die rolstoel dan ben ik honderd procent afhankelijk en mensen vragen constant of het nog gaat het is lief bedoeld hoor maar het hoeft echt niet
6365051 mijn moeder is ermee begonnen en we zijn er samen mee door gegaan ik kreeg de tip van een meisje uit het ziekenhuis zij vertelde dat een web log handig is om familieleden en kennissen op de hoogte te houden want je hebt niet altijd zin om iedereen over de telefoon te woord te staan

6365109 we are trying to understand the regulation of processes that are fundamental to normal cell development and health in humans
6365110 defective cilia are implicated in a wide range of serious illnesses such as polycystic kidney disease retinal degeneration and neurological disorders inappropriate activation of signaling molecules that normally reside at the primary cilium may lead to certain cancers
6365111 ciliogenesis is a fundamental process these structures are found in almost every type of human cell you can imagine
6365112 if we can ever design drugs that will restore the formation and function of cilia even in the presence of cep290 mutations then that would be one way to cure the defects that lead to ciliary diseases

6365116 what our team has identified is an experimental drug therapy that can provide pain relief to patients within 20 minutes
6365117 depending on the individual in my experience one dose can last from 6 to 40 hours the ability of the therapy to provide immediate relief is something entirely new for sufferers of interstitial cystitis
6365118 women who suffer from this condition may find themselves having to urinate ten or more times per day usually have pain or symptom flares after sexual intercourse and frequently have chronic pelvic pain
6365119 to beattributable to a marked increase in post operative hemorrhage in thepatients who underwent uppp 10 9 percent in smokers vs 3 3 percent innon smokers
6365120 men who underwent tonsillectomy alone bledsignificantly more than women 11 2 percent and 5 4 percent respectively
6365121 further investigation of this relationship is needed withstratification of patients by the number of cigarettes smoked andattention to the length of time before and or after surgery thatpatients refrain from smoking
6365122 this agreement is part of a growing movement towards collaborative approaches to first nations health a prime example of our commitment to work together to create meaningful and significant changes that will improve the delivery of health services
6365123 it will make real improvements to the health status of saskatchewan first nations people
6365124 its important that governments work together to close the gap between the health status of saskatchewans first nations people and that of the general population
6365125 this mou will be the instrument to facilitate the development of high quality accessible health and wellness programs for first nations people
6365126 we believe first nations are ready to take control and ownership of a more holistic and forward thinking health and wellness plan that meets the needs of our communities and provides opportunities for our people in all sectors of a health care system
6365127 most importantly this historic evolution of our treaty relationship will help to provide critical health care to first nation children youth and families first providing clearly a more seamless and culturally appropriate service our traditional medicines and approach to wellness must continue to drive change in todays health care system
6365128 prevention strategies often focus onmodifiable risk factors for colonization and aspiration and cansuccessfully reduce ventilator associated pneumonia rates but nosingle strategy completely eliminates ventilator associated pneumonia
6365129 adherence to prevention guidelines is variabledue to costs and lack of education resources and leadership
6365130 the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstratedthat the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced theincidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associatedpneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time ofventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverseevents
6365131 the silver coated endotracheal tubeappears to offer a unique approach because it is the first interventionthat becomes user dependent after intubation requiring no furtheraction by the clinician
6365132 based on the results ofthis trial should clinicians reconsider guidelines forventilator associated pneumonia prevention and use a silver coatedendotracheal tube in all patients requiring intubation and mechanicalventilation in the icu
6365133 the answer is probably yes for the subset ofpatients at very high risk of developing early onsetventilator associated pneumonia such as neurologically impairedpatients or trauma patients because the greatest effect of theintervention appeared to occur during the first 10 days of mechanicalventilation and was clinically relevant with minimal effect onclinician workload
6365134 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit ofsilver coated endotracheal tubes

6365139 the relationship between hiv and ckd is very important for clinicians to address early in patients with hiv and there is a need for resources to help clinicians connect hiv with an increased risk for ckd
6365140 hiv treatment educators also play a pivotal role in the care of patients with hiv which is why we developed resources specifically tailored to their needs and the needs of the patients they work with
6365141 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
6365142 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
6365143 most people are familiar with 20 20 vision and do not realize that the limit of human vision is 20 08 many elite athletes see better than 20 20 which is not surprising since the superior demands of competition require their visual systems to perform at the highest level
6365144 were honored to be entrusted with the vision care for the olympic athletes and team staff while they are in
6365145 through the olympic village polyclinic johnson amp johnson vision care will provide the athletes access to best in class vision care services and products to help them maintain visual health during competition for some athletes who have limited access to vision care services this may be their first opportunity to receive eye care and diagnostic services which can have a significant impact on their everyday lives

6365155 i dont have all the answers but i do have a lot of questions
6365156 i can only accept one offer and doing so means giving up on the benefits of the opportunity i leave behind
6365157 it is strange that you have one official result write it down and then it gets changed
6365158 for ejb 3 x environments we have designed a much more elegant solution than anything else available today read the spec and try out ejb3
6365159 hibernate 1 x and above already abstracts the underlying transaction mechanism jta jdbc whatever have you actually used hibernate
6365160 the spring hibernatetemplate does not do this in fact hibernatetemplate exposes very hibernate specific apis again have you actually used it
6365161 abstracts all the transaction stuff completely out of the code
6365162 spring no longer wants to keep their product up to date with hibernate evolution
6365163 i truly dont get why the fact that we write software that lots of people find useful give it away for free and have a website which we sometimes make changes to makes people hate us so much that they have to write blog posts attacking us
6365164 its like 10 lines of code why dont you just write it yourself and contribute it back
6365165 we so have a pretty deep difference of opinion to the spring team
6365166 in fact did we even attack spring at all apart from removing some out of date information from our own website no
6365167 you obviously dont like me and dont trust the things i say
6365168 stop whining and explain your problem in a way that everyone can understand it
6365169 the end effect is usually that you end up with only unchecked exceptions being thrown from app persistence or dao layer
6365170 in my view exceptions like usernotfoundexception or duplicateloginexception just have to be checked
6365171 i shall request u all to stop this nonsense instead of fault finding please cooperate
6365172 i fail to see why both shops seem to not get along so well
6365173 i believe both spring and hibernate folks should take a bow and a lesson in humility
6365174 by accepting the compliment of having parts of their work being implemented into a coherent whole to be released as a j2ee standard
6365175 after reading this blog and its responses it is unlikely i will ever consider the use of hibernate or spring when i do finally take the plunge into j2ee what interest i had in either of these frameworks has all but disappeared

6365273 this year however with our number of applicants higher than any year of the last decade we have been compelled to make an extremely difficult decision
6365274 because we dont see the tendency to submit more applications tapering off any its probably going to be even more chaotic however it is important to keep in mind that the overall acceptance rate isnt dropping and there is space out there
6365275 im in the top 1 percent to 2 percent of my class im a varsity soccer player i mentor eighth grade girls im the student council vice president and french club president

6365278 i am very happy that i got into the university of chicago
6365279 we had an increase that was close to 20 percent in the number of applicants this year
6365280 it was a very difficult year because we had not only a large number of applicants but they were also exceptional
6365281 next i would say students need to broaden their safety schools and really make sure they do a good job applying to them

6365283 my son told me he could not study any more and went to bed i could not sleep that whole night
6365284 he does kind of stand out i think we were all surprised he didnt get into any of the ivys but one thing weve learned is that the admissions game can be very unpredictable

6365289 we have also made recommendations to ensure that staff are clear about their roles in a work environment that has seen many changes over the past few years
6365290 the incident that triggered this intervention is a real tragedy it follows that the trust should continue to do everything possible to ensure it does not happen again
6365291 we are satisfied that lessons have been learned and the trust is addressing the main concerns by making changes to its systems to reduce the risk of an incident like this being repeated
6365292 i wish to reassure the public that great western ambulance service is delivering better and faster
6365293 we still have challenges ahead but we have made significant improvements in the last 17 months

6365296 this is by any stretch of the imagination a pretty good result

6365361 we decided to do a cover on this disc and we didnt want to do what every other band is doing these days and take a pop or rock song from the 80s
6365362 we figured a song by a band with real metal cred would do best for us this song never got the attention it deserved its an amazingly well written song and even though its not the most complex song

6365387 this year we hope to raise over 207 000 so we can continue to fund vital cancer research prevention information and support services in nsw including the cancer council outreach service a mobile service that travels around nsw to provide convenient access to cancer information and support
6365388 on a local level the cancer council has in the past six months assisted 106 people in the western region with 30 000 in hardship grants which are used for things like phone bills accommodation and electricity
6365389 an additional 20 000 in regional cancer control grants will be given to community organisations in the central west along with 10 sunshade marquees

6365399 last year they had some great plans and came up with some great ideas
6365400 based on the feedback from the students and the teachers they the schools take a lot out of it
6365401 based on the plans there is some good learning going on
6365402 a lot of people really dont know what they want so it gives them a chance to talk to local tradespeople
6365403 i think todays been good because it helps you know what youre letting yourself in for
6365404 also we were told that the pay for a carpenter was good

6365425 in football there are no miracles in football there is hard work to be done with the under 17 under 20 and olympic under 23 teams
6365426 where teams are successful at the youth level you have also have good
6365427 china should start again with the young players and not artificially hire a national coach and change it every year
6365428 there must be some continuity there must be a plan there must be short and long term planning
6365429 the organisation of the beijing olympics will give an impact to the development of football here but when youve seen your mens team going out in the first round then people are naturally not happy with them
6365430 it should have been a chance for chinese soccer to be honored but in the end it was dishonored what has gone wrong there
6365431 now chinese soccer is confronted with its biggest ever crisis our grassroots is withering our professional league is also spiralling downward and can produce few quality players
6365432 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6365433 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6365442 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia
6365443 the murray lakes and coorong wetlands cannot be allowed to die
6365444 its not right that you have one part of the river system that is in virtual flood and the other part that is going to die
6365445 the fact is the lions share of water taken from the murray darling basin every year is taken by nsw victoria and south australia

6365451 highly opportunistic does not come close to the true value of continental does not create trust and lacks a convincing strategic rationale
6365452 following the hard work over the last weeks continental has come to an acceptable overall concept
6365453 for its costumers continental remains a reliable long term partner that is extremely well positioned the continental employees can continue to rely on the clear focus of our concept for the future which we have developed over the last years

6365459 lg continues to focus on what consumers are craving from their mobile phones and the invision is an example of our effort to offer an easy to use multimedia mobile device at an affordable price the invision incorporates all of the latest entertainment technologies in a sleek form factor that is sure to get noticed
6365460 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6365461 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6365462 but our responsibility as leaders of the nation is to seriously examine what are the national consequences to our nation of this radical change in immigration policy
6365463 kay hull therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6365464 i think it is time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether they have got any policy on this at all
6365465 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6365466 the toll has now risen to 18 and there are about 100 wounded
6365467 russia and america are not able to speak with each other about a very very serious problem
6365468 my guess is that after the georgia war the military role of nato as opposed to the political role that it plays through enlargement will become more important
6365469 in the past we have drawn an assumption that confrontation with russia is not going to be a reality in the foreseeable future one of the lessons of the war in georgia is of course that we may have to in the future back up our security guarantees with force
6365470 that there are some countries who are not worth dying over
6365471 russia wants and seeks hegemony but that is a far cry from seeking world domination or the annihilation of the opposing force so it is not a cold war
6365472 there is a very little it can do with practical measures
6365473 neither side wants to revert to a cold war style confrontation it is in neither of their interests nor is it in russias interests to be challenged by a united group of western nations
6365474 nato needs to say this is our vision and this is the way we are going to engage
6365475 nothing concentrates the mind like an enemy what nato has been suffering from since the end of the cold war is the lack of a clear enemy
6365476 we should be very careful about who we extend security guarantees to
6365477 the province had 997 000 registered voters in the 2007 elections so we need that number of signatures to muster the 10 percent required by the law
6365478 this is a free country and they have the right to due process but we will respond as soon as they expressed their intention we will consult with our lawyers
6365479 at the moment ive only read and heard of these things and up till now theres been nothing official
6365480 until i find out any other information im a torino player
6365481 i think english football at the moment has taken over its improved so much its full of world champions and its something that having been 10 years in italy interests me
6365482 de spelen in peking verlopen naar wens de atleten en de nationale comit s zijn tevreden
6365483 na peking keer ik terug naar huis om mijn e mails te kunnen organiseren en om enkele dagen rust te nemen
6365484 wir hatten auf ein paar kursen voriges jahr gute rennen und ich habe in fuji meinen ersten punkt geholt also freue ich mich definitiv auf diese rennen da die neuen grands prix in valencia und singapur auf stra enkursen sind und wir auf solchen strecken schon gute rennen hatten denke ich dass wir gute chancen auf gute ergebnisse haben
6365485 das bringt uns hoffentlich ein paar zehntel und wir k nnen uns besser qualifizieren
6365486 meine ziele f r den rest der saison sind gute zuverl ssigkeit zielank nfte in allen rennen und zur stelle zu sein wenn sich die m glichkeit ergibt
6365487 ich freue mich dass wir endlich wirklich das schnellschaltgetriebe fahren werden wir hatten bislang ein paar gute k mpfe vor allem mit honda und da das getriebe ein paar zehntel pro runde bringt k nnte uns das nach vorne bringen das feld liegt nun so eng zusammen dass jede entwicklung uns n her heranbringen wird
6365488 wir waren zudem auf stra enkursen gut und da im letzten saisonteil zwei kommen k nnte das eine gute gelegenheit f r uns sein
6365489 ich habe pl ne f r die strecke gesehen und es sieht so aus als ob es durch ein paar der neuesten stadtteile geht ich denke es sollte toll aussehen wenn die autos an der marina und den booten vorbeikommen hnlich wie im f rstentum
6365490 we will consider issuing the strong wind signal number three as the typhoon is expected to come very close to hong kong tonight and tomorrow morning we also expect to see a heavy downpour later today

6365496 de laatste maand ziet het er heel goed uit voor mij qua conditie en moraal
6365497 het gevoel is goed op de fiets de hartslag en de recuperatie zijn goed en de power is er het zal zaterdag belangrijk zijn erbij te zijn van in het begin maar toch reserve te houden voor het einde volgens mij gaan veel renners zich opblazen en zullen de ervaren renners beter zijn dan de jongeren
6365498 de klimmetjes zijn iets te steil voor mij de afdalingen zijn wel goed technisch maar niet lang genoeg om tijd goed te maken maar eigenlijk kon het parkoers slechter het wordt alleszins lastig en volgens mij gaan er veel vallen wanneer ze vermoeid in de afdalingen zitten mijn ambitie was begin dit seizoen een top 10 en ondanks een slecht jaar hou ik het daarbij ik heb er goed voor getraind en ik denk nog steeds dat het realistisch is ik wil hier alleszins de beste wedstrijd rijden van mijn comeback na mijn schorsing maar het wordt een aparte koers door de extreme omstandigheden en het is mogelijk dat er op het einde nog veel verschuivingen gebeuren
6365499 die top 10 zit de laatste tijd veel in mijn achterhoofd natuurlijk zijn het hier allemaal toppers en moet ik realistisch blijven maar in een goede dag en op dit parkoers is het volgens mij mogelijk dat parcours is eigenlijk een zware veldrit het ligt me heel goed want het is intensief en er zijn heel weinig recuperatiezones het is een van de mooiste mountainbike omlopen die ik al heb gezien er zijn veel opeenvolgende klimmetjes en afdalingen en je moet constant sturen de mannen met een klein verzet komen hier niet aan hun trekken
6365500 certainly its a victory for national australia bank customers who have been doing it tough after eight interest rate rises in three years
6365501 this decision by the national australia bank is a challenge for other banks to follow
6365502 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6365503 you could argue that banks are in a position to reduce some of the pressure now in advance of the reserve bank making any decision that it does
6365504 we know the banks have had to pay more for money in the last six to eight months because of the result of the global liquidity crisis but we also know that their margins are extraordinarily healthy
6365505 we will review our full costs of funding at the time of any announcement by the rba taking into account any reduction in the official cash rate and do our best to pass on as much as we can to our customers
6365506 we hebben ontdekt dat we de vorm van lycopeen kunnen veranderen door verwerkte tomaten op te warmen en extra olie toe te voegen
6365507 veel gezinnen warmen de restjes van spaghetti de volgende dag op omdat het dan vaak beter smaakt als je dan nog wat olie toevoegt krijg je zelf deze superspaghetti

6365674 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
6365675 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
6365676 while hype may not generate large box office receipts it is sure to become another prong in the right wing attack machine
6365677 citizens united head david bossie might be hopeful that as the campaign moves forward some right wing websites might offer the film as a premium as they have for the books
6365678 in order to get regular voters to go see the movie it will have to garner media buzz on the cable television news networks like the anti obama books have

6365682 bossie is a political hatchet man whose career is based on smears and attacking democrats
6365683 his obama documentary will provide plenty of footage for use on the internet and in commercials but i doubt that in and of itself that
6365684 i assume that the overall theme of obama as socialist agent disguised as cult hero must be resonating in the political marketing surveys of the bossie types and the mccain operatives or they would switch to something more effective
6365685 going back to the days when he was unremitting in his attacks against bill and hillary clinton bossies forte has never been accuracy
6365686 it has been bloodletting and in that regard if hype gets any traction at all it is likely to be viewed as the political counterpart of the horror movie franchise saw v due to be released just before the election

6365722 as the government we have to be very conscious that any decision to shield one sector or increase the protection to one sector will inevitably place greater costs on other parts of the community and other parts of the economy senator wong said
6365723 the emissions trading scheme must do whats right for the climate and for all australians not whats good for a few big polluters seeking a golden handshake mr henry said
6365724 there appears to be a growing chorus of big carbon emitters calling for weak carbon targets and special treatment as part of the governments response to climate change he said
6365725 it may only be 14 companies in the data but i think you can take it pretty clearly that the way those 14 companies react would be pretty typical of the industry sectors he said

6365742 acma is analysing current broadcasts by al manar and will report to government on whether any of its broadcasts offend the counter terrorism standards senator conroy said
6365743 the government will await the report by acma before determining any further action he said
6365744 al manar is renowned for inciting violence and hatred the commission said in a statement

6365766 they do not have a mechanism of punishment in case of acts of fraud the mortgage law will give people more choice because they will not be limited by the amount of money they have
6365767 with the mortgage legislation they will be able to purchase properties which cost 100 000 or 150 000 these houses will be completed ones and the buyer will be able to move into a fully completed house without facing any problems
6365768 it will definitely be lower than the interest rates of the banks both for ytl and for foreign currencies
6365769 we are delighted that ben has agreed to extend his playing contract for a further two years
6365770 he is the ultimate professional in terms of attitude work ethic and performance these qualities rub off on other players which means he plays a key role on and off the field
6365771 whilst his cricket will remain a priority we want our younger players to benefit from his skills hence the offer of the full time post as a specialist fielding coach
6365772 this is an important opportunity as it allows me to continue playing for worcestershire ccc which is of paramount importance to me but also enables me to start developing a future career in cricket
6365773 since joining the county in 2002 i have seen the team develop a blend of youth and experience which augurs well for the next few years and i really look forward to being an integral part of what we all believe will be great success on the field

6365788 non si pu addossare agli usa la responsabilit di quanto accade in georgia
6365789 burns una persona che in veste di sottosegretario di stato fino a poco tempo fa ha contribuito a elaborare la politica statunitense nei confronti della georgia
6365790 e quindi inverosimile che trovi dei difetti proprio in quelle politiche
6365791 non possiamo permettere che la situazione attuale tracci nuovi confini in europa e impedisca che un governo democraticamente eletto entri nella nato se vuole
6365792 avevamo tutte le ragioni di sostenere il diritto allindipendenza del kossovo
6365793 gli usa hanno fatto di tutto per sostenere lindipendenza del kossovo senza che costituisse un precedente
6365794 quello che lamministrazione non capisce che agli occhi di tutti apparso come un precedente
6365795 non spetta a noi decidere come devono reagire gli altri a quello che facciamo
6365796 ci significa che i leader dellabkhazia e dellossezia del sud non hanno gli stessi fondamenti legali dei leader democraticamente eletti di georgia e russia ossezia del sud e abkhazia non essendo indipendenti non hanno un governi de iure riconosciuti a livello internazionale tuttavia entrambe le regioni hanno governi e leader di fatto che agiscono in modo indipendente inoltre poich gli usa citano continuamente lo status democratico della georgia come forte ragione per sostenerla molti restano incuriositi dal fatto che non si parli mai del referendum del 2006 nellossezia del sud in cui la popolazione si espressa allunanimit per lindipendenza indipendentemente dal fatto che siano democraticamente eletti in base agli standard internazionali o meno i leader della regione separatista di certo rappresentano legittimamente questa posizione se chiedete alla popolazione delle due regioni dove vogliono vivere se indipendenti o sotto lo stato georgiano palese che la leadership ne rappresenti la posizione

6365850 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6365851 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6365852 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist

6365880 within in the next six months to one year the exact date of this mission will be determined
6365881 currently there are no signs of excessive domestic demand conditions in namibia and underlying inflationary pressures have primarily been driven by exogenous factors including high international oil and food prices
6365882 this creates challenges for us where monetary policy actions are not likely to impact the exogenous factors but the same factors are likely to impact inflation expectations
6365883 however surging oil and food prices have had a significant upward pressure on import costs and inflation in namibia
6365884 if the bank is convinced that there are no inflationary pressures due to domestic demand it will mainly act if there is a threat to maintaining the currency peg
6365885 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6365886 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6365887 we take full responsibility and accept the penalties nascar has levied against us today
6365888 there will also be an additional monetary fine beyond the amount announced by nascar earlier today which will be the responsibility of those involved
6365889 we are however disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6365890 my targets for the rest of the season will be to have good reliability finish all the races and be there if there are opportunities to score points
6365891 i am pleased we will be able to actually race the new seamless shift gearbox now weve been having some good fights so far particularly with honda and with the gearbox worth a couple of tenths per lap this may just move us in front the field is so close now that any new developments will move us closer
6365892 over the summer break ive been training in the mountains and working on my fitness for the second half of the year which will be tough with the four flyaway races at the end of the season
6365893 we had some good races at the same circuits last year and i scored my first point in fuji so for sure i am looking forward to these races
6365894 looking to the next race in valencia we will be using the seamless shift gearbox for the first time at a race and hopefully that will give us a few tenths to be able to qualify a bit better this has got to be the goal for the second half of the year
6365895 the three week break is actually an opportunity for the race team to take some time off as its been a very busy few months with the testing and racing with the season being 18 races this year its a long season and its good to take time off while its a bit quieter
6365896 we didnt completely shut down though following the tests and running of the seamless shift box in hungary weve gone over the data and are making sure we are fully prepared for its introduction under race conditions in valencia we also took part in the rotterdam racing event which was great fun for the team and the drivers
6365897 going to new circuits presents a different challenge for the team but its an interesting challenge for the engineers as well as the drivers and valencia in itself will be a fascinating and unique event

6365990 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6365991 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6365992 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course

6366010 these gas prices were really killing a lot of them
6366011 he was not afraid of taking decisions and he disliked long discussions in cabinet he looked people straight in the eyes and told them just what he thought he had no secret agenda and never pulled any punches
6366012 not at that stage but it would inevitably lead to that once you admit that they have to be included in cabinet you also admit they are part of the south african citizenry and have the right to be part of government
6366013 when i met pik in his office after the sterrewag meeting he was bursting with enthusiasm he could hardly contain himself it was his account of the policy changes agreed to at the meeting that i used in the draft i prepared as an input for pw bothas durban speech it is my clear impression that pw had agreed to these changes so i was not particularly concerned that he might reject them
6366014 the political involvement of blacks at the highest level citizenship for all south africans and the concept of a single territory for the whole of south africa
6366015 co responsibility for decisions on the highest level that affect the entire country one citizenship and one undivided south african territory
6366016 pik botha spoke with great enthusiasm and several times said gentleman we are crossing the rubicon
6366017 pik botha would definitely try to extract the maximum political and diplomatic advantage from the sterrewag recommendations but he would certainly not lie or deliberately mislead
6366018 the implementation of the principles i have stated can have far reaching effects on us all i believe that we are today crossing the rubicon there can be no turning back we now have a manifesto for the future of our country
6366019 most important announcement since the dutch settlers arrived in south africa 300 years ago

6366022 i am not going to let people like chet crocker prescribe to me the kind of speech i must make
6366023 that morning pw botha demanded to know who was involved in providing inputs for the speech he picked up all the inputs and threw them on the table
6366024 i will not make that speech i shall make my own speech
6366025 we sat there like a bunch of little children listening to him reading his speech to us no one protested in fact everyone nodded in agreement
6366026 pw botha showed an absolute lack of understanding of modern political communication instead of addressing his real audience of hundreds of millions of tv viewers in the west he addressed the np faithful instead of language that his real audience could understand he used the rough and tumble idiom of south african political meetings instead of a short well rehearsed statement containing the message he wanted to convey he delivered a long rambling speech
6366027 i tried to persuade the media that the reformist elements on which we all waited were hidden under all the aggression and kragdadigheid forcefulness
6366028 i think michael jordan is the best athlete in the world not only for how he played the game but for all he did to grow the sport of basketball

6366045 the assumption that spending more of the taxpayers money will make things better has survived all kinds of evidence that it has made things worse
6366046 these figures highlight the global success of mobile broadband and the fact that we are continuing to see greater and greater economies of scale
6366047 this is driving down the cost of devices and equipment and enabling more and more users across the world to enjoy easy access to media rich services anywhere at anytime
6366048 but equally its hardly productive and the bigger point is it shows a considerable lack of professionalism among key parts of the foreign ministry

6366051 while numerous companies are attempting to gain credibility as good corporate citizens consumers are overwhelmed by the myriad of communications and are at times unable to distinguish the legitimacy some companies who are doing relatively little with respect to corporate social responsibility csr are perceived as just as responsible as those spending millions of dollars incorporating sustainability into their businesses

6366059 we expect cellular based femtocells to have taken over the baton from uma and sip based wi fi solutions by 2013 seizing 62 of the market
6366060 although uma based wi fi solutions have seen early gains in greenfield markets these solutions have not proliferated much outside their current carrier footprints this can be attributed partly to the carriers desire to assess femtocell developments but also to lingering concerns regarding the concept of wi fi based fixed mobile convergence
6366061 lidea di una card alimentare per gli anziani poveri pu apparire una soluzione momentanea che il governo da buon padre di famiglia concede benevolmente ai figli pi disagiati e poveri in realt rappresenta una logica caritatevole che offende la dignit delle persone anziane che hanno bisogno di ben altra attenzione e di ben altri interventi a partire da una legge sulla non autosufficienza da una efficace tutela del potere dacquisto delle pensioni collegate realmente alla dinamica dellaumento dei prezzi e delle tariffe di sevizi sanitari e socioassistenziali adeguati e efficienti di un sistema di informazione e formazione che dia nuove opportunit di conoscenza alle persone anziane inoltre quello che si da con una mano si toglie con laltra le sempre pi scarse risorse nelle casse degli enti locali li costringer molto probabilemente a tagliare proprio sul fronte dei servizi e delle prestazioni senza dimenticare che rispuntato il rischio di un ritorno del ticket sanitario insomma la card per i poveri di tremonti fa pensare ad una politica vecchia e demagogica un provvedimento dal sapore populista lontano anni luce dalle vere esigenze di questo paese

6366080 theres actually no evidence that that is the case at all they have raised the wrong problem in order to push the wrong solution
6366081 the real problem is that our energy mix is not green enough and that we are overdependent as many people now realise because of the crisis in georgia on oil and gas from parts of the world that arent very reliable

6366140 but i think the thing is they realise that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer
6366141 its going to be more relaxed and enjoyable for them
6366142 we got all these anxieties and fears out of the way and now theyre ready for school

6366151 highly opportunistic does not come close to the true value of continental does not create trust and lacks a convincing strategic rationale
6366152 following the hard work over the last weeks continental has come to an acceptable overall concept
6366153 for its costumers continental remains a reliable long term partner that is extremely well positioned the continental employees can continue to rely on the clear focus of our concept for the future which we have developed over the last years
6366154 having new backpacks and the dignity of choice is important to the children for their success when they return to school

6366157 i see more multiple issues with people now it is three four five issues with one of them being my house is in foreclosure thats one of the toughest things we hear
6366158 so many of them are struggling day to day and that one thing just kind of sends them over the edge
6366159 i just reassure them that it is a difficult step so many people are embarrassed to do it but they are helping their families by doing that
6366160 are you telling me that this is actually more difficult than going through the cancer treatment
6366161 if they have a favorite character favorite color well even go into our reserve and try to match them up with something thats really special to them

6366163 a lot of people think in this school district that we dont have a lot of need but we do approximately 10 percent of children attending our elementary schools live with families that cant provide the basic school supplies needed for each semester
6366164 if we can help create a level playing field for disadvantaged children as they enter the school year there are multiple positive results from that
6366165 it boosts their self esteem but from a more practical standpoint it gives them the tools that they need to continue their educations successfully

6366168 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6366169 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the mou which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6366170 there is one stumbling issue which we have been grappling with the framework of the power and roles of the president and the new position of prime minister for the duration of the transition leading up to 2 1 2 years
6366171 the true reason will be that it will kill everything some of the them have worked for their whole lives
6366172 then in the next election some of them will be gone if that happens there goes the democratic party in center township
6366173 if you do that youre not worthy of your jobs
6366174 the ability to expand the curriculum is limited by both enrollment and economic factors
6366175 it is the administrations belief that the merged district will provide programs for students that would otherwise be impossible
6366176 simply said we believe that we can accomplish more together than any one district can accomplish apart

6366187 but when im a senior is anyone going to make anything for me

6366195 theyre going to push us all together and think its going to go well and its not going to happen
6366196 i think theyre just going to play the center kids and not the monaca kids
6366197 i was born in monaca and have gone to school there my whole life
6366198 now were going to have new teachers and theyre not going to know you in monaca everybody knows you
6366199 everyone goes to the football game every friday it just wont be that exciting at a new school
6366200 i think if were winning it will all be fine
6366201 should have more functions to try to get the monaca kids and the center kids to communicate
6366202 you need to have the 2010 11 seniors more involved

6366265 i cannot comment of the decision given by the high court it is not the jurisdiction of the high court to debar or cancel the license of a lawyer only the bar council of india can take a decision in the matter
6366266 the matter the lawyers trying to bribe the key witness is pending before the bar council and it will give a decision in the next hearing
6366267 this jurisdiction vests with the bar council of india generally the bar takes cognizance of the conduct or misconduct of lawyer in accordance with the advocate act and the bar council of indias rule
6366268 a constitutional bench of the supreme court has given the power to debar or cancel the license of a lawyer to the bar council of india but what is peculiar is that so much time has passed but the bar has not taken any decision in this regard
6366269 moreover the punishment of debarring the lawyers from practice for four months and a fine of rs 2 000 is highly inadequate the reputation of the lawyers have taken a beating after the expose and a stringent punishment is called for the guilty
6366270 the expose is an aberration the role of legal profession has not taken any beating as right from the freedom struggle to the current cabinet the lawyers are contributing largely in the public life

6366280 last year was tough on me i still loved playing the game and i was still excited to go to practice

6366282 theyll make us younger and deeper and give us versatility said aces coach keith mccambridge
6366283 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6366284 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6366285 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6366286 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6366287 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6366288 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6366289 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6366290 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6366291 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6366292 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6366293 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6366294 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6366295 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6366296 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6366297 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6366298 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6366299 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6366300 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6366301 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it

6366313 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6366314 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6366315 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6366316 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6366317 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6366318 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6366319 doing these things at night is the last time when anybody would want to do it because there are safety issues and so on but there are also issues of animal welfare
6366320 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6366321 the animal is suffering from previous shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6366322 he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learned to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
6366323 all we have to do is get it out to sea nurse it out there and guard and wait for pod of whales let the whales figure out if they can accept it a mother may think it can feed two
6366324 i gave him a pat like a dog i told him we were going to help him he felt comforted and good
6366325 but that could be dangerous for the whale because if it doesnt find a lactating female its just out there on its own and theres all sorts of sharks out there
6366326 the thing thats coming home to us is whatever reason that caused the mother to abandon it may be the same reason causing other pods to reject it
6366327 until then the advice we have is that unless something miraculous happens like the mother whale turning up its looking bleak
6366328 the first thing you have to do is forget everything youve learned in the cfa training
6366329 the troughton era presented many a feminist role in the supporting cast yet the companions of the time were some of the most notable screamers in the series history

6366337 in the next 6 12 months facebook is developing the ability for advertisers to throttle usage and engagement in areas they care about marketers will be able to pay to accelerate usage they find valuabel to dial up and down actions that people take on applications as part of the social ads program for instance news feed uses an algorithm to communicate a users actions to the friends who would find it most interesting marketers will be able to pay for increased or enhanced distribution above and beyond what news feed already provides

6366363 i was spying on my guys neighbors who were skinny dipping in their pool when he came into the room and caught me
6366364 i think for the consumer it is helpful to know that the hospital they trust is doing the right thing for them
6366365 they were already on their deathbeds when they were admitted from a variety of other health problems
6366366 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6366367 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6366368 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6366369 id like to say on behalf of the people of india that we wish her well and our prayers are with her

6366382 while we review the potential for the idmf to be re launched in 2010 we believe that the short term interests of the market and our customers will be best served by incorporating both the idmf and ecdm exhibitors into our current events for 2009
6366383 we have a long and successful pedigree in this sector with our marketing strength our data assets and our media amp association relationships the needs of the market and our customers will be better catered for by extending our existing events in this way
6366384 en los primeros meses despu s de una accidente se anulan muchos billetes de avi n
6366385 una sensaci n de ansiedad profunda palpitaciones y pensamiento obsesivo respecto a que un d a puedan tener un accidente
6366386 en la carretera muere much sima m s gente que en la aviaci n
6366387 todo el que tenga miedo debe reflexionar y pensar que este accidente de avi n es una desgracia y una tragedia que hay que asumir como todas las cosas que ocurren por accidente
6366388 hay que intentar de evitar en la medida de lo posible tener un acceso de p nico
6366389 pasa con informaci n y con apoyo de la familia y el profesional
6366390 en un accidente de este tipo lo primero que todo el mundo tiene que tratar de hacer es imponerse el orden en el pensamiento y tener la cabeza fr a
6366391 tanto las fuerzas de seguridad como los bomberos las ambulancias los usuarios las autoridades portuarias como el que esta en su casa y cree que un familiar va en el avi n todo el mundo tiene que imponerse un orden
6366392 absolutely we were last in the world in kickoff returns were emphasizing that
6366393 i dont know that we ever put all of the blocks together that you need to spring one
6366394 its probably a reminder of how good the guy was before
6366395 its not just the returners although thats all that most people ever see
6366396 we need to tighten up we obviously know our numbers have been down and we want to improve on that
6366397 last year we didnt play as well as we could our blocking and other things we could have done better on kickoff returns and things like that so hes stressing those right now
6366398 the thought behind what were doing is to honor and inspire women and to make sure that people who are diagnosed with having breast cancer are aware of the options out there beyond what they might have been told and to manage their own disease so they can do whatever they can to cure it
6366399 when they learn they have the disease and theres a 50 percent chance they might not make it its a terrifying thing for women
6366400 its a helluva job for marie because every one of those women is deserving
6366401 we are interested in their story of survival and how they did it
6366402 its a new technology machine that is not invasive and can detect cancer early
6366403 if arlenes cancer had been detected early wed have been able to take steps to combat it instead of having it sneak up on us
6366404 the problem is that when you take all these radiation and chemotherapy treatments and allow the body to be inflicted with something else you reduce the immune system

6366407 she thought i would be interested in the label it was kind of a neat name
6366408 we didnt change the name because well it fit with what we were doing and it was a name most people could remember
6366409 denmark were better than us in the first half but we reacted well and ended up playing a good game against high level opposition
6366410 we have to recognise that if it hadnt been for defender carles puyol and goalkeeper iker casillas we would have conceded at least one goal but the players confidence and skill allowed us to overcome the poor start and win the game
6366411 weve got two world cup qualifiers coming up and we have to get things right because we cant afford to make any mistakes we are the favourites to win but we cant slip up especially when we play at home
6366412 this system worked at the european championship with the players we have in the team we need to keep playing the same way and it worked against denmark especially in the second half
6366413 there are a lot of young players in this team and we havent fulfilled our potential yet
6366414 we want to continue the same progress we made at euro 2008 and with del bosque it looks as though we are going to maintain the momentum

6366416 the italian coachs ludicrous claims that his england side are a match for euro 2008 champions spain were exposed for the hollow irrelevance they were
6366417 last night england were shapeless aimless and hopeless tactically chaotic and technically stunted a mess from start to finish
6366418 if the smell of blood on the carpet at fa headquarters soho square this morning is familiar so too last night was the stale odour of an england performance that carried more than a whiff of the dregs of the steve mcclaren era

6366485 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk accidentally it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken one hundred years to get from the balustrade to the house so were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden

6366488 estamos frente a la bancarrota del sindicalismo tradicional en chile
6366489 la imagen que m s fuerza me provoca es la coherencia que siempre sostuvo entre el discurso y la pr ctica el hecho de poder constatar que hay sujetos en la historia del pa s que se han entregado a la lucha por los intereses de los m s postergados es decir los trabajadores con una pr ctica congruente y una fuerte dosis de autoridad moral el hecho de colocarse ante la existencia de aspectos que trascienden a la simple coyuntura eso me llam profundamente la atenci n y hablo de trascendente no en un sentido idealista de la sociedad y la historia sino con aquella mirada que considera a los hombres y mujeres en los campos del conocimiento las ciencias el arte la pol tica esto para m es relevante toda vez que hoy estamos carentes de personalidades que le den a su vida un valor superior respecto de las cosas estrictamente materiales
6366490 yo era muy joven cuando conoc a clotario como estudiante y como muchacho clotario siempre estuvo dispuesto a apoyar aquellas expresiones estudiantiles y a los j venes trabajadores que estaban no vinculados a las formas tradicionales de hacer pol tica o a los partidos tradicionales siempre clotario goz de un reconocimiento efectivo de aquellos comprometidos con las transformaciones sociales aut nticas y con la lucha extra amente tambi n tuvo una animadversi n hacia aquellos sectores ligados a los partidos en especial a los partidos estalinistas en este marco se gener mi conocimiento a la figura de clotario como un joven conocido m s para l uno mira a los grandes personajes de la historia y procura emular algunas conductas clotario es una de esas personalidades importantes que dan luz sobre aspectos oscuros que la sociedad chilena transita hoy y que se observan cuando se escucha a ciertos dirigentes pol ticos que todo lo hacen en funci n de la negociaci n del objetivo pol tico coyuntural olvidando siempre a los m s postergados es decir a los seres humanos
6366491 hay una enorme inspiraci n que proviene de luis emilio recabarren para m es la figura m s importante del pensamiento pol tico social de los trabajadores chilenos a n no existe otra persona que pueda superarlo en consecuencia tica e incluso en el campo de la educaci n de los asalariados recabarren fue el gran profesor de los trabajadores y sindicalistas chilenos y explor much simas disciplinas en los amaneceres del siglo xx cre un peri dico desarroll el teatro la formaci n permanente desgraciadamente la historia se ha encargado de ocultar su nombre peligroso para los poderosos porque tras l hay toda una vivencia una propuesta una doctrina que deber a ser asumida por los trabajadores pero que lamentablemente es repetida s lo formalmente recabarren y clotario son las dos figuras emblem ticas del movimiento obrero chileno
6366492 actualmente existe muy poca vinculaci n entre las aspiraciones de los trabajadores por mejorar sus condiciones materiales respecto del escenario en el que lo hacen
6366493 tenemos a una enorme cantidad de chilenos que no son personas humanas se puede ser ciudadano en un estado dominado fuertemente por el consumo por un sistema capitalista ultra aqu s lo se puede ser ciudadano si se es sujeto de cr dito es decir un sujeto capaz de adquirir bienes y servicios a trav s de un salario estable en tiempos donde reina la flexibilidad laboral y superior a los 300 mil pesos mensuales 600 d lares que corresponde pr cticamente a un 30 de los trabajadores chilenos bajo este sistema la mayor a est compuesta por sujetos condenados a vivir la marginalidad a reproducir la pobreza en sus hijos a trav s de la educaci n la salud la previsi n social etc y un individuo as es infeliz entonces si la vida es tan precaria y s lo puede ofrecer infelicidad los trabajadores deben dotarse de dirigentes que comprendan este fen meno que lo socialicen que lo discutan que sean capaces tanto de explicar esta infamia como de proponer y practicar la transformaci n profunda de la sociedad y ello se logra por medio de una revoluci n social que coloque en el centro a la persona humana al sujeto que hace posible la riqueza esta discusi n fue planteada hace 150 a os y contin a plenamente vigente
6366494 lo que estamos observando es una destrucci n de las fuerzas productivas una concentraci n cada vez m s grosera del capital y el poder y eso naturalmente est lejos de la democracia lo anterior no ofrece soluciones a los grandes problemas de la humanidad incluso la situaci n es contradictoria a lo que dicen los propios te ricos de la sociedad capitalista a los grandes liberales que combaten el oligopolio el monopolio y promueven la competencia sin embargo en chile vemos una condensaci n econ mica cada vez mayor y la nica forma de revertir el actual estado de cosas es radicalmente de manera revolucionaria innovadora
6366495 eso habla de que estamos viviendo una etapa tr gica el sistema capitalista ni siquiera ha podido garantizar a las sociedades actuales un m nimo decoro las b sicas necesidades fundamentales que en otros per odos se hab an logrado de alguna manera producto de las conquistas de los trabajadores el hecho de que luego de la ltima post guerra mundial el sistema garantizara un elemental r gimen de seguridad social en algunas reas hoy est en tela de juicio el capitalismo para su mantenimiento requiere arrancar todas las conquistas logradas por los trabajadores dejando a fuertes contingentes de asalariados convertidos en mano de obra barata en esta estrategia se encuentra el embate del capital contra los convenios contenidos en la organizaci n internacional del trabajo oit considerando que para algunos durante los 50 del siglo pasado la oit era una mera expresi n de una concepci n tripartita conservadora ahora la oit para el capital es una instituci n contenedora de ciertos derechos y por tanto busca aniquilarla plantea que no se justifica ya porque el capitalismo ha concluido que la relaci n trabajo capital tiene que resolverse bipartitamente es decir el estado y los organismos internacionales deben renunciar a cautelar principios y derechos fundamentales esto explica entre otras variables el bajo porcentaje de la negociaci n colectiva en chile menos de un 9 porque la negociaci n colectiva como se alaba la socialdemocracia y muchos sindicalistas que repet an que el mejor reasignador de recursos era la negociaci n colectiva actualmente est n ocultando este planteamiento porque si la negociaci n colectiva era la mejor forma de reasignar recursos pero hoy pr cticamente no existe qui n reasigna los recursos s lo el mercado entonces ahora la tropa de antiguos pseudo socialistas quedaron desarmados
6366496 el derecho laboral surgi hace casi 150 a os a trav s de grandes juristas franceses italianos europeos que entendieron que la asimetr a entre el capital y el trabajo demandaba la formulaci n jur dica de una concepci n que equiparara al trabajador frente al empleador para negociar esta cuesti n la comprendieron en su momento hasta las miradas m s reaccionarias de la historia y por ello producto de la revoluci n bolchevique y el terror al comunismo la socialdemocracia europea los partidos capitalistas norteamericanos entendieron bien el contexto y generaron reg menes que cautelaron los derechos m nimos de la gente as garantizaron trabajo estable seguros de desempleo decentes salud gratuita y pensi n pero todo ello ahora mismo se est acabando
6366497 la huelga de 30 d as de las trabajadoras y trabajadores del santander banefe fue altamente educativa para quienes participamos en el proceso la ense anza m s grande est ligada a que los trabajadores hicieron su propia experiencia y pudieron sacar conclusiones importantes una de ellas es que la unidad sigue siendo una de las herramientas fundamentales para los intereses de los asalariados esta consigna tan lugar com n fue refrendada por los hechos no es suficiente claro est se requiere tambi n de representantes sindicales honestos dispuestos a dirigir sobre la base y el ejercicio de la m s amplia democracia y potente comunicaci n los conflictos nosotros tuvimos 14 asambleas en un mes de huelga ello genera un buen debate convicci n elevaci n de la moral y limita la incertidumbre que es un arma que suelen usar los empresarios
6366498 el conflicto tambi n revel elementos que no siempre est n presentes en la lucha sindical tradicional si bien el holding santander logr mediante sus poderosos recursos que la huelga y sus razones sufrieran un cerco comunicacional m s que importante afortunadamente nosotros explotamos la veta de la comunicaci n internacional ello signific que muchas organizaciones sindicales internacionales solidarizaran con nuestra lucha y el sistema financiero hoy es vulnerable a este fen meno el negocio de los bancos es la especulaci n entonces los grandes inversionistas al ver un conflicto que comienza a cobrar notoriedad p blica internacional presionan sobre la instituci n financiera en problemas
6366499 el conflicto hay que proporcionarlo pero sin duda fue importante para los trabajadores bancarios chilenos considerando que el grupo santander es el m s grande de iberoam rica para nosotros el hecho nos plantea grandes desaf os y conclusiones nos dice que con unidad convicci n voluntad y comunicaci n permanente es posible comenzar a derribar ciertos mitos basados en el poder o de las grandes corporaciones financieras supuestamente impenetrables por otra parte el conflicto tambi n descubri la certeza de que los trabajadores estamos solos somos la mayor a pero estamos solos de organizaciones sindicales reales una muestra fue la pr cticamente nula solidaridad de la central unitaria de trabajadores cut a pesar de todos los esfuerzos que se hicieron por tratar de comunicarse con la direcci n m xima de la cut para que prestara alg n tipo de apoyo por qu porque las personas que est n en la direcci n de la cut son ignorantes respecto de las nuevas luchas de este pa s y de las nuevas formas de la organizaci n capitalista del trabajo y por otra parte tampoco son capaces de dar cuenta de la realidad de temas tan relevantes como la educaci n en chile por ejemplo lamentablemente la cut hoy representa a sectores minoritarios
6366500 la mayor conmoci n que provoc la huelga de santander banefe y que activ sin buscarla por esos medios la solidaridad internacional fueron los grados de violencia que cobr el conflicto el primer d a fuimos detenidos casi 90 compa eros fue ultrajada una compa era el segundo d a un dirigente nacional fue brutalmente golpeado en el hall del banco durante toda la huelga fuimos seguidos por vigilantes de civil como en los peores tiempos de la dictadura militar ello y m s fue denunciado al gobierno a los parlamentarios a los partidos pol ticos sin embargo de qu nos sirvi cuando hay una complicidad en el hacer y en el silencio de los poderes establecidos y el capital financiero contradictoriamente con lo que podr a pensarse la indiferencia de los representantes del modelo dotaron de una mayor fuerza moral a las trabajadoras y trabajadores en huelga la violencia del capital no nos extra a tanto sino m s bien la pobr sima solidaridad sindical salvando excepciones que recibimos dentro del pa s
6366501 los trabajadores bancarios quedamos en una posici n un poco mejor que antes y adem s el conflicto nos permiti conocer nuestras potencias y limitaciones y una de las fortalezas de la confederaci n es la autonom a y la independencia de clase con las que nos conducimos poco a poco la confederaci n se arma de organizaciones reales de dirigentes que se forman en la lucha y mediante el ejercicio de la democracia y la acci n directa
6366502 la elecci n de la cut es irrelevante no tiene ninguna trascendencia para los trabajadores chilenos a pesar de que existan un par de dirigentes sindicales interesantes que desde hace poco est n tratando desde la cut de instalar un discurso y una pr ctica diferente pero en general lo que hay en la cut es la reproducci n de un ejercicio superado por la historia las elecciones est n organizadas sobre listas que responden a partidos pol ticos que en chile representan una cuota marginal de chilenos hoy es innegable para cualquiera que la gente y sobre todo la juventud no siente ninguna identidad con los partidos tradicionales yo pienso que estamos frente a la bancarrota del sindicalismo tradicional en chile y por eso lo que ocurra en las elecciones de la actual cut no tiene importancia para los intereses genuinos de los trabajadores del pa s lo m s probable es que las cosas queden tal cual est n en las listas hay personas que ni siquiera son dirigentes sindicales
6366503 las necesidades y realidades de los trabajadores transcurren por cauces distintos a las maneras que se expresa y organiza la cut todav a la cut vive en gran medida enfrascada en un modelo de desarrollo existente hasta 1973 pero rest ndole la autoridad moral de los dirigentes de esa poca hoy la cut cay en un pragmatismo exacerbado en el superestructuralismo y es antidemocr tica hasta en la elecci n de sus representantes
6366504 la cut sirve para blanquear las pol ticas del gobierno en t rminos generales funciona como ap ndice del gobierno y por lo tanto puede servir para validar la miseria de ingreso m nimo impuesto a los trabajadores para ello por lo menos siempre tiene prensa
6366505 las relaciones de producci n han variado tanto en chile que la organizaci n de los trabajadores se torna sumamente compleja toda vez por ejemplo que el sector de servicios terciario ha cobrado un vigor notable pero laboran en condiciones extraordinariamente precarias y no cuentan con tradici n de organizaci n hay muchos trabajadores que viven de la parte variable de su salario que son comisionistas trabajadores que se emplean luego de las 6 de la tarde y sus ritmos de funcionamiento son distintos etc todo ello demanda organizaciones diferentes que las tradicionales hoy hay que concentrarse en los trabajadores de los sectores m s dominantes de la econom a servicios comercio telecomunicaciones transporte
6366506 el sindicalismo no puede estar sujeto a los lineamientos jur dicos actuales ordenados por la patronal el sindicalismo desde sus albores ha estado al margen o en los l mites de la legalidad y por tanto ha obligado a que se haga la ley en funci n de sus demandas y luchas y no al rev s las leyes sociales nacieron en el mundo como fruto de las luchas y crecimiento del movimiento sindical organizado las leyes sociales de 1924 ley de la silla protecci n a la maternidad etc fueron consecuencia de las grandes luchas que dio luis emilio recabarren a comienzos del siglo pasado y que obligaron al presidente alessandri a promulgarlas para contener el avance del mundo obrero y por eso en 1931 nace el primer c digo del trabajo no como expresi n de la voluntad de la burgues a de la poca sino como resultado de la lucha de los trabajadores y hoy abrigamos grandes esperanzas toda vez que el promedio de edad de los trabajadores chilenos es mucho menor que el de las actuales dirigencias sindicales

6366629 opera thinks it is acceptable under specific circumstances to release a security update without publishing an advisory for the specific bug
6366630 if we publish without an advisory it is often because other vendors have not issued patches
6366631 publishing a full advisory only because weve patched something could leave users of other products unprotected while giving malicious hackers the information needed to cause damage
6366632 theres definitely a broad consensus among our clients that there may need to be some concessions on saps piece but its also important to understand what value they may receive thats a fair discussion

6366683 there is a need to sign this agreement for the creation of a free trade zone as soon as possible in order to expand trade exchange and investment between the two sides
6366684 this agreement must cover all products and services without any exception and should lead to the creation of joint establishments to increase co operation in intellectual property for this purpose we call on the european side to quickly remove all the obstacles it is imposing on the signing of this vital agreement which will ensure the needed balance in our economic relations

6366698 the recommendation they made to us which weve accepted is that they humanely euthanize the whale tonight provided they can find it

6366713 in the second half we could have done a lot better but it was still a decent result for us we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers
6366714 we have got a game before the croatian one against andorra and it is important we build on our previous games and get the points there
6366715 all the players were really disappointed with not qualifying for the euros it really hurt not to be playing there this summer
6366716 but we will give 110 to try and qualify for the world cup and we needed that sort of test against the czechs going into the qualifiers
6366717 we needed a tough game and i think we got it they were really physical and well organised
6366718 there is more to come but we are always confident we can beat any team if we play at our best and we feel we can get it right in those games ahead
6366719 i had a lot of touches in the first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6366720 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6366721 what people have got to realise as well is it is the early days of the season the lads are still getting fit and sharp
6366722 everyone needs to improve we want to win every game as the other games come along i am sure the lads will be a lot fitter and a lot sharper so we shouldnt have a problem

6366855 ich glaube nicht dass die russen und tschechen sich gegenw rtig auf unterschiedliche seiten der barrikade befinden es ist eher so dass wir st ndig auf unterschiedliche seiten gedr ngt werden doch unsere aufgabe besteht darin das zu verhindern ich pers nlich f hle heute keine von russland ausgehende bedrohung
6366856 f r mich waren die russen ebenfalls opfer des f rchterlichen kommunistischen totalit ren regimes und ich versp re keinen hass gegen sie ich glaube daran dass diese einstellung allm hlich auch unser gesamtes land erfassen wird

6366858 ich verurteilte den georgischen angriff auf s dossetien die morde an zivilisten in diesem gebiet wie auch den massiven einsatz der russischen armee
6366859 die tschechoslowakei hatte damals karpatenrussland nicht angegriffen eine region die w hrend des zweiten weltkriegs zur tschechoslowakei geh rte und nach dem krieg durch einen beschluss der siegerm chte bei der jalta koferenz der udssr angegliedert wurde dubcek war nicht saakaschwili

6366861 the technical teachers training colleges in pakistan and sri lanka were operating below capacity because of insufficient recurrent budgets
6366862 the institutions were operating in isolation from the industries they were designed to serve with few or no links to industry thus lacking essential inputs
6366863 the sfa usually claim they make exchanges in favour of the state without knowing what the woodland would be used for but in this case they have no reason to say that because it had made the order for the creation of new land plots itself which had clear characteristics for ski routes and lifts

6366871 we did not really play well i can only be pleased with the result actually i had hoped that we would control the game better
6366872 we have to raise the bar before our first world cup qualifier against israel on 6 september to achieve a good result there but i have a great team that will improve considerably once everyone has hit their best form
6366873 it would be wrong to get too excited about this win israel will be a much tougher task in world cup qualification
6366874 even though it was 4 1 the swiss squad failed to fully convince it remains doubtful that such a display will be enough when the team is up against a strong israel side on 6 september nevertheless it was a successful debut for ottmar hitzfeld
6366875 we are delighted to receive this recognition and standby our promise of delivering peace of mind for all our customers validations such as this continue to motivate us to go that extra mile in our 25th year of operations we continue to stand committed to our vision of being the best and setting the pace and delivering growth for indian businesses
6366876 ye man its reggae its got the one drop beat of the bass guitar and drums the wo yo yo is just bob marley being creative it is jamaican slang an exclamation a joyful noise the jamaicans make when they laugh at a joke
6366877 in america the red indians used to say the black people resembled buffalos because of their dreadlocks so buffalo soldier dreadlock rasta and the song is about them being stolen from africa brought to america fighting on arrival fighting for survival about 400 years ago
6366878 the other difference is in bar four where the final note goes down to a c in buffalo soldier but up to an e in banana splits in bar eight they both go down
6366879 then it would be a coincidence and coincidences do happen
6366880 it might be that bob marleys producer chris blackwell morphed mainstream sounds from the era into his music to make it more catchy there is no evidence of this its just a conspiracy theory
6366881 there was a watering down from the real authentic reggae which was more drum and basic to a more commercial style which would appeal to the masses

6366920 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them

6366924 he is very small and short for his age where we could we defended him and in some instances spoke to the bullies but we also accepted it as part of life
6366925 we never realised the true impact this emotional and physical abuse had on him
6366926 his words to us were when i put the mask over my face everything went dead quiet and only my body moved i wanted to stop but i couldnt
6366927 firstly we would like to express our sincere sympathy and empathy with the pretorius family we realise that our child has taken away the most valuable possession in your life we are extremely sorry and so wish that these were not the circumstances and that we could change things
6366928 he had gone to school with the intention to make them nobody specific get a fright and to hurt them but he never intended to kill anyone he just wanted to express his frustration and feeling of powerlessness he wanted to be somebody
6366929 to our regret it seems like he had started experimenting with satanism
6366930 we suspect that a combination of factors such as stress a low self esteem wrong influences and an absolute feeling of powerlessness caused our child to commit this terrible deed
6366931 morne was during our visit in detention terribly confused and only realised on tuesday that somebody had died he could basically not remember any of the events
6366932 we appeal to all parents to have a deep conversation with their children to make sure everything is in order we appeal to people not to judge us please give us some time to pick up the pieces of our lives
6366933 it seems that the court is using africa as a test case to determine in what way international law can obtain more legitimacy on the ground in africa
6366934 the icc focuses on economically weak and politically vulnerable countries and on nations that are not able or willing to try perpetrators of crimes against humanity many african countries fulfil these criteria
6366935 we need to ask ourselves whether retribution is a sufficient deterrent to those who violate human rights is intervention by the icc enough to stop crimes against humanity and war crimes in africa and elsewhere in the world
6366936 the court should hold all tyrants accountable but this is not happening so far most of the indictees are african the powerful the united states for instance will never be put on trial
6366937 russia will probably not be tried for what is happening in georgia and the same counts for china
6366938 should we prosecute mugabe despite the possibility this could increase the chance of further deterioration of the situation in zimbabwe or should we give him the chance to walk off if this would contribute a more stabile peace situation
6366939 i am not too much against the former if this will bring peace and stability to zimbabwe
6366940 the icc is not an experiment the court is permanent and is here to stay and does not treat any part of the world as a test case the fact is that africa played an incredible role in the establishment of the court
6366941 the situations the icc is investigating at the moment were put forward by the party states themselves except for darfur which was referred to the icc by the uns security council it is therefore untrue that the court is only targeting africa as the office of the prosecutor has publicly announced that his office is monitoring situations in other parts of the world in colombia for instance and afghanistan
6366942 we are pleased to report that sita suez has seen the error of its ways and has agreed to reinstate the three solidarity members immediately without any blemish on their record

6367002 especially now that were hitting kind of the final stretch everyone wants to race well and move up in the points if we keep running like we are we should hopefully be able to move up

6367009 this is a problem simply because of the way we have treated the environment
6367010 the fact still remains that we do not have sustainable and environmentally friendly systems of sewage disposal in this country
6367011 people could at least dump their chamber pots inside to minimize stench in an environmentally friendly way
6367012 it filters the water retains the solids and allows microorganisms to feed on them
6367013 when water is drained immediately decomposition occurs up to 30 times faster
6367014 the kvip system cannot be cleaned with water because it will compromise the system
6367015 one passion that is driving me is that no school should be without a toilet not one

6367022 you are however reminded that being running mate comes with a lot of sacrifice hard work and inconvenience you must therefore remain committed to the cause stay composed and be a good listener build no barriers and be accessible to all and above all work in tandem with the presidential candidate to promote the party so as to justify the trust and confidence reposed in you

6367033 foreign lawbreakers are being removed from britain at record levels with more than 2 500 deported so far this year
6367034 they were found by a specialist volunteer who helps us clean the statuary in cliveden
6367035 he went to a talk at the local archaeological society given by a snail specialist mentioned his find and it turned out hed spotted the colony which had almost certainly been there since 1896
6367036 it was purchased and brought over from rome by the first viscount astor
6367037 hed been an ambassador in rome and was a great collector the villa borghese in rome which he bought it from now has a copy
6367038 what theyre doing what theyre eating we dont rightly know although its likely theyre feeding on lichen or algae growing on the marble
6367039 but whats important is theyve also been found in two possibly three other places at cliveden so all our eggs are not in one basket from a conservation point of view

6367044 julys robust rise in retail sales should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6367045 we suspect that the official figures are still giving an overly upbeat picture nonetheless there is clearly still a risk that consumer demand remains resilient enough for retailers to try pass on more of their rises in costs to consumers continuing the upward trend in inflation

6367053 if i had children going to st columbas i wouldnt be happy to see the school lose half its playing fields
6367054 this is at a time when we are supposed to be trying to encourage pupils to participate more in sport
6367055 i would like to see the new school located in halbeath which is a community struggling at the moment losing its post office and its local pub
6367056 youngsters are currently bussed to crossgates and having the new school in halbeath would breath new life into the community
6367057 the argument against south fod is that the land is zoned for housing and the council would lose that money but with the housing slump who knows if and when that will happen
6367058 as part of a record investment which will see six new schools for fife we have already committed to building a new dunfermline high school and we are about to consult on a new primary school in the eastern part of dunfermline
6367059 what we want to do now is make sure that the new primary is in the right place takes the weight off schools like masterton and duloch and helps secure the future for other primaries in eastern dunfermline where schools rolls are falling
6367060 if the committee agrees the recommendation then that decision will trigger a 28 day consultation
6367061 an unprecedented number of children of nursery and p1 age have moved into the dunfermline east area and this has put pressure on the existing school
6367062 we have carried out extensive appraisal of a number of options but in order to deliver the school for 2010 the site which currently forms part of the grounds of st columbas is the only viable option
6367063 although we would be losing part of our playing fields we would be gaining an all weather playing area which is very much welcomed by the pe staff
6367064 there are also to be improved changing facilities the playing fields are on a slope and are often waterlogged and cant be used

6367270 the olympics are a special challenge for food producers because athletes demand organic food thats rich in vitamins and minerals and because the olympics food supply is strictly regulated by in country and international olympics committees
6367271 hydroponics allows strict quality control reliable supply environmental benefits and it produces high nutrition crops
6367272 australia wisely chose to rely on hydroponics for its 2000 olympics because soil grown crops could easily have been ruined by adverse weather which is not a problem with hydroponics
6367273 better yet as is the case in north america and europe hydroponics crops cost less to produce and buy than field crops
6367274 the chinese are mastering hydroponics rapidly especially as they produce fruits and vegetables for the 2008 olympics
6367275 in fact the chinese government created a highly regulated guarded organic greenhouse grown plant production infrastructure to guarantee the quantity and quality of the fruit and vegetable supply for olympic athletes and visitors
6367276 fact is organic fruits and vegetables grown hydroponically for the china olympics are packed with vitamins and minerals which means athletes perform better
6367277 and china is able to meet the demands for quality food better than if it was relying on regular soil agriculture healthy organic hydroponics food wins the gold medal at the 2008 china summer olympics in beijing

6367286 the mainline project is critical to ge transportations success in china and presents us with the opportunity to become a long term strategic partner to chinas ministry of railways
6367287 our customer mor sought a product that would significantly improve hauling capability and running speed on the china mainline while at the same time reducing emissions to meet increasingly rigorous chinese environmental requirements
6367288 the locomotive they will receive will meet and exceed those requirements
6367289 this is exciting news for both ge and our partner quishuyan we are three months ahead of the original contract schedule which means the mor will receive the first mainline locomotive early our industrial cooperation with quishuyan shows ges commitment to growing in china and positions us as a lead to replace chinas aging fleet of 6 500 mainline locomotives in the years to come
6367290 we are so glad that the first fully assembled china mainline locomotive has been shipped from ge transportations erie plant
6367291 we wish the china mainline locomotive assembled by ge and qishuyuan in china will have the same high quality as the fully assembled locomotive to arrive soon in china

6367388 we have also made recommendations to ensure that staff are clear about their roles in a work environment that has seen many changes over the past few years
6367389 the incident that triggered this intervention is a real tragedy it follows that the trust should continue to do everything possible to ensure it does not happen again
6367390 we are satisfied that lessons have been learned and the trust is addressing the main concerns by making changes to its systems to reduce the risk of an incident like this being repeated

6367402 thing is some seem to think that they can wear them with just anything and go just anywhere wrong but what i cant stand is when people cant pick their feet up and slide drag clap them on the ground instead of flip flops they become clip clops and there does come a time when they should be replaced like when the sole has gotten paper thin on one side or when your big toe touches the ground
6367403 there is a big difference between wanting a cell phone and needing one imo no child needs a cell phone like i just read in this thread some kid saying its her right to have a cell phone news flash a phone is not a right its a privilege all too many young people have that its my right attitude i would encourage all parents to get pre paid cell phones for their children and let the kids earn the to pay for it before giving it to them if they even want them to have one
6367404 i miss the old paper bags which could be re used for other things they stood up without your food falling out and held up well these flimsy plastic bags are annoying they fall over kill my hands and what a pain in the neck getting rid of them but at least the cats like to play in them

6367424 we welcome and support the tourism related businesses and initiatives that cater to visitors in the city when a new service such as the velib cycling program develops in toronto we encourage them to become part of our industry association so we can promote this new service as a part of the visitor experience in toronto
6367425 whereas all the other programs got subsidized by municipal governments in one way or another
6367426 corporate taxes were 6 3 of low income households tax bills last year compared to just 4 for individual income taxes
6367427 this campaign is directed outside the washington d c beltway
6367428 we think its important to change the way people think about corporate income tax
6367429 one of the drivers of higher living standards is productivity growth and one of the drivers of productivity growth is capital investment in a global economy capital moves around the world where it gets the best return but most workers dont move

6367432 microsoft was forced to release the protocols under european union agreement
6367433 the government in beijing clearly concluded last year that the market was overheated
6367434 certain markets that were particularly overheated have really been very seriously damaged
6367435 they made it a lot tougher for developers of high end properties to finance their deals
6367436 its clearly the government intention i think to drive out of business the smaller less well capitalized property developers
6367437 there was this mindless money going into the sector for someone like hengda its basically just borrow money and try and buy as much land as possible and forget about the price because the stock market will reward anybody with a land bank
6367438 thats the end of the game just about everywhere you cannot borrow endlessly forever
6367439 we stopped working just a few days ago because we want to get paid and that has happened many times in the past five months
6367440 for office space i would now contend we are grossly overbuilt
6367441 its another one of these if you build it they will come except they built too much
6367442 with this agreement the dispute regarding the public takeover offer by the frankish family owned business for the international car parts supplier has been settled
6367443 we think weve come up with a way to end this catfight between internet service providers and peer to peer users
6367444 if you were drunk last night and left it on the kitchen counter because you forgot to put it in the fridge dont eat it because it will already have spoiled even if you cook it
6367445 i hate when youve had on a bra all day long and you just cant wait to take it off every woman has experienced that
6367446 a lot of lingerie tends to leave those marks and be uncomfortable this line is about detail fit and comfort as well as beauty and making women feel sexy

6367453 anybody who wants to come into a place like castleford has to be attracted by the potential
6367454 to not have access to the river or the views was a waste the bridge has brought all that into play you need to make a bold statement the bridge makes that bold statement
6367455 it was seen as part of a package of regeneration it wasnt seen entirely as a transport project
6367456 it is one view of the area that people photograph
6367457 the image of the bridge is a very striking image it is very widely used on publicity photographs and on all sorts of tourist mementoes the bridge is integral it is such a unique design it doesnt look like any other bridge
6367458 the bridge was a landmark of this area and this ancient bridge was very well known all around the world destroying a bridge was a signal of the destroying of our connections and our past to reconstruct the bridge the idea was to reconstruct our connections

6367469 fonzworth bentley tried to make it look like i was just a quitter and i gave up which was not the fact behind it
6367470 he just expected so much more from me he expected so much out of me when i went up there he didnt think that what i was trying to do was trying to show that i was a true gentleman
6367471 if i could change one thing i wouldve never packed my bags and put a ball in the box
6367472 i woulda stayed shut and left it alone thats what i shoulda done
6367473 i felt like i was really missing something in my life
6367474 basically what i was missing was a vision now i have a lot more different goals to go to i found out that i have a gift for gab i can talk to people im a good motivational speaker i direct people in the right way
6367475 those guys on the show helped me go ahead and bring out what im really good at
6367476 im going to start going to school for psychology and maybe ill pick up a career in being a motivational speaker
6367477 i really think that by him staying on the show and winning it might actually open up his eyes a little bit
6367478 before i left i saw the changes i saw what he was trying to do and i saw where he was headed
6367479 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event

6367482 wir machen eine riesenparty mitten in der stadt in der fu g ngerzone
6367483 zum einen mit der band magic of soul wir haben aus sterreich einen ganz bekannten operns nger der auch die ein oder andere arie singt und wir haben auch noch eine berraschung f r den abend
6367484 das geld das wir erwirtschaften wird einem guten zweck zugef hrt das hat die stadt versprochen
6367485 we all had some bad news today our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6367486 an bestimmten standorten kann ich mir beate uhse in der tankstelle durchaus vorstellen
6367487 in zw lf bis 14 monaten starten wir voll durch die konzerne trauen sich halt noch nicht in die ffentlichkeit
6367488 wir fahren dieses mal ein anderes chassis denn mein eigentliches stra enauto wurde bei dem testunfall in kentucky zerst rt
6367489 hoffentlich ist das neue auto genauso gut wie das auto das ich in watkins glen mid ohio und edmonton gefahren bin
6367490 wir mussten das neue auto fertig bekommen und das hat zeit gekostet das ist sehr schade denn es macht den anschein als h tten viele leute bei den tests einigen speed gefunden das wird mir das leben noch schwerer machen
6367491 aber f r gew hnlich lerne ich schnell ein sieg hier w re toll und ich glaube dass dies auch m glich ist ich habe in jedem meiner drei champcar jahre mindestens einmal gewonnen und es w re sch n wenn ich diese serie fortsetzen k nnte

6367499 she gave it to us straight will you leave some tip
6367500 in the end korzenowski and his friends left 20 k on top of their check
6367501 it was not a very comfortable situation to be in
6367502 it should be up to the individual guest to decide whether he or she wants to leave a tip or not charging them automatically would be a rip off
6367503 we leave tips with the waiters and waitresses so that they could make at least some money
6367504 good looking waitresses can make some 30 000 k just from tips each month in this respect a male waiters chances of making big money are somewhat more limited
6367505 we hand over all the tips we collect along with the overall cash and we dont get anything from it
6367506 this money increases employees immediate income but it doesnt get included in social security payments and as a result in future state pension payouts
6367507 we will make several random checks in certain large restaurants with high revenues
6367508 but its quite difficult if not impossible to find evidence of someone getting tips and not paying taxes on them
6367509 the average declared monthly salary in this industry is about 15 000 k but it is misleading
6367510 hopefully signing these agreements will end all the hype that the story has generated and people will come to realize the new geo political situation
6367511 the rockets are not aimed at russia but instead provide cover for our allies who in turn defend us in times of need
6367512 georgia is a handy catalyst that has generated popular support
6367513 we welcome the great advance that has been made between poland and the united states it is clear that the poles feel washington can guarantee their safety and we should not be afraid to follow in their steps and construct the u s military base on our soil
6367514 russia might think its massive military operation against a sovereign state would pass unnoticed it is mainly we czechs with our own experience who should not tolerate something like this
6367515 the georgian attack on south ossetia was politically an absolutely unwise and amateurish step and by this saakashvili has lost the confidence of the democratic thinking world
6367516 the same politicians who did not respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of serbia are now calling on russia to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
6367517 it was an inappropriate reaction from the georgian government an inappropriate reaction from the russian side only followed
6367518 the czech republic supports georgias effort to strengthen its sovereignty
6367519 the biggest problem is not that top officials have different opinions
6367520 however it is highly problematic when they are not able to compare notes and speak with one voice czech foreign policy is a real cacophony of voices
6367521 the government immediately engaged in russia bashing klaus is hitting on georgia
6367522 to hear this from someone who experienced the communist era who knows what it means to live under communist rule is surprising and disappointing
6367523 i agree with his statement that it is important to know who started the conflict but im surprised he doesnt know russia is the side provoking its neighbors
6367524 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
6367525 and the prime minister is not strong enough vis a vis the president to discipline him that is to explain to him that under the constitution it is the government that is responsible for official foreign policy stands
6367526 because the czech republic will take over the eu presidency soon it is important what its position is regarding the georgia conflict
6367527 today its about georgia next its ukraine if russia gets away with this it will go on intimidating its neighbors
6367528 this is not an ethno conflict as its presented by the russians
6367529 this is an occupation of georgia and the conflict did not start a couple days ago but 19 years ago
6367530 we are happy with the way the czech government and the foreign affairs minister expressed their feelings about the conflict on the other hand we are horrified by klaus latest statements and also by the czech communists
6367531 i am listening to the news all the time its horrible my mothers relatives are in gori you know and all their things are now destroyed
6367532 russia wants to show its power it destroys everything and poor ordinary people are suffering for it
6367533 i would suggest klaus go there and see the reality
6367534 the main picture is this georgia is being punished for its western aspirations for not wanting to remain under russian influence
6367535 what i am surprised about is how far russia was willing to go
6367536 sports are something very important even in times of war
6367537 i used the chance and i did not come back
6367538 in our family germany was sort of a dreamland it was the most dramatic moment of my life when i put my foot on german soil
6367539 this was the beginning of the end it was definitely a kind of trigger for me i could not work for a russian newspaper
6367540 not just ethnic minorities or women but anybody who was doing something different
6367541 even today i am trying to work if you have a task you can keep busy you dont think about it as much
6367542 but now nobody in georgia is speaking about his mistakes
6367543 he has a lot of the features of an autocrat but i can forgive some of his mistakes because i can say he has honestly made his country better
6367544 georgia has a chance but todays evidence is proof that a chance is not enough
6367545 you can hardly speak of transparency in that case at all
6367546 a significant emphasis is placed on the openness of the new systems
6367547 the tender was prepared favoring one company their specific technology was mentioned in the bidding document
6367548 when the mission to afghanistan was being discussed in parliament the defense ministry did not show any need to buy new vehicles or any other new technology
6367549 related questions about corruption and nontransparent management of the ministry arise
6367550 if you require an armored vehicle necessary for protection of czech soldiers speed of delivery is the most important factor
6367551 in general i am very worried about the defense ministry misusing exceptions to the tender process
6367552 but i cannot rule out that i could start playing again later
6367553 i dont want to talk about it at the moment
6367554 its clear however that i wouldnt go to the nhl if i were to return i would play with a czech team
6367555 when reaching such a triumph the stanley cup ones motivation naturally lowers
6367556 at the time i simply had a feeling that i would hardly be able to keep a 100 percent focus and so i decided to quit
6367557 above all prague 14 residents should benefit from the possibility of recreation and sport activities at u e ku
6367558 the tower itself is just one small part of the whole project and it should give park visitors good views of the surrounding areas and beyond
6367559 we are a city based zoo and our main customers are czech families with children some of whom visit several times in one year
6367560 for them i think the new tower will be a great benefit it will be located in one of the zoos nicest areas and will hopefully be another good reason to spend time at the zoo
6367561 investors seem to think the problem is generally related to the quality and number of our attractions
6367562 its easier to make investments in this area but the basic problem is not a shortage of sights
6367563 we will certainly hold a discussion about the lowering of interest rates
6367564 the reason is simple we must take care so that the restriction that will hit the whole world due to the slowdown of economies does not lead to our undershooting of the inflation target
6367565 ninety percent of the movement can be explained by the u s dollar on the world market and10 percent of the movement can be explained by the reaction of the czech national bank
6367566 most of my players were at 80 percent of their potential and then we stopped
6367567 because nobody expects us to win so we wont play with any expectations we can just be ballplayers
6367568 travelers should be aware of the reported use of rohypnol and other date rape drugs in the czech republic
6367569 caution should be used when accepting open drinks at bars or clubs
6367570 czech tourism is experiencing the largest crisis since the floods in 2002 and a solution is nowhere to be seen
6367571 maybe if we became a secure country overnight tourists might come back but that is just fiction my own mother does not go to the movies anymore because shed have to return alone after dark such a situation is unacceptable 19 years after the fall of communism
6367572 the czech republic is among the safest countries in the world and even the u
6367573 said hynek jord n spokesman for the regional development ministry
6367574 tourists face the same dangers as they would visiting any other large city at home or in another country and should behave accordingly but there is nothing to be afraid of
6367575 while prague sees more criminality than other czech cities it is safe compared with other large european cities and the situation is improving
6367576 we are in contact with police forces in vienna berlin budapest warsaw and other cities and we can say that while pickpocketing is a large problem in prague the situation is not as bad as it is elsewhere
6367577 this year we have managed to arrest several gangs specializing in pick pocketing
6367578 it should be noted that it is almost solely used by women of disrepute we have no information that bar or restaurant personnel engage in such activities the reporting in u s media is blown out of proportion tourists are not at risk from date rape drugs if they behave responsibly
6367579 fees that to me had no explanation 200 k 12 50 for reissuing a bank card or 50 k for changing your pin
6367580 weve made opinion polls and 66 percent of people said that bank fees are a very important issue
6367581 this is an issue that is somewhat painful for czechs and their politicians should respond to it
6367582 you really dont know how many bank fees you are paying theres no single sum
6367583 the top five banks dominate a large proportion of the market
6367584 while western banks may be less oriented on revenue from transactions they earn more from more sophisticated products like asset and portfolio management
6367585 some of the banks already canceled some of the absurd fees like fees for the cancellation of a clients account or fees for incoming payments
6367586 we saw that the bbf was growing and we found that we were either going to compete or combine
6367587 it was a relatively quick process something that was obvious to both organizations
6367588 in the space of one day we decided on the name
6367589 we prepared the web site and did the legal work over christmas we launched jan 7 and by the end of the month already had 50 members
6367590 local chambers and business organizations have all become very big mixed and serving slightly different purposes theyre attractive to younger members but we need to have an organization for people running those bigger companies if its too big its difficult to keep that going
6367591 who should you do business with who should you not do business with these are good questions and part of why the eba started
6367592 it gave us a way of dealing with a referral system
6367593 now its back to normal i think everyone feels that many associations and chambers can exist in the czech republic quite happily next to each other
6367594 we were a bit concerned that we would lose some members but were quite pleasantly surprised to see that we didnt take a hit above our regular annual changes
6367595 i was surprised by how many people said yes we definitely want that
6367596 employees dont always want to talk to their direct bosses about corporate issues so its a useful thing
6367597 we think weve come up with a way to end this catfight between internet service providers and peer to peer users
6367598 there has been a deterioration in the whales condition over the last couple of hours
6367599 weve decided it is in the best interests of the whale that it is put down
6367600 it is a difficult decision but it is based on the vets advice the rspca and orca groups are in agreeance it be done as soon as possible
6367601 it is communicating with the absurdity of a disneyland somewhere near paris
6367602 to show the foreign spectator that the thinking of a slovak is no longer bounded only with the problems and issues of a local importance but knowingly reflects and reacts to the problems and issues worldwide thus breaking the traditional boundaries of slovak thinking
6367603 we are convinced that engineers on the spot knew about the possible safety risks at least two days in advance
6367604 one of the trolleys used for moving the bridge was bent as early as aug 6 according to photographs provided by local citizens instead of replacing it and taking appropriate safety measures workers only welded an extra support and continued with the reconstruction
6367605 the accused took pictures of the bent trolley and sent them to the prime contractor ods dopravn stavby ostrava that means that everyone involved knew about the safety risk yet failed to take any action
6367606 i want to offer my sympathies to all the victims and their families we wish to diminish their loss by paying compensation even though we are aware that no amount of money can return their loved ones
6367607 we are cooperating fully with police investigators and hope the culprits will be identified as swiftly as possible
6367608 according to our own quick investigation employees of a subcontractor were conducting some preliminary work for sliding the bridge into place later in the day we are convinced that all safety requirements were met
6367609 as far as we knew no construction was scheduled that day had we known we would have decreased the maximum speed to 30 kilometers an hour so the train could have braked in time or we would have stopped services completely and taken passengers by bus
6367610 it is a great loss for us and we all share a deep sense of remorse over this tragic accident we feel responsible for our customers and will do our best to provide everything we can for those affected
6367611 these are limits set by law and we cannot give out more but by accepting them people do not lose the right to fight for more compensation in court
6367612 the engine and several cars that were completely destroyed in the accident had recently been refurbished to provide greater comfort and allow higher traveling speeds we now will have to buy new ones
6367613 this simple structure with its clear functionalist lines is the last standing example of a small utility building designed in connection with brnos road infrastructure
6367614 it was set in this area with a deep sense of city urbanism at the same time it is the only building of this type in brno
6367615 from an architectural point of view the building was designed in the fundamentalist style that flourished between world war i and world war ii
6367616 during that time many buildings of this type were constructed in brno it was a time of architectural experimentation
6367617 everything must be renovated even though its only a small building
6367618 the construction has degraded which might have a negative impact on the status of the building
6367619 hradec kr lov is the city of culture and superb experiences cheb is the modern town with a 1 000 year history kutn hora is the gothic jewel the city of two cathedrals jind ich v hradec is the town of romantic walks litomy l is the modern historical town poli ka is the town of mysterious nights tel is the town of happy loves and t ebo is the city that will heal your body and soul
6367620 also we highlight the main cultural events in each city and organize exclusive exhibits and other events
6367621 after a nice walk through the square here one of the biggest in the czech republic you can relax in the monastery gardens
6367622 not only is litomy l a historical town but it is full of modern architecture by well known architects like josef pleskot and ale burian
6367623 you can be inspired by experiencing some unforgettable moments at musical and theater festivals dances and interesting exhibitions
6367624 we look at young players recommended to us usually by their teachers and competition winners
6367625 in japan they held auditions for the festival this year it was the first time and no one was judged good enough on solo clarinet
6367626 to be honest those concerts are better attended than the ones in prague
6367627 we fill the churches and concert halls in those cities
6367628 the typical response we got when we invited quartets to be in the festival was we love the idea but were not in prague much
6367629 august was the only time of year we could find them all here
6367630 the festival should be intimate in the same way that string quartets are intimate
6367631 next year we may add a couple concerts for string sextets but for now were happy to be small and high quality
6367632 at one of the bertramka concerts there were people in the back row with a baby carriage which meant we had some real local music lovers
6367633 at another one people from the states remarked afterward on the vitality of the playing and the intimacy of the surroundings
6367634 any authentic work of art must start an argument between the artist and his audience
6367635 r amp b from anywhere was the sort of music i gravitated toward as a listener southern r amp b chicago r amp b and philly soul
6367636 i couldnt tell you what saturnalias theme is but theres a seeking of transcendence thats new i have never written songs like this before its a different temple im visiting

6367640 diplomacy was an interesting experience for me and i certainly would be able to do what i do now without my diplomatic background
6367641 as in the diplomatic world you have to travel and you have to meet people its different in many ways of course but as in diplomacy its mostly about the people
6367642 i like to call le patio a cross between a shop and an art gallery
6367643 the basic thing is to have personal taste my shops are very personal shops and my style is all about mixing and matching its a combination of individual pieces coming together
6367644 most of our customers are people who arent conservative people who like to mix styles patterns and colors
6367645 these are people who like to have a different interior in their homes maybe they really like what they see on their trips abroad theyre quite cosmopolitan people actually
6367646 financially distressed real estate projects what lenders need to ask a lawyer
6367647 this is what we call a loan workout a lot of times what happens in a workout is a process a methodology is agreed upon between the lender and the borrower
6367648 we would meet with the client and find a way to turn a nonprofitable real estate investment into a profitable one by restructuring or repositioning it in the market
6367649 i would suggest a meeting with the lender and i would explain why its in the interest of the lender to participate it can be a win win situation
6367650 both the lender and the borrower and the lawyer know far better how to resolve the situation positively than a judge
6367651 the old law was corrupt it wasnt working and basically had nothing to do with other bankruptcy laws in other parts of the world
6367652 in the old days failed businesses would be liquidated and sold off in pieces
6367653 thanks to the new legislation the point now is to keep the business going so no jobs are lost and so the investment is not lost
6367654 generally banks are being more conservative in their lending practices
6367655 theyre rejecting more applications for all loans they did even six months ago theyre applying a harder standard to people who want to borrow money for buying a residence funding a building project or a starting a small business
6367656 instead of another sketchy encounter with contemporary art the exhibition will allow the audience to think more in depth about the development and direction of individual artistic positions

6367673 indoctrination itself is not illegitimate in fact it is an intrinsic part of child rearing out of love and concern parents explicitly or implicitly formulate desired outcomes for the young lives they have created parents generally hope their children will adhere to their own traditions and belief systems which they attempt to inculcate the question parents must face is who will do the indoctrinating schooling is an adjunct to child rearing the schooling options available force parents to make decisions regarding the level of autonomy they wish to exercise they retain the greatest control over their childrens developing beliefs by schooling them at home an alternative is to enroll their children in an institution where they are certain the indoctrination conforms to their own values such as a religious school when parents send a child to a tax funded school they sacrifice their autonomy to alien interests
6367674 i really feel like its where the rubber meets the road
6367675 charlottesville is a unique and wonderful place and could certainly use some planning
6367676 what if you could design your own halo 3 armor permutation what would it be
6367677 it would be frankies mister chief that would be awesome
6367678 a sniper variant something that doesnt stand out like the other perms like if your primary color matches the color of the environment youre on you shouldnt be able to be seen as easily as if you were wearing standard mk vi gear the gold visor needs to barely be visible the chest piece needs to allow the user to have the stock of the sniper rifle held comfortably the shoulders would allow easy mobility curved not too big
6367679 definitely a gigantic optimus prime armor with of course the ability to transform to an awesome truck
6367680 battle trophy armor bits of grunts and jackals hanging from the neck and shoulders scraps of armor and helmets attached to shoulder pads marine dog tags and somehow it would still look right with all the colors maybe a chain of bullets wrapped around the chest yeah thatd look cool
6367681 a dinosaur armour rawr so fun running round chasing them
6367682 i knew someone was going to say something about the schedule
6367683 ive been in this league nine years and im still waiting for the easy games i cant find them
6367684 with us its a week by week thing every week is a whole new season
6367685 sean said marty just dont put me in a situation where i cant honestly tell the kids they have a chance to win the game
6367686 youve got to go into every game thinking youre going to be in it until the end new teams new faces new players whatever its a new challenge thats what were looking forward to
6367687 you wake up and have some inflammation thats basically what it is
6367688 if hes not ready we wont pitch him well back him up another couple days
6367689 thats the way it goes i dont think that is going to happen but if it did we would back him up and i told him that
6367690 well pitch him when hes ready to pitch and not because his day comes up
6367691 the point is that beckett is really wanting to throw and thats always a good sign
6367692 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6367693 i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6367694 i lost i dont know what to say my dreams are crushed
6367695 i think with more experience on these top levels as we continue to play against the best teams in the world on a consistent basis thats whats really going to continue to develop this team and this program
6367696 is it real is it real did i really win gold
6367697 its to everyone out there that you have to work hard
6367698 we waited four years for this gold and a whole row of 10s was our crowning achievement
6367699 one of my colleagues used to work for a company that decided it needed to downsize the company took the bizarre step of announcing who would be laid off in stages with each announcement coming on a friday the 13th
6367700 this creates fear and tension among employees and also creates an us vs them mentality there werent any disasters on that occasion but its not hard to imagine tensions boiling over
6367701 if you need to lay this type of person off its important to be very explicit about why they were chosen and why this was a logical decision
6367702 if its because of economic reasons be very clear that its because of economic reasons
6367703 otherwise the tendency to believe theyre out to get me often takes over
6367704 one of the worst things you can do is create ambiguity
6367705 while the managers might think they are sparing feelings they are also giving ex employees an opportunity to spin conspiracy theories which fuel anger and resentment
6367706 be kind and respectful but also as candid as possible
6367707 a big problem with these reactions is that they dont always go away once the stress is reduced
6367708 people become addicted to alcohol or irreparably harm their reputation at work or their relationships with family members
6367709 fortunately the really dramatic stress related incidents like workplace shootings are rare
6367710 reducing bad stress often can be done by reducing bureaucracy and listening to employees concerns to see if they can be addressed
6367711 what you generally dont want to do is try to reduce employees overall stress levels by taking away the good stress the aspects of a job they find enjoyable and energizing
6367712 we felt it was helpful and important to plan a meeting in the seacoast
6367713 i really do appreciate your efforts to understand the needs of the working family in new hampshire

6367715 basically i was trying to get her to lie down while we ate dinner
6367716 i got involved just because i brought my dog to be trained
6367717 but then i loved it so much i wanted to do more
6367718 for a lot of people its kind of their outlet with their dogs from the everyday world
6367719 six weeks of training is not going to be all someone wants to do
6367720 usually they do at least two sessions and a lot of people get hooked
6367721 its more like play and exposing them to different kinds of environments and socialization
6367722 dogs really enjoy it no matter what age they are
6367723 i tell people you want a dog that makes you happy without making other people unhappy
6367724 they naturally will jump up and bark we teach them to become good citizens and good members of the family
6367725 builds that basic relationship between a person and their dog
6367726 its a lot easier to make a puppy lie down than it is a 60 to 80 pound dog
6367727 we have a lot of dogs that come to us when theyre teenagers around seven to eight months old
6367728 thats when the dogs start showing their independence when puppies are little they stay closer to you but as they get older they start wandering
6367729 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything

6367738 i love bags i am definitely a bagaholic big time this one i got at a boutique in kennebunkport and i love it to death
6367739 not really a bagaholic but i love my tommy hilfiger its functional and goes with most of my clothes my mom calls it my mary poppins bag because it holds so much stuff and she never knows what im going to pull out of it
6367740 yes yes i am a bagaholic a real bag lady i love black and white and my white is great with black its a liz claiborne and i just love it i love most bags

6367746 one of my jobs is to help save first in the nation status of the new hampshire primary
6367747 a proposal to establish a special commission to recommend changes to the democratic partys rules for delegate selection and presidential primary timing for future presidential cycles

6367749 particular year has been special and we wouldnt miss this convention for the world

6367753 you plug it right into to a 110 volt receptacle like a lamp
6367754 it was due for replacements and we wanted to get something that would fit in with the citys sustainability efforts
6367755 the purchase is one more step in the city of portsmouths efforts to become a more sustainable community and it will save our citizens money
6367756 when we joined the cities for climate protection campaign two years ago we pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from both the city operations and throughout the community this truck represents just one of our many efforts

6367780 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time

6367799 voltaire solutions are powering both the worlds fastest supercomputer on the top500 list and the worlds most energy efficient supercomputer on the green500 list demonstrating that performance does not come at the expense of efficiency
6367800 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest
6367801 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
6367802 obama would rather lose the war in iraq in order to win an election

6367808 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind

6367810 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6367811 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6367812 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record

6367902 today marks the end of an era for thousands of young people and the beginning of a new world of opportunities as people take up employment embark on the next stage of their academic studies or move on to vocational training
6367903 all young people receiving their grades should be proud of all the hard work that they have put in and congratulated for their results congratulations must also go to teachers and parents without whom the achievements of our students would not have been possible while results are important school is only a gateway to further development everyone has unique talents and regardless of whether or not a young person has done well academically we should be encouraging students to take a breath reflect on what they have achieved so far and give due consideration to their next steps
6367904 we have not right to sit silently by while the inevitable seeds are sown for a harvest of disaster to our children black and white
6367905 by every civilized and peaceful method we must strive for the rights which the world accords to men clinging unwaveringly to those great words which the sons of the fathers would fain forget
6367906 selling a lot of beach outdoor equipment toys and stocking stuffers
6367907 because everyday is a new day and because kids rule thats our motto
6367908 of course there is always a caveat to destiny and thats obligation the greatest obstacle to destiny is debt both personal and financial the more people you are obligated to the harder it is to focus on yourself and figure things out
6367909 its a beautiful day and i am sure you werent thinking of the implications of speed slow down and be more aware of life
6367910 sometimes you get a big one hooked and he breaks the line but most of the time you can land the small ones
6367911 you mentioned walleye my favorite fish from lake erie when i was growing up in toledo ohio
6367912 i know the beauty of eastern manitoba and it painted a stunning memory of my time there a good thing on a dull cold elliot lake day

6367914 we have been taught that even if we screw up in life to hide it
6367915 inflation fears are back on top of worries surrounding the fate of freddie mac and fannie mae fears of additional writedowns etc etc people are getting nervous again
6367916 we view recent gains in the u s dollar as sustainable
6367917 against the backdrop of housing market related concerns worsening growth expectations outside the u s the outlook for yields soft commodity prices and strong capital flows are all dollar supportive
6367918 the town currently has no protection against large extractions at the regional or state level
6367919 a reasonable ordinance will take time to craft this will give us time this is not an anti water district vote its an attempt to protect the town
6367920 testing pumping and transport of wells groundwater surface water aquifers springs and well water
6367921 transportation through wells of water that has been pumped for other locations
6367922 were concerned the moratorium would limit our ability to look for ground water in 2007 the state passed significant regulations branch brook is not going to dry up and were not going to hurt it with this
6367923 we want to allow the citizens to decide if they want to allow a high impact business in town
6367924 we would like the moratorium to protect not just the water districts land but that of private citizens were not attacking poland spring or the water district
6367925 there are thousands of acres around the aquifer that are not permanently protected
6367926 this revenue would allow the water district to buy up the acreage what if a business bought this up an industrial accident caused a toxic spill the aquifer could be ruined
6367927 i had experience some years back of going through board of environmental protection and department of environmental protection hearings
6367928 if anyone thinks your rights are protected by the bep dep or public utilities commission i have several bridges i want to sell you i think people should look at the resources in town and protect them to say the state is going to protect you good luck
6367929 whats alleged is pretty serious flashing a knife at a child
6367930 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6367931 its a tremendous project and its going to freshen the property
6367932 you can sit down and talk to someone but if youve never gone through what a soldiers done its hard to get them to understand where they are coming from
6367933 it was real nice of him to think of taking a couple of people out with him
6367934 honestly were the forgotten soldiers they always remember those who died and those who are fighting but there is a group of people who are not in those categories it puts us in a dead mans place
6367935 hopefully next year they can expand and get even more guys down here on the boat
6367936 it worked out fantastic seemed like the guys had a great time it sure made me feel good
6367937 we are starting small but we plan to build on it each year and hopefully one year be 100 percent green
6367938 i dont think it was a question of why doesnt the seafood festival recycle
6367939 its more like why doesnt hampton beach recycle by doing this we are hoping others will follow in our footsteps and start to recycle
6367940 the last time we did it people were just throwing their trash in the recycling containers
6367941 this time around we wanted to make everyone more aware on why they are there
6367942 we decided to pick the biggest item that we can recycle which was plastic bottles and start there
6367943 each year we add something else and eventually the goal is to have the seafood festival a completely recycled event
6367944 its an investment for us to do this but its well worth it
6367945 we will also have a recycling education tent signs and regular announcements during the festival
6367946 we cant police every trash can but we can get the word out there
6367947 i think that just strengthened our commitment to go green and stay clean
6367948 we teach kids to be less focused on themselves and more on the community
6367949 they spend a couple hours each week on the project the kids are learning leadership skills
6367950 we decided to exist to equip kids to think live and bring about change in a culture that says kids are going backward not forward
6367951 in doing my masters thesis i found that what makes a difference in a kids life is an adult whos truly involved we are deeply involved in their lives in discipling and mentoring them
6367952 we wanted to form a school where kate would both know others and be known in deeper life changing ways and be challenged in every part of her life
6367953 three teachers with 12 kids is a great ratio its challenging academically but also personally and spiritually its not for every kid
6367954 were preparing them for college in intense ways and theres also a decidedly spiritual component its the education you dream about for your kid a partnering of school with the home
6367955 they taught the kids how to fundraise how to write a fundraising letter how to make a call how to run an event make a budget and develop a profit and loss statement
6367956 they were an energetic group very focused on what they were doing
6367957 we had a conversation with nancy parsons and rosemary moore and talked about how the project would fit the needs of the council we came up with the baby bag project it was a wonderful experience for the council and the kids from veritas they got an up close look at the workings of a nonprofit
6367958 its wonderful for the council to have an opportunity to expose future leaders to community service and citizenship
6367959 it teaches them as kids to support those kinds of community activities
6367960 the tuition is 4 200 per year but well work with parents and kids if they cant afford that
6367961 distinguished civic or conservation work making permanent improvement for public benefit e
6367962 it really is a nod to a lot of effort and a lot of people
6367963 i embrace the meaning of this park and what it stands for all of us in the community
6367964 you should have a look at those words and the flags it gives me goose bumps to this day
6367965 ive been seeing people reading books or just taking walks through there
6367966 hdnl says they delivered to a lady in the gallery next to the library at 20 25 on the 9th october
6367967 the road map to peace only moves in one direction and that direction is from the west bank to the mediterranean sea the only thing in the way is israel
6367968 admire for the environment and major pleasure can be compatible
6367969 what gets lost here is that the supporters of the age 21 law and opponents have the same goal we are all about stopping abusive behavior
6367970 were not talking about going from abstinence to animal house
6367971 lowering the legal drinking age would stop a lot of them from getting arrested and a lot of them drink anyways
6367972 just because you can shoot a gun and go to war doesnt mean you should be able to get drunk
6367973 we want what is best for the students because we are trying to not have an impact on the education of the students and continue high standards of education
6367974 if the founding principle of this rsu committee is keeping a school open then lets put some teeth behind the principle
6367975 im not sure including this would float with the kennebunk taxpayers
6367976 it has been a disappointing start and we need to kickstart the season for me that started on monday when we got on the training pitch and looked at the things that have cost us and goes straight through to our next game on saturday
6367977 we had a good look at the video on monday we gifted them three goals in the first half and you cannot do that at this level that was down to a bit of a defender cohesion if you like but as a team we didnt defend properly
6367978 we have been okay in all three games but defensively it has cost us we have not had a problem in front of goal but we have got to keep clean sheets we will never do anything otherwise
6367979 i told them at half time at mansfield show me what your about in the second half and we showed tremendous character thereafter it was much more like what i am after and much more like what we should be about
6367980 stuarts done photography for us for 20 years his photos adorn the walls of our offices hes made such a difference blakes a relative newcomer but hes become another angel he videotapes everything for us
6367981 they both are among the nicest people you can meet
6367982 its a great honor to be acknowledged by the portland ballet
6367983 my involvement is one of great respect appreciation and love
6367984 one of the things that impresses me about the ballet and got me involved is their attitude toward education and the wellbeing of their students
6367985 thats the most important thing in a competitive society they are one example of sanity and proper values
6367986 it started with my wife taking lessons there she mentioned to them that i had a then hobby of videography ive now turned that into a retirement business i owe a lot of that to the portland ballet ive been getting just as much as i give in the work i do for them
6367987 in the past the award has been a beautiful framed and signed photo by stuart
6367988 we thought that wouldnt be appropriate this year so this year well be giving a painting by jan roberson each recipient will receive a painting by her a signed framed work of art
6367989 the stay is important because it keeps me on the ballot
6367990 even if the maine court acts and grants the stay the likelihood is that we cannot depend on them to maintain the stay until the ballots are printed were protecting ourselves by going to the u s supreme court
6367991 if its approved we then file a writ of certiorari asking for a hearing on the constitutional issues
6367992 were modestly confident they will agree to hear the case
6367993 if you need a jolt of summer memories to sustain you through the long winter this video captures those moments and sounds
6367994 the photography is stunning particularly the ocean breaking on the rocks below and the wide vistas of the marginal way and beach beyond all enhanced by a beautiful sound track
6367995 they gave me a list and i interviewed 15 people
6367996 everybodys emotional connection to the marginal way moved me closer to understanding what formed the soul of ogunquit i was taken aback by so many little stories a lot of community involvement and concern
6367997 this isnt good enough and stressing that i needed the item for this weekend and that i didnt authorise the item to be left with a neighbour or a safe place amazon have kept quiet
6367998 shows that animals have these precursors to math very early on in the evolutionary line and early on in development
6367999 if you have an animal trying to make a decision to defend its territory its going to want know how many other animals it has to deal with
6368000 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6368001 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6368002 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6368003 i made it clear to him and everybody else i never worked for anybody in my life
6368004 i got here when i was 29 i never had a boss i dont know how id handle it
6368005 i not only felt i was blindsided by what was taking place but this board was acting not so much like a judge and jury but to me more like a kangaroo court
6368006 the actions of this board in looking to satisfy the concerns of the fire personnel on some comments i made at a brush fire at my residence have now become completely political in nature and represent little more than character assassination
6368007 in summary one need not be an attorney educated in the law to know that robert j higgins was unquestionably deprived of the fundamental rights of all citizens to due processof the law
6368008 i think that we have an obligation as citizens in our town that we treat each other with decency
6368009 just in amazement that theres monkeys running around on that island right there
6368010 we do not therefore contemplate him outside ourselves from afar in order that his righteousness may be imputed to us but because we put on christ and are engrafted into his body nb this makes justification an ecclesial doctrine in short because he deigns to make us one with him
6368011 to trick or force sb into doing sth that they do not really want to do
6368012 austere subdued and restrained are some of the english words that come closest etymologically shibui means astringent and is used to describe a profound unassuming and quiet feeling
6368013 painting is stronger than me it makes me do things i normally wouldnt do
6368014 i have done things i know that i cannot do
6368015 then i requested for a karaoke machine where i could practice my singing and o far its all 100 his score since then
6368016 oh the infinitely delicate tender and loving quality of that relationship
6368017 in your book the painters keys you suggest untempered masonite as a support its now getting hard to find and the edges tend to break down im considering switching from canvas to wood panel what are your thoughts about the so called door skin
6368018 a man is his own easiest dupe for what he wishes to be true he generally believes to be true
6368019 there needs to be a substantial improvement in our performance at the breakdowns
6368020 we have put a lot of emphasis on winning the collisions which requires incredible accuracy with the arrival of our support runners and cleaners
6368021 we are anticipating that smith and waugh will play which could put us under more pressure at the breakdowns
6368022 but it is important that the referee also plays his role by preventing any side entry and ensuring that if the opposition players contest the ball they are on their feet and that it is legal the breakdowns have been a concern for us partly because of our inaccuracies and the policing of this area
6368023 they australia are good from the set phases and have a very good lineout particularly with lock dan vickerman back
6368024 so we have to secure first phase possession which we have been doing we must also get the ball through the phases which we havent been doing well we have been breaking down horribly in the third and fourth phases in the last few games so we have to pay a lot of attention to retaining the ball
6368025 but that said we had a tough day in perth against the aussies a few weeks ago they have a credible scrum so we will respect them at scrum time it is definitely not an easy contest against their pack
6368026 daar zitten we met 438 000 werklozen nu al onder
6368027 dan is er sprake van een gezond evenwicht tussen vraag naar en aanbod van arbeid
6368028 maar er bestaat nu al krapte in behoorlijk wat sectoren we denken dat die lijn in 2007 en 2008 wordt voortgezet
6368029 we zullen weer snel in een situatie komen waarin vacatures moeilijker zijn te vervullen
6368030 we hopen dat de werknemer er ook wat van heeft geleerd opleiding en het soort werk waarop je inzetbaar bent zijn ook belangrijk salaris is niet meer van doorslaggevend belang
6368031 het beeld klopt dat er weer bordjes op de deuren hangen met personeel gevraagd wij verwachten niet dat de situatie voor de zomer nijpend wordt het is moeilijk te voorspellen hoe het later dit jaar zal worden maar het is wel duidelijk dat we op een keerpunt zitten
6368032 wij zijn er in 2004 mee begonnen omdat toen de wet werk en bijstand werd ingevoerd
6368033 ik vind dat de burgers daar niet aan mee moeten betalen omdat ik dat vind moest het aantal bijstand suitkeringen naar beneden vandaar dat wij met die projecten zijn begonnen het hebben van een uitkering is een recht maar die mensen hebben ook plichten
6368034 natuurlijk is het achteraf makkelijk praten als het een succes blijkt te zijn het had ook slechter uit kunnen pakken
6368035 wij vinden ook dat mensen pas mee mogen doen als zij de boel op orde hebben daar zorgen wij eerst voor

6368037 io dice qualcuno non sono razzista e vorrei aiutare tutti ma
6368038 if you want to see reasoned analysis at its best you have to read the paragraph farmer
6368039 my friend patrick ohannigan shows why he is the jimi hendrix of pundits
6368040 frankly i think patrick ohannigan ought to be out there making a bazillion dollars from his writing
6368041 do not dwell in the past do not dream of the future concentrate the mind on the present moment
6368042 success is often achieved by those who dont know that failure is inevitable
6368043 this is also a great description of total right brain painting
6368044 i sometimes go through something very much the opposite when i do exceptionally well on a piece i worry i cant top it and become hesitant to do more work
6368045 i painted in a free creative frenzy for 12 years then began to have expectations so unrealistic that they doomed me to failure what began as perfectionist drive destroyed me as a painter and i put my brushes away my disappointment in myself was too great to bear i now make photographs which are immediate and my failures are simply deleted
6368046 failure is always hurtful humiliating and embarrassing but its the price to pay for daring to get what we want out of life
6368047 the minute you finish a piece get rid of it if its bad itll drag you down if its great youll just sit there looking at it
6368048 painters are not in any way unsociable through pride but either because they find few pursuits equal to painting or in order not to corrupt themselves with conversation and so debase the imaginings in which they are absorbed
6368049 id like to coach and teach id like to get my masters maybe even start a beach program but a lot of women have had children and rush to get back but id like to spend time and see the child grow
6368050 we want to go maybe for a third but babies first priorities change
6368051 i think thats what makes this team so good is that we are prepared for absolutely everything
6368052 i would like to see my husband for longer than a day and have a family
6368053 in 2007 i saw treanor for two weeks between february to november the last time i saw him for a couple days was all star break so that was july 17
6368054 the time has come and its going to be exciting to come home and say honey whats for dinner
6368055 i think when kerri and i come back we can do it again
6368056 id like to coach and teach id like to get my masters maybe even start a beach program but a lot of women have had children and rush to get back but id like to spend time and see the child grow
6368057 we want to go maybe for a third but babies first priorities change
6368058 i think thats what makes this team so good is that we are prepared for absolutely everything
6368059 i would like to see my husband for longer than a day and have a family
6368060 in 2007 i saw treanor for two weeks between february to november the last time i saw him for a couple days was all star break so that was july 17
6368061 the time has come and its going to be exciting to come home and say honey whats for dinner
6368062 i think when kerri and i come back we can do it again
6368063 this is just another part of our sisterhood that we want to continue together
6368064 we have to make a team of the future so keep volleyball in the olympic games so our kids can play together
6368065 dand lumina pe care nu o ai o vei avea si tu

6368067 wanneer dat niet verandert blijft het dweilen met de kraan open nieuwe generaties staan elke keer klaar om zich op hun beurt te verliezen in ontspoord gedrag en bovenmatig gebruik van alcohol en drugs
6368068 theres probably growing concern at the faa at the regulators across the world of whether the economic downturn in the aviation industry may be having some effect on maintenance
6368069 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6368070 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6368071 were seeing tremendous growth in video and games among thumbplays customers
6368072 this growth is occurring for two reasons the content is extremely engaging and the mobile experience on a huge range of phones is exceptionally good in terms of content creation player x is as good as it gets and we couldnt be more proud to have them in our ever growing family of incredibly talented partners
6368073 de aantrekkende conjunctuur en de krapper wordende arbeidsmarkt bieden volop kansen er zitten nog 300 000 mensen in de bijstand dit is niet het moment om de helft daarvan als onbemiddelbaar af te schrijven
6368074 er zit veel meer dynamiek in het bestand dan vaak wordt gedacht
6368075 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
6368076 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
6368077 de cli nt is beter af met een baan dan met een uitkering
6368078 we are not going to renew it and that shouldnt come as a surprise to anybody
6368079 het kabinet zal dit in overweging nemen indien de ontwikkelingen op de arbeidsmarkt aangeven dat de te verwachten arbeidsmigratie uit de nieuwe eu lidstaten zodanig van omvang is dat zij in de desbetreffende sectoren de arbeidsmarkt ernstig zal verstoren
6368080 mocht in een bepaalde sector een grote instroom in de ww plaatsvinden die gerelateerd kan worden aan de afgifte van tewerkstellingsvergunningen in de desbetreffende sector dan kan dat een signaal zijn om in de periode tussen 1 mei 2006 en 1 januari 2007 de arbeidsmarkttoets in de desbetreffende sector opnieuw in te voeren
6368081 in the short term there probably wont be many but in the long term we expect to see them for instance a casino or even somewhere you can go and see 18 rated trailers for games
6368082 obviously there are other 18 plus areas that you could imagine but some of those might not come to fruition but we have the ability to age protect areas and i think thats something that we will inevitably make use of
6368083 that isnt anything particularly sinister but obviously youd have to prevent 12 year olds going in there
6368084 take off accidents are very very rare you reach a point in take off when it is unlikely that anything can go wrong but if things do go wrong they can go wrong very quickly
6368085 on take off pilots reach a point of no return known as v1 speed which is usually reached about two seconds before take off
6368086 if you go above v1 and abort the take off there is insufficient room at the end of the runway and there is the chance of going off the end of the runway at a very fast speed and things can then go very badly wrong
6368087 the normal rule is that if you go beyond v1 and something goes wrong you take off anyway if for example a tyre blew you would take off
6368088 a problem at the point of take off is very challenging for the pilot if something happens at the point of v1 he is committed to taking off if there is an engine failure at this point he is flying an aircraft at very low speed
6368089 im very aware of the effect that the announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6368090 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6368091 unficyp estimates as of end 2000 idp population in northern cyprus 45 000 persons idp population in southern cyprus 165 000 persons total idp population 210 000 persons
6368092 today marks the second anniversary of these maine silver star medals being presented to our heroes
6368093 maine veterans throughout history have exemplified a proud tradition of service we have one of the highest rates of veterans in the nation
6368094 growth in terms of value its not horrible but its not as good as it could be
6368095 det finns mycket kvar att g ra inom elektronisk upphandling
6368096 det finns mycket kvar att g ra inom elektronisk upphandling
6368097 its amazing how it has energized our support and our efforts
6368098 we have to keep up that energy and i think they will continue to take notice
6368099 we put it on hold for a bit but decided that it was still important to continue this effort
6368100 our partnership with goodall hospital is an opportunity to work with a trusted community hospital to expand the quality and scope of the primary care available in the kennebunk area
6368101 why why why do we wait till our friends are dead to tell them how great they are were
6368102 we were very happy with all the people who came and supported trailerpark last year so this year we wanted trailerpark to become an event that in itself supports a good cause we therefore decided to mix it all up and broaden both our own and others horizons by changing location expand the musical and artistic genres and turning the festival into a charity event where all proceeds go to the art to action social innovation ghana project
6368103 the proceeds will go to support workshops created by youth in ghana and young entrepreneurs from denmark the themes of the workshops will be amongst others inter media documentary sustainable use of natural resources music and arts by supporting and emphasizing the exchange between young people as well as creative ways of viewing environments and possibilities we believe that the workshops will enhance empowerment by expanding knowledge creativity and communicational skills
6368104 the support from our network has been overwhelming and we are so happy that we can give that love back to them by showcasing and promoting them to huge number of people and companies trailerpark is such a collaborative effort and one that will hopefully just keep growing both locally and globally
6368105 i accepted a commission to paint an old mill i went to the site with the client took photos did an 8x10 inch study refined the viewing angle and began an 18x24 inch canvas after blocking in ive decided that the whole thing is dull uninteresting and wont be worth the price should i do the best i can and finish the thing or go back to the customer and my gallery who arranged the job and admit that i wont do something i cant be proud of and propose a completely different painting which may not meet his needs
6368106 our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt
6368107 in all things purely social we can be as separate as the five fingers and yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress
6368108 if that is all you and your race ask take it
6368109 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
6368110 discussions are ongoing with the iraqis to finalise a bilateral agreement
6368111 we are working to complete the agreement but it is not final yet
6368112 callers did not think they were bound by the do not call list and now they are
6368113 today i drifted monet painting in his floating studio oil painting by douard manet 1874 in the floating studio with camille on the seine at argenteuil the views materialized and dissolved and i was as contented as a cow in her stall
6368114 if were not selling anything maybe we should just call it a day and take whatevers left to good will
6368115 thats okay were having so much fun hanging out together we dont mind not selling much
6368116 do you care if i run out to the mall to get something with the money i made
6368117 ive only been stuck here all day slaving away without a moment to myself no you go maybe i can find some old waxy linoleum to scrape or a toilet i can plunge after i bathe the kids and put them to bed
6368118 when youre in a maze where are you going wheres your backup
6368119 equivalent to saying its o k to piss in st peters as long as you only do it in one corner
6368120 are sacred to at least 13 formally recognized indian tribes and this religious significance is of centuries duration
6368121 using treated sewage effluent to make artificial snow on the most sacred mountain of southwestern indian tribes does not violate the religious freedom restoration act rfra it also holds that a supposed pleading mistake prevents the tribes from arguing under the national environmental act nepa that the forest service failed to consider the likelihood that children and others would ingest snow made from the effluent
6368122 now that means we just need to figure out a way to get them there
6368123 ive also asked for some additional forces on top of that for the current fight
6368124 but i would not use the term surge because i think we need a sustained presence
6368125 but its going to be much much harder to turn things around at this point
6368126 we have a cross border firing incident out of pakistan almost daily and unfortunately those arent diminishing
6368127 there are militant sanctuaries in pakistan and they operate at will
6368128 there are no miracles in football you have to start to organize youth competitions before you can succeed at a higher level
6368129 where football is developed at youth level you have a good national team
6368130 they should start again with the young players and not artificially try to bring in the best from somewhere for the national team and to change them every year
6368131 there must be some continuity there must be a plan of course the people will not be happy when they see the mens team go out in the first round
6368132 they have many qualified agencies and few awards but these students deserve a stipend because they do such good work
6368133 i used to get a lot of fs in regular school but now i get as and bs
6368134 the kids that come to sweetser are hands on learners so they really need to have that hands on training available to them
6368135 a lot of people dont want to take on the responsibility
6368136 well do our opposition meeting this morning and itll probably be a bit shorter because i think if you go into it too much it can become quite daunting
6368137 so lets concentrate on what were trying to achieve rather than looking at the whatever you want to call them behemoth
6368138 theyre a wonderful wonderful wonderful side it will be a tough ask but well go down there and give it our best shot
6368139 were in pretty good form we have been much more consistent in the back half of the year and we want to keep that going
6368140 but going down to a hostile environment like that weve had some good wins down there in the last few years but weve come off a couple of hidings against geelong so we need to make sure were at our best
6368141 i dont think we can afford to keep any of our powder dry its a wonderful learning curve particularly for our younger guys that we go down there play the way we want to play and do the very best we can
6368142 certainly our footy club is not in a position to play ducks and drakes or resting players whereas the cats are probably in a bit of a different position
6368143 theyve got three or four that have been out do they play them or do they give them an extra week to make sure theyre right
6368144 the customer still wants to shop but they must get value and this company offers better value than ive seen anywhere
6368145 i think we are in a fairly steady position although it could have been better
6368146 we bowled really well really consistently with the new ball early on we could have had a bit more luck actually
6368147 i just cant wait to get started im not coming here to make up the numbers i want to play every game
6368148 what would be the point in coming here if i didnt think we could get promoted i think every player here should believe we will get promoted
6368149 you look at the stadium and the fan base and everything about the club suggests that we should be in the championship
6368150 i played my last game for accrington on saturday and then i got a phonecall on sunday morning saying the club had accepted the bid and i was okay to talk to huddersfield
6368151 im glad that gary roberts is here as well we had some great times playing together at accrington so hopefully we can rekindle that
6368152 my time at accrington in the conference was unbelievable i went into every game thinking i would score or that we would win it was a great feeling
6368153 how do you know when a painting is overworked are there boundaries or clues is this judgment left to the artist or the critic
6368154 great is the art of beginning but greater is the art of ending
6368155 it takes two to paint one to paint the other to stand by with an axe to kill him before he spoils it
6368156 why did you spoil it i loved the way it looked yesterday
6368157 level three is when you play as if you never studied a note
6368158 but you can express yourself as simply as when youre talking
6368159 your creation never completely succeeds and theres a kind of addiction that goes with that because the artist is continuously struggling and failing and struggling again but its always a better richer kind of failure
6368160 it never ceases to amaze me the things you put into words that i knew were there but couldnt articulate
6368161 thank you this is exactly what i needed to hear today
6368162 experience is that marvelous thing that enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again
6368163 how about a little more dark here or lighter there
6368164 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
6368165 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
6368166 while hype may not generate large box office receipts it is sure to become another prong in the right wing attack machine
6368167 citizens united head david bossie might be hopeful that as the campaign moves forward some right wing websites might offer the film as a premium as they have for the books
6368168 in order to get regular voters to go see the movie it will have to garner media buzz on the cable television news networks like the anti obama books have
6368169 looking at both the television advertisement for the film and its five minute trailer its clear that neither bossie nor alan peterson the films director have chops theyre no michael moore
6368170 another rich liberal elitist from massachusetts who claims hes a man of the people priceless
6368171 the guy at the country club with the beautiful date holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by
6368172 fahrenheit 911 recognises that the film will likely have a very limited if any run in theaters and he intends to market it via mail order sales on the citizen united website and through other dvd outlets
6368173 bossie is a political hatchet man whose career is based on smears and attacking democrats
6368174 his obama documentary will provide plenty of footage for use on the internet and in commercials but i doubt that in and of itself that
6368175 i assume that the overall theme of obama as socialist agent disguised as cult hero must be resonating in the political marketing surveys of the bossie types and the mccain operatives or they would switch to something more effective
6368176 going back to the days when he was unremitting in his attacks against bill and hillary clinton bossies forte has never been accuracy
6368177 it has been bloodletting and in that regard if hype gets any traction at all it is likely to be viewed as the political counterpart of the horror movie franchise saw v due to be released just before the election
6368178 i thought we played well all in all were just a bit disappointed with the result
6368179 its been good being involved with england ive been in and out of the squad for the last ten years but to be involved under the new boss is brilliant
6368180 im 28 now ive had many years at manchester united and to be playing week in week out will only help my chances of playing for england
6368181 itll be a battle for me again this season to keep my place in the team at united but hopefully i can keep playing well and keep my place with england as well
6368182 it was good to get the goal i dont score many but it was great to get one for my country and contribute to the 2 2 draw
6368183 all i can do is try my hardest to keep my place but the most important thing is that the team plays well and we qualify for the world cup
6368184 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition sharif said in an interview published in the
6368185 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6368186 war on terror have called for stability in the wake of his departure
6368187 he has been saying to me reinstating the judges minus one the one being the chief justice weve said its not a question of any individual its a question of the institution sharif said
6368188 if they are not restored it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying that sharif said
6368189 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify our stay in the coalition iqbal said
6368190 members belonging to our party in the parliament asked asif to become the next president mukhtar said
6368191 there was an understanding between the coalition partners that the presidential candidate would be decided by mutual consensus iqbal said
6368192 they have unilaterally floated the name of mr zardari it is their prerogative but we have not been consulted yet he added
6368193 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6368194 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6368195 we run the risk that our military presence will gradually turn the afghan population entirely against us

6368199 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6368200 you said youd give us a 24 hour stay of execution

6368229 wordsetc is an essential new voice not only for readers already hooked on african writing but for those whod like to read more but arent quite sure what well researched and written lead articles like those on sol plaatje eskia mphahlele and ingrid jonker solid book reviews and insightful features like why i write and writing lives should guarantee wordsetc an honoured place in readers homes and all south african libraries if only there were more
6368230 often as south africans we tend to look to overseas texts as a means of fulfillment as we struggle to accept south africa as a literary nation wordsetc aims to challenge such a mindset and takes into consideration that south africa has indeed much to offer on the literary side of things
6368231 as a writer who treasures writing and beauty i wanted to write to express my gratitude to you for the inspiration of wordsetc i am struck by the high quality of everything from the layout the photography and the writing

6368256 i am concerned that you say oils and acrylics in the same manner as folks make one word out of fruits and vegetables as if bananas are no different from broccoli
6368257 since i am a painter who uses spectral colours and refers to ralph meyers artists handbook any edition for info about permanent non fugitive pigments i wonder what you think about the permanence and quality of materials used in making artworks
6368258 this letter would have been shorter if id have had more time

6368260 friendship multiplies blessings and minimizes misfortunes it is a unique remedy against adversity and it soothes the soul
6368261 it does the heart good to know there are honest lawyers alive and well in this word
6368262 twenty three years into art making i am perpetually discovering the importance of friendship in living a healthy and productive life true friends will always be a reminder of how we are respected and admired loved and valued as artists and as human beings caring for friends opens the heart and gifts us with the privilege of sharing the fruits of our self imposed and necessary solitude
6368263 we hear so much about how art is plagiarized or stolen etc so it was wonderfully uplifting to hear your story and that of your friend

6368272 at this early stage we believe he had fallen from a block of flats
6368273 highly opportunistic does not come close to the true value of continental does not create trust and lacks a convincing strategic rationale
6368274 following the hard work over the last weeks continental has come to an acceptable overall concept
6368275 for its costumers continental remains a reliable long term partner that is extremely well positioned the continental employees can continue to rely on the clear focus of our concept for the future which we have developed over the last years
6368276 these days if you happen to be a poet you have to sing your words to get your ideas out
6368277 poetry is superior to painting in the presentation of words and painting is superior to poetry in the presentation of facts for this reason i judge painting to be superior to poetry
6368278 the greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions
6368279 i can run no more with that lawless crowd while the killers in high places say their prayers out loud
6368280 it seems to me the various art forms are at varying stages of spiritual development which i take to be a progression from identification with finite biology to a union with infinite physics dangling from the lowest rung of jacobs ladder are the verbal modes of expression poor harried humanity in order to deal with the world at the level of animal survival has invented labels for what it sees and has become attached to those names the underlying processes are hidden from dull mens eyes by the dead weight of their illusory forms the visual artist is somewhat more liberated he can transform an animals limited eyes into totally new ways of seeing but the musician that man has forsaken folly and revels in god deals in a fluid medium unseen and unfelt but ecstatically experienced
6368281 art and music intertwine like roots of neighboring trees both planted in the soul of our gifts words and visions bloom forth from experience sweet and sad rich are those who notice who take the time others will pass and perish unknowing
6368282 i used to have some difficulty with assigning titles to paintings but when i started using song lyrics it became very easy sometimes the lyric comes into my head before i finish the painting
6368283 it is much harder to get together a piece of music so it can be performed flawlessly as it must be played flawlessly all at one shot in front of a sometimes critical audience especially true if done with a band getting it all co coordinated and tight a painting can be worked on over time making modifications until it is right
6368284 i am a journalist working in geneva staying a few kilometers east of lucca for the rest of this week with my wife and kids and have been making some efforts of my own at painting in the area dodging the sun and consistently failing to find the right register on the palette
6368285 my goal in my first serious art class was to learn to paint as well as paul simon wrote music
6368286 i have loved leonard cohen for years when i first heard him it was like hearing someone i should have known or had known for a long time and at last he was there
6368287 there is a crack in everything thats where the light comes in
6368288 music moves us in a way that visual art cannot do
6368289 when i was very young i began to see visions of colored shapes dancing whenever i heard music now as a sixty year old i have been able to reproduce the synergy of art music dance that i saw behind my eyes all of my life

6368299 making art like having children is one way of making life worth living and artworks like children are assays of our lives and a measure of the things we hold important for those who would make art the basic proposition is crystal clear finding the work you are meant to do is the central challenge of artmaking and making that work is the central challenge of life
6368300 i spent two weeks at the painting factories in shenzhen china
6368301 you mean to tell me i could cruise the caribbean all winter and be an artist too
6368302 to deter cloning i hide secret symbols in my paintings known only to me ive heard of other artists signing with a thumbprint or other identifying method its worth an extra step
6368303 if a painting can be scanned and printed as a giclee then i dont see a way that it can not be cloned other than collage or other surface embellishments how can one avoid this possibility of cloning
6368304 what an insane concept making art is a solution to the unemployment situation hello i understand the dollar store buying ceramic junk when did artists become retail merchandisers i cant even grasp the concept egad
6368305 the chinese painters need to let their own inner creativity fly and not be boxed into painting factories cloning well known works for wal mart
6368306 if these guys are so talented as they do appear to be why are they not out there fighting the good fight producing their own works and making a name for themselves
6368307 we need to help the chinese understand that world citizenship means respect honour and integrity
6368308 i think america in particular really needs to understand that world citizenship means more than a fast buck it means respect honor and integrity canada is a better example the chinese are very materialistic and making money is one of their most admired goals in life
6368309 anybody can cook but it takes passion to become a great cook
6368310 i love finding that extra something that makes it more engaging
6368311 honesty originality and necessity these are the qualities i sought in choosing the work in this show
6368312 this artwork has been made through original inspiration and with traditional materials no mechanical or digital methods have been used in its creation
6368313 the success of this website the painters keys is due to quality plus word of mouth
6368314 sometimes people who are just beginning of doing something creative they think it may not amount to anything they defeat themselves by thinking that way they dont strive to improve and try different ways of improving their art
6368315 oh so you want to do that today ok lets see where this takes me
6368316 recently i accepted a three month placement in a restaurant gallery called bistango i soon realized that the lighting was inadequate my real dilemma came when i was told my prices would be more than doubled for example my price was 650 their price was 1500 i was astonished is this typical or even appropriate what are my rights in negotiating what my work will sell for as im new at the game am i at the mercy of the system could you give me a general pricing scheme
6368317 its a lot easier to sell organic vegetables from an organic grocery than from a hardware store
6368318 alternative original painting on canvas 11 x 14 inches by jennifer young
6368319 the price you received for your last work must be the benchmark for your future sales never go under it again
6368320 this is primarily the way for a restaurant to get free art let the restaurant buys your work first and then if they want to show it in the dark that is their affair stick out for the right place to show and be consistent at all times with pricing
6368321 my question to you is how did you arrive at those numbers straight per square inch solely based on size x are smaller works charged more less than larger ones based on size do you combine square inch and linear inch or is it all a toss of the coin
6368322 even us evil artist run galleries need to honor appropriate pricing of an artists work so that its comparable to what other venues are using with some minor adjustments for locale we work with our artists on pricing it is a mutual agreement one thing guaranteed to make me unhappy is when an artist enters a booth show and shows work for less than he or she has set as the prices in the gallery its a guarantee that he or she wont show with me again
6368323 the most interesting aspect of love letters to art which arrived yesterday is seeing the immediate connection between your work and the twice weekly letters having taken the concepts of each letter with my own work in mind as each of your readers surely does means there are many different interpretations out there all of them intriguing
6368324 your price to the general public should be the same

6368327 we must take situations as they are we must only change our mental attitudes towards them
6368328 have an attitude of low expectations and nothing to lose
6368329 so i just this evening have emerged from an intensive buddhist meditation retreat and what to my wondering eyes did appear in my mailbox but the zen of art all i could do was smile you know that lovely quiet buddha like smile of something bigger than myself busy at work
6368330 if there is any zen practice that applies it is to empty your mind of initial reactions to statements and fill yourself with compassion and understanding of what is being offered if its off the mark consider that aspect and realize it was offered in good faith not to harm or misrepresent

6368334 to me white is the most depressing colour non colour while black is soothing i dont like grays at all but neither do i like blues except for robins egg blue white reminds me of the inside of a casket it is cold depressing and claustrophobic black makes me feel secure warm and comfortable its the most classic of all the colours

6368337 a local framer generally sells more gold frames however during wars and economic downturns most of his clients select dark frames ive noticed the same thing in my studio usually everyone seems to love plain wide gold frames but since our president declared war on iraq ive been selling a lot more paintings in dark frames

6368340 what does it mean when you happen to like turquoise and lime combined
6368341 from the viewpoint of mind and purpose no one resembles the artist less than those others who share his devices the art of the advertising artist can be understood only by the study of the mind of the salesman the illustrator will find his soul mate in the news reporter or the tabloid photographer the verisimilitude of his descriptions will depend upon what appears real to his employer the fashionable portrait painter
6368342 to moralize nor to segregate art into levels of value
6368343 but we must look elsewhere if we are to find the analogies in human action to enlighten us concerning the activities of the artist it is the poet and philosopher who provide the community of objectives in which the artist participates their chief preoccupation like the artists is the expression in concrete form of their notions of reality like him they deal with the verities of time and space life and death and the heights of exaltation as well as the depths of despair the preoccupation with these eternal problems creates a common ground which transcends the disparity in the means used to achieve them
6368344 it just makes me happy and that will help me heal
6368345 they tend to remain where they have always been in their head
6368346 that girl just took out a canvas and started painting she hardly drew things out at all
6368347 van gogh didnt say thats just an old chair he looked and looked and looked he sensed the beingness of the chair
6368348 we need a solid foundation in technical skill and analytical thinking before we can respond without thinking certain things technical must become so learned that they are automatic freeing us to emotional creativity
6368349 i tend to get bogged down by the detail i think i should paint i have only been painting for 3 years and not full time either ive had painting tutoring for approximately 1 years by two different teachers ive learnt so much but im just so sorry that i only started painting at the age of 50 hopefully i have another 50 years to look forward to
6368350 i particularly was stirred by the tolle mention you made that we are constantly engaged in private thoughts i have traveled all over the world whilst still in my own mind world perhaps i have not traveled at all
6368351 i am more than half way through eckhart tolles book and through so much of it ive thought theres that word again he writes of the
6368352 we all have respect for the effort of our labor the years of study and honing ones skill to the best of our ability but too often a seriousness of self of ones ability clouds the sheer pleasure of what were doing fun and play in artistic endeavors does not mean sloppy careless and without talent i think thats what people fear about allowing play into their work fear in art does more damage than lack of talent
6368353 my creativity mentor the late barbara mettler who brought creative dance to everybody as a creative art activity including visual design and music making reminded us of the french definition of amateur which is lover of
6368354 i find i am stifled by the rules that i have picked up on my journey to be an artist
6368355 that is the best work i have seen you show here
6368356 i paint with a bunch of wonderful women we are a tight group no envy etc but i have begun to understand my needs better i need more but im afraid to hurt feelings plus if i leave i have no place to go i dont fit into any mold in the group my style is all over the place im not satisfied what do you advise
6368357 i dearly love you all but im going into retreat for a while to see if that might beef up my quality
6368358 i am now quite cured of society be it country or town a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself
6368359 my work is always better when im alone and follow my own impressions
6368360 if the artist is serious he must sink himself in solitude
6368361 i have met many talented people who have spent years going from one workshop to the next i have always given them similar advice learn from others but seek your own way miles of canvas later you will see the results of your efforts
6368362 as much as art friends are invaluable for bouncing ideas sharing techniques and generally commiserating i find only when i am alone can i graduate thanks for your insight into the wonderful world of isolation
6368363 another choice is to sit down with such a group and try to redefine the purpose of the group why they meet when they meet what they want to do with their time together check out if the group is open to reconsidering their options
6368364 do you feel this is true of co op gallery membership as well
6368365 thank you very much for publishing the story about my accident and its happy result in the last clickback by noon on the first day it produced 499 views to my website there are 37 visitors on it at this moment how fun
6368366 i have practiced solitude for the past 13 years i couldnt create any other way
6368367 nana youre the best artist in the world and if you were in an art contest with god you would win
6368368 eu gostaria de visitar a todos que est o interessados em promover a situa o dos direitos humanos mas h problemas de limita es de tempo
6368369 boldness has genius power and magic engage and the mind grows heated begin and the work will be completed
6368370 rest not life is sweeping by go dare before you die something mighty and sublime leave behind to conquer time
6368371 we are learning that the act of creation may involve energy of the highest intensity but that it is not hard work or stressful we need to understand the difference between stress and intensity struggle or stress is a sign that the ego has returned as are negative reactions when we encounter obstacles
6368372 thank you for mentioning the early morning club but you neglected to mention how to join
6368373 it is 5 20 a m and a great deal of work is done i already belong
6368374 ive always replied to amateurs and pros alike just paint work and it will start
6368375 new work usually arises from work in progress a sort of domino effect it can start any time of day
6368376 edward vincent of sydney australia who submitted a shakespeare quote
6368377 your club is exactly what i need but the question is how will i stop once the painting starts it may be that i wont it may be that all the others will have to wait a good plan id say thanks for the invitation
6368378 may i suggest the mexican song las ma anitas as our anthem
6368379 painting is like having a baby if you think about it too much you may never get around to doing it
6368380 you know its been well over a year since ive painted
6368381 how do i get started again where do i begin
6368382 esta cole o d uma p ossib ilidade a um p blico mais amplo experimentar com moda criativa
6368383 encontrar um bom equil brio entre o criativo e o comercial foi sempre meu trabalho
6368384 theres something happening here what it is aint exactly clear
6368385 art grows out of each particular situation and i believe that artists are better off working with whatever their environment throws up
6368386 unusually oil painting on canvas 11 x 14 inches by nancy bea miller
6368387 gertrude stein when asked how she knew a piece of art was good replied it makes me itch as artists we never know where a viewers itchy spot is but we need to hit it making wood sculpture it is very often pure sensuality believe me that scares many people
6368388 the joy we can bring to our patrons is very nourishing
6368389 thank you for sending me this letter exactly when i needed the most today i am going to paint and i am not going to stop painting until tuesday it is friday i appreciate your wisdom please continue to send me your letters as i learn so much from reading them i have yet to try reading other peoples thoughts i feel it is too soon one person at a time in any of my communication is much more my speed although i do read my horoscopes and tarot readings most days which i have a weakness for
6368390 the brain makes behavior if you can effectively measure the brain which we think we can we can give you information thats not available through any other methodology
6368391 it excites me in a way that no other painting ever has
6368392 i am a quilter i had a solo show a few years ago now and it was a very revealing time both for me as a person and an observer of people i made it a point to be available on saturdays to meet and interact with the guests watching them look at talk about my work was almost an out of body experience there was more emotion rather than rationale in the purchases
6368393 i understand where you are coming from saying that the first thing which touches you is pattern but for me the first thing that touches me is color and mood i think how do we know what is the first thing which attracts us so many things are probably happening at the same time but i think i see color and mood first
6368394 i am currently in a small show and when i found out i hadnt won anything i rushed through the rest of the show looking at the pieces as the competition hows he she better than me or with disdain
6368395 i suggest revisiting kumar and melamids examinations of consumer desires in art production their conclusions are perhaps even more enlightening than dr knights
6368396 where will we put it the frames no good etc
6368397 the more successful paintings just fall off the brush the less successful ones take longer
6368398 the enemy of a good plan is the search for a perfect plan
6368399 if i make the effort to understand and implement this strategy how much of a difference could it realistically make in the end vs
6368400 the less time you spend trying to learn everything there is to know about stocks bonds and mutual funds the better off you are
6368401 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street creation the faster and farther investors should run
6368402 if you work too hard at investing and youre too active in the financial markets youll probably lose your shirt
6368403 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
6368404 although its impossible to prove that a complex approach is unproductive academic research and investor behavior suggest that complexity preys on tendencies that can do a lot of damage to our portfolios
6368405 all of us would be better investors if we just made fewer decisions
6368406 to invest successfully you need not understand beta efficient markets modern portfolio theory option pricing or emerging markets you may in fact be better off knnowing nothing of these
6368407 the key to whatever success i may have enjoyed during my long investment career is that the lord gave me enough common sense to recognize the majesty of simplicity
6368408 has asked the supervisory board to be released from his responsibilities
6368409 to support the ongoing strategy and business policies of continental ags management board while maintaining its current market and brand appearance and to not demand a sale of activities or seek other material structural measures
6368410 guarantor for ensuring the interests of all stakeholders of continental
6368411 those colours colors change not only with varying light sources but also after you have had free machine embroidery over painted canvas 23 x 32 inches by b j adams
6368412 these people generally lack the experience and knowledge to express themselves in any other way no drawing skills no sense of perspective and no need for academic training just the computer and its associated machinery are providing a cheap way to muscle into the arts
6368413 when you see photos and movies of rich color underwater you can be sure that either they were filmed on shallow reefs in tanks or with flood lights
6368414 try using a venetian red ground on your canvases i have for nearly 20 years it was originally shown to me by my mentor and teacher howard fussiner
6368415 when looking at paintings through a red lens colours are reduced to black and white i found a pair of sunglasses with red lenses and i occasionally don them when in doubt about the values in a painting
6368416 the colour is very strong resource of effect also requires honest application if the artist will use it for good things he will get god blessing to have force of the real artist and as soon as the real artist is sent to earth by god the real artist must remember always about his mission at the earth
6368417 in my world there is a sixth use of color that is the use of color in the realm of spirit or magic
6368418 stuarts done photography for us for 20 years his photos adorn the walls of our offices hes made such a difference blakes a relative newcomer but hes become another angel he videotapes everything for us
6368419 they both are among the nicest people you can meet
6368420 its a great honor to be acknowledged by the portland ballet
6368421 my involvement is one of great respect appreciation and love
6368422 one of the things that impresses me about the ballet and got me involved is their attitude toward education and the wellbeing of their students
6368423 thats the most important thing in a competitive society they are one example of sanity and proper values
6368424 it started with my wife taking lessons there she mentioned to them that i had a then hobby of videography ive now turned that into a retirement business i owe a lot of that to the portland ballet ive been getting just as much as i give in the work i do for them
6368425 in the past the award has been a beautiful framed and signed photo by stuart
6368426 we thought that wouldnt be appropriate this year so this year well be giving a painting by jan roberson each recipient will receive a painting by her a signed framed work of art
6368427 we want what is best for the students because we are trying to not have an impact on the education of the students and continue high standards of education
6368428 if the founding principle of this rsu committee is keeping a school open then lets put some teeth behind the principle
6368429 im not sure including this would float with the kennebunk taxpayers
6368430 i respect totti hugely he has always scored goals against me in every way long range shots lobs free kicks
6368431 because these youth are extremely vulnerable to exploitation by adult criminals
6368432 has directed the juvenile probation department in no uncertain terms
6368433 ultimately the decisions must be made by the mayor and that is where the buck stops
6368434 now beauty is in the eye of the beholder beauty can be a good set of teeth beauty is nice wavy hair beauty can be blue eyes or green eyes
6368435 there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive
6368436 returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex hungry starved men that will pounce upon the first girl that they see walking down the street
6368437 great art is deeply ordered even if within the order there may be enormously instinctive and accidental things nevertheless they come out of a desire for ordering and for returning fact onto the nervous system in a more violent way
6368438 the town currently has no protection against large extractions at the regional or state level
6368439 a reasonable ordinance will take time to craft this will give us time this is not an anti water district vote its an attempt to protect the town
6368440 testing pumping and transport of wells groundwater surface water aquifers springs and well water
6368441 transportation through wells of water that has been pumped for other locations
6368442 were concerned the moratorium would limit our ability to look for ground water in 2007 the state passed significant regulations branch brook is not going to dry up and were not going to hurt it with this
6368443 we want to allow the citizens to decide if they want to allow a high impact business in town
6368444 we would like the moratorium to protect not just the water districts land but that of private citizens were not attacking poland spring or the water district
6368445 there are thousands of acres around the aquifer that are not permanently protected
6368446 this revenue would allow the water district to buy up the acreage what if a business bought this up an industrial accident caused a toxic spill the aquifer could be ruined
6368447 i had experience some years back of going through board of environmental protection and department of environmental protection hearings
6368448 if anyone thinks your rights are protected by the bep dep or public utilities commission i have several bridges i want to sell you i think people should look at the resources in town and protect them to say the state is going to protect you good luck
6368449 we teach kids to be less focused on themselves and more on the community
6368450 they spend a couple hours each week on the project the kids are learning leadership skills
6368451 we decided to exist to equip kids to think live and bring about change in a culture that says kids are going backward not forward
6368452 in doing my masters thesis i found that what makes a difference in a kids life is an adult whos truly involved we are deeply involved in their lives in discipling and mentoring them
6368453 we wanted to form a school where kate would both know others and be known in deeper life changing ways and be challenged in every part of her life
6368454 three teachers with 12 kids is a great ratio its challenging academically but also personally and spiritually its not for every kid
6368455 were preparing them for college in intense ways and theres also a decidedly spiritual component its the education you dream about for your kid a partnering of school with the home
6368456 they taught the kids how to fundraise how to write a fundraising letter how to make a call how to run an event make a budget and develop a profit and loss statement
6368457 they were an energetic group very focused on what they were doing
6368458 we had a conversation with nancy parsons and rosemary moore and talked about how the project would fit the needs of the council we came up with the baby bag project it was a wonderful experience for the council and the kids from veritas they got an up close look at the workings of a nonprofit
6368459 its wonderful for the council to have an opportunity to expose future leaders to community service and citizenship
6368460 it teaches them as kids to support those kinds of community activities
6368461 the tuition is 4 200 per year but well work with parents and kids if they cant afford that
6368462 its a tremendous project and its going to freshen the property
6368463 you can sit down and talk to someone but if youve never gone through what a soldiers done its hard to get them to understand where they are coming from
6368464 it was real nice of him to think of taking a couple of people out with him
6368465 honestly were the forgotten soldiers they always remember those who died and those who are fighting but there is a group of people who are not in those categories it puts us in a dead mans place
6368466 hopefully next year they can expand and get even more guys down here on the boat
6368467 it worked out fantastic seemed like the guys had a great time it sure made me feel good
6368468 i suppose its better than nothing for someone who is nearly completely ignorant about asset allocation and wants to spend 5 minutes to arrive at a solution to a very complex issue
6368469 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
6368470 with this agreement the dispute regarding the public takeover offer by the frankish family owned business for the international car parts supplier has been settled
6368471 ive been painting seriously for the last fifteen years and i now have trouble deciding what to paint how do i decide
6368472 be miserable or motivate yourself whatever has to be done its always your choice
6368473 sometimes i feel a lack of inspiration what i do is paint backgrounds of colors chosen by the spur of the moment i take my time and often meditate when making the brush strokes
6368474 and the corollary how is it that there never seems to be enough time to paint everything that i have lined up to paint the ideas crowd in like the folks in the line up at tim hortons for morning coffee
6368475 my ideas come from a moleskin book of mind maps that i keep next to me on my work table i believe it was tony buzan who wrote several books on mind maps and this is an excellent approach to creativity
6368476 i recently took a workshop from lew lehrman of scottsdale he talked about how to decide what to paint he described the english way and the french way he favors the french way the english spend days searching for the perfect view then if they have to they will lash themselves to a tree enduring an onslaught of wind and pelting rain to paint that view the french go to their favorite outdoor caf order a bottle of wine and paint whatever happens to be in view lehrman teaches art journaling which is very helpful in learning to find interesting things to paint everywhere you go
6368477 piggybacking a bit on your last letter the thought walk this weeks what to paint also serves to inspire and reflect walking 3 miles 5 times a week not only clears my head and keeps my weight down but opens my mind to the endless possibilities that abound in nature
6368478 the atlantic ocean barrier island where i live and do art has many and various changing dimensions in color and form largely due to the effect of the seasons it provides me a never ending visual experience to inspire my work
6368479 i wonder if the source behind the question what should i paint is having expectations that every painting is going to be pretty should be finished quickly and that it has to sell allowing for the options of experimentation mystery even vulnerability to failure opens up a world of potential
6368480 true creativity flows only from stillness when stillness becomes conscious the spiritual dimension enters your life and you begin to be guided by an intelligence far greater than the human mind
6368481 what am i going to do with you every now and then i get a student who is so f ing afraid of her own power
6368482 you have a big vision you should be working on big canvases
6368483 what am i going to paint what do i want to see
6368484 in the beginners mind there are many possibilities in the experts mind there are few
6368485 the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes
6368486 i am not artist while i am not able to copy ayvazovsky zurbaran and buguero
6368487 who says you have to put perspective into your work
6368488 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
6368489 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
6368490 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
6368491 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
6368492 as im sure you know this past winter was a tough one for many families because of the extremely high cost of fuel and the early and severe onset of cold weather
6368493 your gift came at a very opportune time and we thank you please convey our deep appreciation to the steadfast donors who year after year have kept the warm home fund alive
6368494 i not only felt i was blindsided by what was taking place but this board was acting not so much like a judge and jury but to me more like a kangaroo court
6368495 the actions of this board in looking to satisfy the concerns of the fire personnel on some comments i made at a brush fire at my residence have now become completely political in nature and represent little more than character assassination
6368496 in summary one need not be an attorney educated in the law to know that robert j higgins was unquestionably deprived of the fundamental rights of all citizens to due processof the law
6368497 i think that we have an obligation as citizens in our town that we treat each other with decency
6368498 the stay is important because it keeps me on the ballot
6368499 even if the maine court acts and grants the stay the likelihood is that we cannot depend on them to maintain the stay until the ballots are printed were protecting ourselves by going to the u s supreme court
6368500 if its approved we then file a writ of certiorari asking for a hearing on the constitutional issues
6368501 were modestly confident they will agree to hear the case
6368502 im saving this spot for my sister shes two cars behind you
6368503 i was only trying to park in a 30 minute spot but a guy said he was saving it for someone and wouldnt let me in
6368504 im not going to give you a ticket im just going to give you a warning
6368505 no we are not allowed to divulge this information to the public
6368506 distinguished civic or conservation work making permanent improvement for public benefit e
6368507 it really is a nod to a lot of effort and a lot of people
6368508 i embrace the meaning of this park and what it stands for all of us in the community
6368509 you should have a look at those words and the flags it gives me goose bumps to this day
6368510 ive been seeing people reading books or just taking walks through there
6368511 i came here at the age of six weeks in a laundry basket so you see with the exception of a few summers i have been coming here a long time
6368512 if hearing with our ears and listening with our hearts we may get to know others where they are coming from at a deeper level this could help in responding to others instead of reacting and reducing and lessen that old stress that plays havoc with blood pressure heart and digestive system problems
6368513 if you need a jolt of summer memories to sustain you through the long winter this video captures those moments and sounds
6368514 the photography is stunning particularly the ocean breaking on the rocks below and the wide vistas of the marginal way and beach beyond all enhanced by a beautiful sound track
6368515 they gave me a list and i interviewed 15 people
6368516 everybodys emotional connection to the marginal way moved me closer to understanding what formed the soul of ogunquit i was taken aback by so many little stories a lot of community involvement and concern
6368517 its the first round of a general election so the state of washington in a literal sense and historic sense no longer has a primary the parties really cant choose their own nominees anymore
6368518 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters
6368519 theres a certain logic that says they ought to be the ones squaring off in november theyll have to campaign through november and be accountable to voters thats healthy for our process
6368520 im not sure where its going to go we dont have any immediate plans to claim harm from what happened yesterday in a legal sense well see how this all pans out
6368521 al parecer dos hombres hicieron estallar las bombas que llevaban consigo frente a la f brica mientras hab a un cambio de turnos del personal
6368522 otherwise its the end of the world as we know it
6368523 we know what we are but know not what we may be
6368524 deferred oil painting on canvas 24 x 36 inches by stacey l peterson
6368525 younger smarter people original painting who seem to have dropped out of the creative race
6368526 the young are as they are due to the allowances and carelessness of liberal immoralities which has allowed their parents to let them become the vegetables and weeds you describe sown mainly by the likes of by freidan spock et al
6368527 your point about laziness and lack of discipline suggests the hell bound basket be woven from liberal permissiveness encouraging dreamy baby eyed vision and childlike abandon are all very fine if it results in a meaningful and thoughtfully executed canvas
6368528 i object to the tone of the article which pre supposes that only young people can be innovative and challenge the norm
6368529 i am beginning to believe this is a unilateral work ethic problem across america thinking we are worth mucho dollars but not really eager to work hard enough to earn them thanks for your letters that make us think a little deeper on a booklist i found the 4 hour workweek escape 9 5 live anywhere and join the new rich hardcover by timothy ferriss author how ironic that wraps the problem up in a nutshell eh
6368530 maybe all those young people who are dropping out and sleeping in should paint people sleeping since thats what they know yawn
6368531 our partnership with goodall hospital is an opportunity to work with a trusted community hospital to expand the quality and scope of the primary care available in the kennebunk area
6368532 i always see original art only as a prerequisite to entering art shows a definition is seldom forthcoming is this like one of those rooms you are not supposed to enter until the preacher comes to visit or do you make your own rules and endure the consequences if youre wrong
6368533 take pains and pleasure in constantly copying the best works you can find
6368534 out in the sun painters are lined up the first is copying nature the second is copying the first the third is copying the second
6368535 one begins to copy oneself and to copy oneself is more dangerous than to copy others it leads to sterility
6368536 every conceivable aspect of painting has its roots in copying painters are by nature copyists
6368537 original art only can refer to no giclee prints too
6368538 life can be so heavy and misty we paint because we paint what matters if someone has painted written it or thought it before if i have said something someone else has said and someone else needs it what be the problem
6368539 i belong to the ohio plein air group and they go as far to say that you cant use anything that you have done for a class the easy way that we do it is to say that it must be done outside and no camera or computer may be used this takes a lot of problems out of the copy problem
6368540 in the world of coloured pencil art societies there has been much debate of late about the nature of original art in relation to their juried exhibitions and recent changes in the rules by way of response i wrote this post on my blog about their notions of what original art is all about it seemed to resonate with an awful lot of people
6368541 if a person ignores copyright infringement laws and enjoys suffering from a law suit then go for it art is not what you can get away with but what you create
6368542 i was in a juried show and was there when the judges came in they were both young people who had no art background but worked for the local historical society i gained a perspective on judges and jurying and on accepted and rejected works which makes it easier to put work out there for judgment years ago i avoided juried shows later i met an artist who had a piece rejected in a show only to have it win a prize in the next show she entered
6368543 you are fooling yourself because the trained eye can tell when a painting or drawing has been projected
6368544 its a long time since the studio curtains were laundered
6368545 the moment my legs begin to move my thoughts begin to flow
6368546 going out for a walk i really found i was going in
6368547 there is a real problem of course for those of us who are old disabled or just lazy
6368548 what really triggers my creativity is taking a nice hot shower
6368549 yesterday i watched a brilliant art teacher grade 8 who said at regular intervals okay who wants to go run around the building when they returned she greeted them like new students and put them on fresh tasks you smell like fresh laundry she said to one group thank god for pragmatists
6368550 bruce chatwin author of the songlines the anatomy of restlessness and others famously said if i cant walk i cant live not long after illness kept him bed bound this relatively young man died
6368551 one big problem i cant walk im in a wheelchair
6368552 it is our responsibility to the residents of the commonwealth to remove this poison from the food supply
6368553 i believe that this kind of a measure would be as significant as the states historic ban on smoking in workplaces in terms of its affecting all of the residents of the state and in terms of reducing a contributing factor to a deadly disease
6368554 has wide ranging powers and i believe that this prohibition may just fit within those powers
6368555 hundreds of people may die from the continued ingestion of trans fat
6368556 the federal government says there is no safe level of trans fat
6368557 but i also believe that banning it statewide will offer added protection for the health of the residents of the state heart disease is either the number one or number two cause of death in the state and we think the evidence is undeniable that trans fat is a serious and harmful contributor to heart disease
6368558 there was a very high standard and we had quite a few with over 500 points
6368559 those results were not reflected here our results in those areas were way above average
6368560 the results are consistent with the work which the students put in over the year
6368561 eventhough the leaving cert results can be got over the internet now the vast majority of students went to collect theirs in person at
6368562 monday when the cao offers come out will colour the results for people its a pity they cant just take them for what they are
6368563 it tells everybody that we are very serious about offering a high quality of care
6368564 there is a critical point beyond which too many cooks in the same kitchen may produce more harm than good
6368565 eventually trauma center patients go to one of many centers rather than a limited number of centers of excellence
6368566 there are zero trauma centers in chinatown which is a neighborhood where people live
6368567 this is really about serving the patients who have come here and will continue to come here
6368568 more people are realising the financial and environmental benefits of an efficient boiler
6368569 we want to process those patients more quickly but more importantly safely and thoroughly
6368570 urgent patients still receive the same high priority care while patients with less critical illnesses such as flu ear infections sprains and suture removals are treated by a separate team of health care providers
6368571 thats a lot for a small hospital and this year well surpass last years total
6368572 older people often have other existing issues compounded by small problems they may currently be having
6368573 this is great it can adjust to any size patient and it cuts down on staff injuries
6368574 one person can do this without the risk of straining their back
6368575 i can tell you there never would have been 21 million spent here because the hospital just didnt have the money
6368576 the merger allowed us to do so many things that never would have been possible
6368577 if you need a jolt of summer memories to sustain you through the long winter this video captures those moments and sounds
6368578 the photography is stunning particularly the ocean breaking on the rocks below and the wide vistas of the marginal way and beach beyond all enhanced by a beautiful sound track
6368579 they gave me a list and i interviewed 15 people
6368580 everybodys emotional connection to the marginal way moved me closer to understanding what formed the soul of ogunquit i was taken aback by so many little stories a lot of community involvement and concern
6368581 despite an injury time act by joe cole englands supposed bright new dawn under fabio capello is suddenly looking like all our miserable yesterdays
6368582 the italian coachs ludicrous claims that his england side are a match for euro 2008 champions spain were exposed for the hollow irrelevance they were
6368583 last night england were shapeless aimless and hopeless tactically chaotic and technically stunted a mess from start to finish
6368584 if the smell of blood on the carpet at fa headquarters soho square this morning is familiar so too last night was the stale odour of an england performance that carried more than a whiff of the dregs of the steve mcclaren era
6368585 one of the worst performances ive seen from an england team
6368586 denmark were better than us in the first half but we reacted well and ended up playing a good game against high level opposition
6368587 we have to recognise that if it hadnt been for defender carles puyol and goalkeeper iker casillas we would have conceded at least one goal but the players confidence and skill allowed us to overcome the poor start and win the game
6368588 weve got two world cup qualifiers coming up and we have to get things right because we cant afford to make any mistakes we are the favourites to win but we cant slip up especially when we play at home
6368589 this system worked at the european championship with the players we have in the team we need to keep playing the same way and it worked against denmark especially in the second half
6368590 there are a lot of young players in this team and we havent fulfilled our potential yet
6368591 we want to continue the same progress we made at euro 2008 and with del bosque it looks as though we are going to maintain the momentum
6368592 i do have to take it to half the country
6368593 i remember coming here when the well was just a hole in the ground
6368594 today marks the second anniversary of these maine silver star medals being presented to our heroes
6368595 maine veterans throughout history have exemplified a proud tradition of service we have one of the highest rates of veterans in the nation
6368596 growth in terms of value its not horrible but its not as good as it could be
6368597 they have many qualified agencies and few awards but these students deserve a stipend because they do such good work
6368598 i used to get a lot of fs in regular school but now i get as and bs
6368599 the kids that come to sweetser are hands on learners so they really need to have that hands on training available to them
6368600 a lot of people dont want to take on the responsibility
6368601 and this year is no exception as more venues around town offer unique events and performances sept 1 through 14 what started out as a few days of special events has expanded to two weeks to accommodate all of the activities offered
6368602 thats more than 10 percent of the applications we received in all of 2007
6368603 its an easy process and it doesnt take much time at all
6368604 all the applicant needs to do is call us to set up an appointment then on the day of the appointment the applicant needs to bring in the required documentation
6368605 but it helps us as well the more clients we can see off site that is in town halls rather than here at the yccac main office in sanford the easier it is for us to get the applications in the pipeline and processed for payment
6368606 my characters family the eynesford hills have fallen behind the times but when freddy meets liza he doesnt care what people think its like seeing everything for the first time director shaun kerrison wants us to succeed when he comes out and shakes our hands its a satisfying experience my fair lady is the most classical american theater piece what a treat it is to share the stage with jefferson mays tim jerome and conrad john schuck
6368607 there are no miracles in football you have to start to organise youth competitions before you can succeed at a higher level
6368608 where football is developed at youth level you have a good national team
6368609 they should start again with the young players and not artificially try to bring in the best from somewhere for the national team and to change them every year
6368610 there must be some continuity there must be a plan of course the people will not be happy when they see the mens team go out in the first round
6368611 north korea has apparently given up its home field advantage
6368612 the two associations have been discussing this for a long time
6368613 it is not us it is the two national associations who have decided
6368614 you have to put in the work have the vision and be goal oriented its the same in athletics youre never off the clock theres always something you can do better

6368621 the problem is that very few of the billions of images will ever be registered no artist that i know of has the time to pull out every work of art they have ever produced and register them with all the upcoming electronic databases
6368622 well weve talked to the oil industry and they promise us this practice will be stopped within 30 years
6368623 much scholarship is currently being compromised or stopped altogether by the inability to get permissions and as a result many artists are losing out on critical and scholarly research on their work

6368627 there are two orphan artworks bills before the us congress s
6368628 we are scheduled for a correction that dwarfs the depression they actually think they can finance iraq and other military projects with such fee based revenues myself i will pull my website and return to the old ways of doing business
6368629 the orphan works act attempts to offer options to would be publishers and others who have exhausted all efforts to find authors in order to get permission to use
6368630 dont call it the orphan works act call it stealing
6368631 i urge everyone posting on the internet to upload images under 600 pixels wide and with a clear copyright directly on the image
6368632 thats exactly why its being done so that disney can keep on stealing from artists as they have done for years
6368633 well weve talked to the oil industry and they promise us this practice will be stopped within 30 years

6368648 its amazing how it has energized our support and our efforts
6368649 we have to keep up that energy and i think they will continue to take notice
6368650 we put it on hold for a bit but decided that it was still important to continue this effort
6368651 right now i have nothing until we go to florida and attempt a few outdoor records
6368652 at my age group i know i can get them

6368662 they gloss over the fact that a 101 year old buster martin completed the london marathon in just over 10 hours and he stopped for a pint along the way thats the greatest athletic achievement in this century and they didnt invite him to beijing for a lap or anything
6368663 the masters track and field competitions is a cinderella group all over the world
6368664 many are old olympians who want to hang in but other than friends and family theres nobody there to see them compete
6368665 about 50 years ago a channel was constructed by means of bulkheads and piling which ran from perkins cove up to flat pond as a result of this helpful though crude improvement a thriving fishing business sprung up it is said that 26 whaleboats and 10 dories were engaged in business at one time since then the natural course of the sea has washed away the channel and the fishing business has practically died out as a result the association wants the harbor rebuilt
6368666 a small fixed footbridge owned by the ogunquit village corporation crosses the josias river 550 feet from its mouth this footbridge has a horizontal clearance of approximately 30 feet and a vertical clearance of about 5 feet at mean high water no federal permit was issued for the construction of this bridge the proposed improvement would necessitate the reconstruction of the span to provide a draw opening of sufficient horizontal clearance for navigation
6368667 a letter from the war department stated that the bridge at perkins cove prevented a coast guard patrol boat from entering the cove and improvements or changes would have to be made
6368668 the high winds and rain of last wednesday loosened the ice to such an extent in perkins cove that it broke and started out to sea on its way it took bridge and all with it there is now only a small portion of the bridge remaining on either side of the river the draw and parts of the bridge went out workmen were able to rescue part of the bridge however and fasten it to a point about a hundred yards or so below the original location
6368669 each piece of art is an exploration i tackle only those projects that feel fresh and exciting i try to make each painting as dramatic as possible with strong contrast and expressive colors that play against each other

6368674 my husband was the one who originally signed up but he had a mountain biking accident late june and broke both of his arms so he was unable to compete i figured i would give it a shot and take my husbands place
6368675 since i did not have much time to train i decided my goal would be to finish
6368676 i took my time and enjoyed the scenery im not sure if that 2 06 51 is a good time or not but im happy that i finished
6368677 im not sure if i will do another tri or not if i were to i would definitely concentrate on the swimming piece of it the swim was the toughest part since i am not much of a swimmer
6368678 i had four new tires and they were all tight i knew that we would be able to get there if we didnt wreck when i went three wide down the backstretch for third and disposed of travis benjamin and trevor sanborn thats when i knew this race was over and they needed to get out of my way
6368679 i knew that he had a good car but i also knew that there was no way he would beat me on that restart
6368680 when we got back up there johnny was on a rail so i dont know if we had anything for him but it was good to at least get there to battle for one lap so im happy with what we did
6368681 there was a lot of pressure on me tonight a lot of people came out to watch me and i had high expectations i was doing my best to try and get that win but it was still good to get second its good to be home and to know that we have that much support behind us that is a good feeling and i had a great time

6368696 my hand is the implement of a distant sphere it is not my head that functions but something else something higher something somewhere remote i must have great friends there dark as well as bright new friends
6368697 my most recent transgression two weeks ago happened when i used an atv to seek a painting opportunity this event disclosed in one small paragraph in a previous letter caused more than two hundred purists to unsubscribe
6368698 ill just have to keep receiving your missives to find out in what other ways youre such an awful person
6368699 i guess when its transportation for an artist its a lot different from atv ing for the hell of it
6368700 sorry so many people objected to your atv youll not find me objecting
6368701 one comment to your critics to err is human to forgive divine their loss
6368702 how about thou shall not get cadmium yellow all over ones self no matter how many times the wind blows the easel over
6368703 why would you care about 200 unforgiving green subscribers who apparently only see things in black or white
6368704 please do not stop what you do i dont think you will but i ask anyway i am not your typical artist so my request may mean little but it has to be more than those who protest i have never been a purist hopefully never will be
6368705 i would add to your list of shalts the following most important sacrament thou shalt not torture the fish you catch
6368706 well good for the purists leaving you at the top of the mountain with all the viewpoints i am sure that their point of marshlands and lowlands in the shadows has some merit i am also sure that you get off your atv as i do and allow the moose to walk freely and closer to your area of work
6368707 i think this reaction is actually hilarious wish we could see how those unsubscribers pollute their environments
6368708 well talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face
6368709 few will have the greatness to bend history but each of us can work to change a small portion of the events and in the total of all these acts will be written the history of this generation
6368710 blessed are the flexible for they shall not be bent out of shape
6368711 ive got to say it was a very positive meeting as long as there is an understanding and both sides respect each other then we will be halfway there
6368712 referees have an important role to play and although people say the best referees are the ones that arent seen i think those days are gone because of media coverage
6368713 they will make mistakes and that the mistakes have got to be accepted they asked if referees are accountable and we explained how they are accountable
6368714 there is an observer system and we analyse them but we are not going to hang any referee out to dry
6368715 it got a bit heated at times but i felt it was a big plus and it helped to clear the air
6368716 i think the idea is great and there should be one at the beginning of the season and one in the middle in case other hiccups or problems arise
6368717 it was one of the worst performances the second half was dire what positives can you take from that the players are not recognisable from the ones we see in the premier league every weekend
6368718 weve produced one of the finest midfield players in the world in steven gerrard he is a colossus we stick him on the left wing hes not a winger he has got to be in the middle of the park where he can influence the game we are killing him
6368719 we keep changing managers but the performances dont improve if steve mcclaren had been in charge of that team there would have been uproar wembley would have gone barmy
6368720 the problem is you get people who play for their clubs and they are loved they play for chelsea like frank lampard the fans idolise them they come off here and they are booed by 70 000 people

6368722 was outside the building in a car at the time of the murder
6368723 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary
6368724 wood was involved in the robbery in this case because of his longstanding mental illness that allowed him to be easily manipulated by the principal actor daniel reneau
6368725 executing someone who didnt kill violates the most basic principles of justice
6368726 if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury
6368727 it is awkward and quite strange to see states force inmates to take medication so they can be killed but this is the hateful nature of our capital punishment system
6368728 he will be released on parole today thursday from the barberton correctional services centre im not what time it would be though
6368729 we congratulate the british cycling team on this amazing achievement it is great to be able to apply our engineering expertise in this way and a privilege to work with these top athletes
6368730 were delighted that we have been able to help them achieve gold in beijing making all of our hard work together worthwhile
6368731 working with the team at wumtia has been a truly world class experience their enthusiasm and passion for excellence has never faltered during this olympiad
6368732 we hope our working relationship will continue to go from strength to strength over the next four years as we try and build on the knowledge and insights we have gained in cycling and many of our other leading sports
6368733 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6368734 going into the day some reasonably good earnings gave us a positive bias and also it seems to me that the commodity stocks which have been pretty beaten up are having a very strong rebound
6368735 but this may be just bargain hunting as i havent seen any economic numbers that would be driving this
6368736 until the fannie and freddie issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6368737 are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the price of oil is on a weekly basis
6368738 ive watched sammy throughout the years tying him its ok i guess
6368739 everybody else does im more concerned about getting hits and getting on base you get hits and home runs happen but it is good to get the first one at home
6368740 it seemed like no matter what we threw up there they were covering it with their barrels somehow
6368741 its a tough stretch for me personally the last two weeks ive been kind of out of rhythm
6368742 theyve got a good ballclub theyre really rolling and i wish we could have given them some better competition this week
6368743 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6368744 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6368745 i think it definitely shows hes strong and capable of throwing about 120 pitches
6368746 actually i didnt think my fastball and location were that great at all
6368747 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did tonight
6368748 i got my adrenaline flowing around the eighth inning and the defense played great behind me
6368749 the toughest thing for me is to keep the ball down more consistently
6368750 its not a maybe thing youve got to do it ive got to work on that because its killing me

6368759 the illegal march started at about 04 00 this morning by taxi operators of the kempton park taxi association
6368760 two cars were damaged they slashed all four tyres on both cars one of the motorists said they also took money from him
6368761 the police warned them to disperse because the march was illegal but they refused to disperse the police fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd

6368773 no middle name at all i just love my name i also have the curious condition of having all the vowels including the neo vowel y appearing just once i also have people who love my stone sculptures
6368774 my parents resisted the pressure from a section of the family to call me batty now that would have been a step too far i believe that i would never have become the person i am today if they had succumbed to that pressure
6368775 rick rogers i like my name but robert genn sounds cooler
6368776 no two artists are alike no two personalities are alike no two styles are alike similar perhaps but never the same so feel the pride of your accomplishment sign your name
6368777 my name is john johnson i come from wisconsin i work in the coal mines there
6368778 a rose by any other name would still smell as sweet
6368779 not mans name embellishes him but man himself embellishes his name
6368780 now there is a last name i will never forget
6368781 write your name in small letters be humble if any one wants to find it they will
6368782 we dont know who we are until we can see what we can do
6368783 geri it was a time in life when i wanted to be a

6368785 we supported him on impeachment its now his turn to support us on the reinstatement of judges
6368786 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6368787 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6368788 thailand is not allowing him to enter the country and hong kong is turning him back so there is no choice for him now worawat said
6368789 it is the responsibility of thai airways to take him out of the country

6368800 the light is so enchanting how can we all keep our eyes from it in a lifeless existence
6368801 the only way to grow is to prosper from learning the only way you are going to learn is if you take the time
6368802 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable it really is a case of hidden nature revealing itself to the world after remaining in splendid isolation for so long and demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6368803 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk accidentally it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken one hundred years to get from the balustrade to the house so were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden

6368811 the long term improvement in physical function that we observed in patients who have undergone knee replacement surgery is striking when set against the decline that occurred in the comparison group
6368812 these benefits extended to those patients who were clinically obese our results show that as long as appropriate selection criteria are applied with regard to fitness for surgery there seems little justification for withholding the operation from patients who are obese
6368813 we expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures
6368814 opinion is divided over the reasons for the loss of this species
6368815 climate change over fishing pollution and habitat destruction have all been advanced as possible causes however no research has been carried out to fully quantify the burbots decline this study will examine the role of changes in water temperature habitat connectivity and river discharge in the burbots extinction
6368816 we would like to encourage members of the public particularly those who have a close relationship with our rivers and waterways to take time to complete the survey as opinions gathered will be a vital component of our research
6368817 as a result of a veterinary assessment staff from both taronga zoo and seaworld say the whales condition has rapidly deteriorated
6368818 its condition is such that they cannot be sure that it would survive until the morning
6368819 the recommendation they made to us which weve accepted is that they humanely euthanize the whale tonight provided they can find it
6368820 weve conveyed this to the rspca and theyve agreed with our assessment
6368821 thats exactly what whales will do when theyre curious about something
6368822 the calf is physically not big enough to make really strong sounds
6368823 the only good solution would be if the mother starts a wider search pattern and reconnects with this calf or if another female just happened to be in the area and had lost its calf
6368824 when youre melancholy you tend to step back and examine your life
6368825 is so full of a number of things that im sure we should all be as happy as kings
6368826 the overemphasis of drugs is a knee jerk reaction thats thrown our whole concept of happiness out of whack happiness is now seen as a lack of suffering as opposed to accomplishing important societal goals like creating art
6368827 how do you make art in a society with no conflict
6368828 one never knows true happiness until one experiences true sadness
6368829 one must endure the pain to enjoy the wealth of happiness and joy
6368830 a host of golden daffodils a mountain stream or a robins nest on which to contemplate
6368831 know that in the big picture you are not important but what you make and do is
6368832 if you take them and really dont need them they dont hurt you
6368833 could i give a plein air lesson for a fee
6368834 embrace the heat and friction of life because it means youre in the game
6368835 childbirth without discomfort dulls the happiness of cradling your new born this goes for all areas of creativity
6368836 we do not need to ostracize the sufferers of depression by romanticizing this terrible illness but show the same compassion we would show anyone suffering from any other illness
6368837 there is a better word than happiness for the state you describe it is fulfillment which is a deep rich state of mind that implies connection and service to a goal one has set happy is only a mood fulfilled is a state of life
6368838 i remember when my father used to look sad or thoughtful mom would try to make him smile and he would say leave me alone i am enjoying the gloom
6368839 the phrase attitude of gratitude has become trite but it can be a very powerful mood booster
6368840 my key to self examination and possible happiness comes from not following other peoples lists
6368841 one never knows true happiness until one experiences true sadness
6368842 one must endure the pain to enjoy the wealth of happiness and joy
6368843 a host of golden daffodils a mountain stream or a robins nest on which to contemplate

6368846 mikael was a great servant and a wonderful professional we wish him all the best at his new club and thank him for his service
6368847 mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6368848 this scheme has properly been described as pseudo medical to pay lay people albeit briefly trained as stop smoking counsellors for recruiting and spending a few sessions with smokers is an astonishing way to spend public money
6368849 this was all driven by the need to meet targets and it is a feature of the target driven culture of the governments of this country that it can lead to the distortion of proper functions and can lead as in this case to the opportunity for fraud
6368850 we know that nhs stop smoking services have been hugely effective in helping people quit
6368851 a top intelligence official said the statements of huji leaders held with grenades suggest that pakistan based militant organisations sent several consignments of grenades to islamist militants in india via bangladesh

6368859 the last amount they attempted to withdraw was shs17 million
6368860 bank of uganda should help us to set up guidelines on exact identifications which can be used for instance in withdrawal of transferred money
6368861 our investigations have revealed that some rogues in the bank who are sent to put money in atms remove genuine notes and place in fake money so clients become victims
6368862 barclays bank is a responsible bank and it puts legal money in its atms
6368863 when you get us reports the bank will tell you to go to the security officer and the officer will tell you to go to the bank secretary which consumes a lot of time and you know justice delayed is justice denied
6368864 while we may not have exact causes of murders most of them are domestic related while others are committed while carrying out robberies
6368865 my appeal to the public is that they should know that murder may not solve the outstanding problems because there are other avenues of settling differences he said
6368866 they have created nightmares to the travelling public on the major roads leading to and from mbarara
6368867 its my belief that the future model for providing it infrastructure and services in large organizations will very much resemble what you describe and what many call cloud computing but will occur behind the firewall
6368868 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6368869 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6368870 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6368871 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6368872 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6368873 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun
6368874 conrad wants to play first team football and with two other good goalkeepers here i felt it would be best for both parties if he went out on loan and gained further experience
6368875 because as a pre proposal that wasnt bad but if it was a marriage proposal it kinda sucked in the romance department
6368876 i think we shall be very happy i havent any fears i think when friends marry they are safe we dont suffer like those young ones

6368880 everyone told me i would fail and that my concept of a gallery would not work in portsmouth
6368881 i had been managing a physical therapy clinic in massachusetts
6368882 but my love was art and i took all the art history classes i could take
6368883 when my father passed away and left me some money it was time to take this step
6368884 it was really a suburb of boston when my friend came to portsmouth and told me to check it out i did i have never looked back
6368885 about 60 percent of our sales are in art but we sell other things too like dishware and placemats t shirts
6368886 the design has to be good and with clean lines
6368887 i like to think we showcase the best of local artists but are not limited to the seacoast
6368888 i think people in portsmouth want to see whats out there
6368889 i think it works and it shows as we are still in business
6368890 it was the right time for this sort of gallery
6368891 the give and take is what makes us so special
6368892 if i had listened to all the naysayers i wouldnt be here today

6368920 it is probably true that in general the higher the education of the individual becomes the more their views are differentiated if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of outlook we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive and common taste prevail this does not mean that the majority of people have low moral standards it merely means that the largest group of people whose values are very similar are the people with low standards it is as it were the lowest common denominator which unites the largest number of people

6368934 effective 18 august 2008 grob aerospace gmbh in germany has been forced to file for insolvency
6368935 this unfortunate situation has arisen as a consequence of recent delays in the spn aircraft program resulting in the increased requirement for cash to see the program through to certification
6368936 under the circumstances our current loan provider has elected to discontinue their support
6368937 we continue to stand by our fleet purchase order of 25 grob spn aircraft
6368938 we believe that the grob spn is the best large cabin light jet to fulfill the needs of the planesense program participants

6368952 one of my colleagues used to work for a company that decided it needed to downsize the company took the bizarre step of announcing who would be laid off in stages with each announcement coming on a friday the 13th
6368953 this creates fear and tension among employees and also creates an us vs them mentality there werent any disasters on that occasion but its not hard to imagine tensions boiling over
6368954 if you need to lay this type of person off its important to be very explicit about why they were chosen and why this was a logical decision
6368955 if its because of economic reasons be very clear that its because of economic reasons
6368956 otherwise the tendency to believe theyre out to get me often takes over
6368957 one of the worst things you can do is create ambiguity
6368958 while the managers might think they are sparing feelings they are also giving ex employees an opportunity to spin conspiracy theories which fuel anger and resentment
6368959 be kind and respectful but also as candid as possible
6368960 a big problem with these reactions is that they dont always go away once the stress is reduced
6368961 people become addicted to alcohol or irreparably harm their reputation at work or their relationships with family members
6368962 fortunately the really dramatic stress related incidents like workplace shootings are rare
6368963 reducing bad stress often can be done by reducing bureaucracy and listening to employees concerns to see if they can be addressed
6368964 what you generally dont want to do is try to reduce employees overall stress levels by taking away the good stress the aspects of a job they find enjoyable and energizing

6368986 indeed the commissions obscuration of the ivir studies and its failure to confront the critical arguments made therein seem to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the parliament as well as the citizens of the european union in doing so the commission reinforces the suspicion already widely held by the public at large that its policies are less the product of a rational decision making process than of lobbying by stakeholders this is troublesome not only in the light of the current crisis of faith as regards the european lawmaking institutions but also and particularly so in view of european citizens increasingly critical attitudes towards intellectual property law

6369012 the american hotel industry and its millions of guests are going to be seriously affected by dojs new ada interpretation
6369013 the hundreds of millions in additional costs are going to be passed on to guests in the form of higher room and amenities rates doj must take into consideration our industrys observations and comments for it is our members who handle these issues on the ground every day
6369014 this issue is of utmost importance to our members and will have serious repercussions for many of them over the next decade
6369015 ah amp las members have spent billions of dollars in the last 16 years making their facilities accessible to individuals with disabilities in compliance with the ada they have done so not only because it is the law but because their mission is to make every guest feel comfortable and welcome
6369016 ensure that no political appointments will be made to overseas governmental positions
6369017 by securing the 2012 games for britain we have provided a once in a lifetime opportunity for our tourism industry it is now up to the industry to make the most of the games
6369018 dcms is being characteristically disingenuous in claiming they were responsible for securing the 2012 olympic games for london but arguing that tourism businesses should be responsible for destination marketing shows just how little the department responsible for tourism really understands the industry
6369019 the tourism industry the majority of which is made up of small businesses simply does not have the capacity or the expertise for the international marketing of the uk as a tourism destination
6369020 is it too much to expect that in return for the 2
6369021 the government must really understand that infrastructure will not boost tourism on its own if the world is unaware of the fantastic facilities here in the uk then they simply will not come and visit
6369022 we are absolutely delighted to be adding this new dornier 328jet to our fleet the 328 jet is extremely versatile rugged and just perfect for the various flying activities we perform
6369023 its cabin is generous and there really isnt another aircraft on the market today that is on a par when it comes to affordable operating costs too
6369024 we are very pleased to place aircraft no 3026 with welcome air which has been a dornier 328 customer since its formation in 1999 it is one of the last of the new build 328s to leave our hangar but we have a number of refurbishment and conversion programmes ongoing with used aircraft the 328 is proving a very popular type right now especially in these difficult economic times
6369025 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6369026 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6369027 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6369028 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6369029 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6369030 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6369031 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6369032 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6369033 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6369034 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6369035 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6369036 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6369037 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6369038 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6369039 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6369040 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6369041 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6369042 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6369043 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6369044 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6369045 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6369046 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6369047 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6369048 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6369049 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6369050 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6369051 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6369052 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6369053 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6369054 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6369055 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6369056 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6369057 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6369058 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6369059 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6369060 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6369061 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6369062 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6369063 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6369064 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6369065 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6369066 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6369067 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6369068 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6369069 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6369070 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6369071 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6369072 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6369073 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6369074 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6369075 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6369076 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6369077 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6369078 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6369079 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6369080 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6369081 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6369082 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6369083 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6369084 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6369085 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6369086 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6369087 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6369088 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6369089 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6369090 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6369091 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6369092 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6369093 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6369094 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6369095 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6369096 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6369097 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6369098 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6369099 there is no longer this widespread belief among the wise guys and gals of both parties that were all just sitting around waiting for this race to break in obamas direction the polls as well as the money race suggest otherwise
6369100 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6369101 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6369102 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6369103 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6369104 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6369105 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6369106 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6369107 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6369108 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6369109 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6369110 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6369111 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6369112 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6369113 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6369114 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6369115 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6369116 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6369117 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6369118 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6369119 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6369120 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6369121 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6369122 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6369123 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6369124 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6369125 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6369126 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6369127 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6369128 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6369129 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6369130 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6369131 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6369132 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6369133 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6369134 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6369135 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6369136 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6369137 andrew donley got injured against crichton last wednesday as did mark mcginley donley will be out for a week and mcginley could be two or three weeks and willie beattie got injured on saturday so hell be out for a week
6369138 from having four strikers were down to one but its a cup game so it gives us a wee chance to play some of the other boys
6369139 the pressures off from the league so we can relax a wee bit and see how things go
6369140 ill be changing the team a wee bit and playing the boys that havent been playing and are just back from injury in the cup games i feel there are too many cup games anyway there are four or five plus the challenge cup
6369141 we didnt concede any goals which was a good thing the boys played well wigtown looked a bit stuffier on paper than the last time and i thought our fitness told in the end we knocked it about quite well and it was a good result
6369142 we knew in the second half wed play a lot better with our fitness we had some good goals from all over the park with the two widemen and the fullback scoring and it was a good all round performance
6369143 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6369144 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6369145 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6369146 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6369147 there was nothing we could take from the game dalbeattie were much sharper than us and were fired up for it more than we were it was so disappointing
6369148 the first half was a total disaster we never got going and dalbeattie ran over the top of us
6369149 its not good enough we need to start taking responsibility for ourselves on the park
6369150 weve had two players sent off which is two too many in my eyes discipline last season wasnt very good and its one of the things weve tried to work on this season
6369151 both sendings off have been for two bookings but they miss the next game and its not helping the squad
6369152 we just need to know that when things arent going for us we should control the aggression and put it back into the game instead of making a rash challenge
6369153 we had seven boys missing on saturday but i dont want that to be an excuse we just need to try to get a consistent team on the park and start grinding out results we know we can do it we did it last season with basically the same squad
6369154 weve got a cup game and then stranraer fc in the league every games tough and weve just got to knuckle down grind out two or three results and take it from there
6369155 i think it takes a little bit of pressure off and weve just got to give it our all on the day newton had a good result last week but got beat on saturday so theyre struggling as well its a double header which makes it more intriguing hopefully well have a few boys back
6369156 its a winner takes all game and weve just got to go out dig in roll our sleeves up for 90 minutes and hopefully get a result
6369157 if we can win cup games we can hopefully move that into the league games and give ourselves a bit of confidence
6369158 its disappointing because we didnt apply ourselves right from the beginning and its another bad defeat to a big team we had this problem last year when we played the top teams and didnt get much out of it we just need to pick ourselves up and try to string together some results
6369159 we didnt start playing until the last half hour there wasnt a lot in the game our tempo was low we should have applied ourselves better and had more desire to win the game early doors
6369160 although they went 3 0 up i wouldnt say they were dominating the game in the whole first half they had two shots on goal and a cross
6369161 the cross was a bit slack from us and gary king tried to head it clear but it went in at the near post i think we were too flat and we were chasing the game
6369162 we went into the second half with a higher tempo and then we were caught on the break at 3 0 i thought it was done and dusted but we continued to play at a higher tempo and got two back
6369163 we pressurised them and they had a man sent off with ten minutes to go and we actually looked like wed get at least a draw but time just slipped away from us
6369164 if we dont get two or three players in were probably not strong enough to win the league this time but things can change in football even at this early stage it looks like cups will be our main objective
6369165 were two maybe three players off the finished article and its not easy to get them in weve been trying and trying something might develop with teams who have a lot of players and theyre maybe not getting a game
6369166 i still think the team weve got are more than capable of giving anyone a game and if they apply themselves from the start rather than halfway through the game
6369167 i think a lot of the boys will be looking for a bit of payback
6369168 abbey vale have improved and thoroughly deserved their victory but i think itll be a different story
6369169 well be a tougher proposition than we were then and we were missing eight players
6369170 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6369171 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6369172 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6369173 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6369174 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6369175 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6369176 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6369177 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6369178 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6369179 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6369180 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6369181 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6369182 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6369183 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6369184 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6369185 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6369186 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6369187 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6369188 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6369189 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6369190 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6369191 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6369192 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6369193 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6369194 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6369195 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6369196 they told me there are going to be resources here
6369197 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6369198 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6369199 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6369200 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6369201 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6369202 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6369203 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6369204 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6369205 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6369206 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6369207 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6369208 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6369209 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6369210 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply

6369214 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6369215 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6369216 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6369217 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6369218 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6369219 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6369220 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6369221 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6369222 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6369223 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6369224 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6369226 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6369227 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6369228 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges

6369230 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together

6369235 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6369236 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6369237 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6369238 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6369239 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6369240 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6369241 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6369242 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6369243 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6369244 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6369245 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6369246 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6369247 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6369248 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6369249 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6369250 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6369251 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6369252 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6369253 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6369254 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6369255 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6369256 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6369257 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6369258 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6369259 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6369260 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6369261 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6369262 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6369263 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6369264 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6369265 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6369266 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6369267 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6369268 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6369269 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6369270 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6369271 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6369272 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6369273 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6369274 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6369275 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6369276 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6369277 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power

6369279 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6369280 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6369281 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6369282 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6369283 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6369284 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6369285 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6369286 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6369287 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6369288 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

6369292 it was an animal path that became a major indian trail
6369293 it was used for communications between villages for hunting for trading and for diplomacy
6369294 trinity lutheran held its first services in a log church very close to where the marker will stand
6369295 the land along those indian paths was prime commercial real estate
6369296 they were often the first areas to see population growth and development
6369297 what i like about the marker program is that markers raise historical awareness in the region history is not just something that happened in philadelphia or boston
6369298 i think the markers are especially important in smaller towns where local people often dont realize that something of national significance happened here
6369299 residents realize that a local person someone from their home town did something great
6369300 the markers are educational for travelers passing through who can learn something about the history of pennsylvania but they are more meaningful for local folks who can take pride in their history
6369301 we bring you the revenue from your outstanding receivables and make that available to the district immediately

6369310 we know that the monetary policy committee is currently placing more weight on the anecdotal and survey evidence than the official sales figures
6369311 i think we are going to see further weakness in retail sales going forward you will see official retail sales match up with survey evidence
6369312 the trend is your friend and it is very much downward i think in assessing the strength of consumer spending we have to take everything into account and it all points to doom and gloom
6369313 this coupled with worries about further utility bill price hikes could keep inflation at the 5 level for longer than many had hoped and lead us to doubt the prospect of a november rate cut that several analysts have been expecting nonetheless with the retail sector remaining vulnerable to rising unemployment negative wage growth the credit crunch rate cuts will still happen it is just that we believe first quarter of 2009 is a more probable start time
6369314 the mix in retail sales is as before with bigger ticket housing related sales doing badly and smaller ticket items doing well supported by tourist sales in central london despite an intensifying squeeze on household budgets the uk consumer is down but by no means out
6369315 this is an environment where we are seeing heavy investment to win sales and eyes are beginning to turn to the peak christmas trading period ahead this is when we will see the real winners and losers consumer spending is shifting and while we are already seeing those with clear propositions at the top and bottom of the sector doing well it is in the mid market where the real battle will be fought out only those who can positively differentiate what they are offering to the shopper will be in the list of winners come january

6369317 due to its oral activity and plausible long term durable response rate seen in ra patients in the initial multi center placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial oral dnajp1 may have an important clinical advantage over current injectable ra treatments which have significant toxicities our preliminary studies also strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of dnajp1 is complementary to current biologics thus providing the opportunity to develop combination therapies which may improve currently used regimens the long term statistically significant improvement in clinical scores as seen by acr20 and acr50 following cessation of drug therapy further suggests that this technology may be inducing a tolerogenic response
6369318 we are pleased to have broadened our therapeutic pipeline of products with the acquisition of this innovative program oral dnajp1 certainly complements our existing clinical stage immunology programs which include trimesta our oral phase ii iii clinical program in multiple sclerosis and our cd4 inhibitor technology we have been equally impressed with the rigor and quality of the scientific data along with the level of grant funding this program has received over the years from the nih we look forward to reporting additional clinical data from this study later this year

6369326 subtle alterations in the microanatomy of tissue compartments and specific subanatomic distribution of inflammatory cells will be most easily and accurately identified in the foreseeable future by the eyes and brains of skilled and experienced practitioners of histopathology the acquisition and judicious application of such skills will ensure the maintenance of the traditional aspects of anatomic pathology even in the molecular and digital era of medicine

6369328 to not have access to the river or the views was a waste the bridge has brought all that into play you need to make a bold statement the bridge makes that bold statement
6369329 it was seen as part of a package of regeneration it wasnt seen entirely as a transport project
6369330 it is one view of the area that people photograph
6369331 the image of the bridge is a very striking image it is very widely used on publicity photographs and on all sorts of tourist mementoes the bridge is integral it is such a unique design it doesnt look like any other bridge
6369332 the bridge was a landmark of this area and this ancient bridge was very well known all around the world destroying a bridge was a signal of the destroying of our connections and our past to reconstruct the bridge the idea was to reconstruct our connections

6369359 despite the attention that stem cell research has received most of the work has been restricted to biological approaches
6369360 for those discoveries to go from the test tube into treatments that heal injuries and cure diseases we will need to equip a broad range of scientists and engineers with stem cell knowledge and expertise
6369361 with this nsf support rutgers will prepare more students to conduct breakthrough research that reveals new knowledge in fundamental biology and accelerates the use of stem cells in the treatment of debilitating injuries and diseases
6369362 it will boost our standing as one of the worlds top universities for stem cell research and training
6369363 by broadening the scope of stem cell research to encompass molecular biosciences engineering and physical sciences the grant will strengthen our efforts to find cures for brain and spinal cord injuries and disorders

6369393 the international condemnation of russian aggression against georgia and the concomitant assaults by abkhazians and south ossetians against ethnic georgians within their territories is in large part appropriate but the self righteous posturing coming out of washington should be tempered by a sober recognition of the ways in which the united states has contributed to the crisis it has been nearly impossible to even broach this subject of the u s role much of the mainstream media coverage and statements by american political leaders of both major parties has in many respects resembled the anti russian hysterics of the cold war it is striking how quickly forgotten is the fact that the u s backed georgian military started the war when it brutally assaulted the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali in an attempt to regain direct control of the autonomous region

6369417 el proceso en el que nos encontramos ahora es el de identificaci n que es un proceso bastante m s lento y que lo est realizando el departamento cient fico de la guardia civil

6369445 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6369446 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6369447 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6369448 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6369449 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6369450 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what stands for and believes in
6369451 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6369452 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6369453 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6369454 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6369455 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6369456 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6369457 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6369458 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6369459 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester

6369464 and i want to try some new events thats whats keeping me going
6369465 i am going to london to do the handover for the next olympics
6369466 and hopefully prepare myself the way i did for these games and be ready to compete in london
6369467 id like to say on behalf of the people of india that we wish her well and our prayers are with her
6369468 its so sad for someone so young to be diagnosed with such a dreadful illness its horrible
6369469 people had started to see a different side to jade it was unbelievable to see the change in her
6369470 it was interesting to see she had put in the effort to curb her aggressive streak she was much calmer
6369471 this is not a copy of a pc on tv
6369472 we are setting a new bar and delivering a richer internet experience to tv like never before
6369473 who shot jr beam me up scotty youre fired and good night and good luck you know these lines better than i do
6369474 i dont have to name the show or the stars why because we all want and we all love tv
6369475 in the past the idea was to put the browser on tv and use a text based interface which would interfere with the programme
6369476 this leaves the user in the environment they are comfortable with which is watching tv
6369477 companies still spend five times as much ad money on the tv as the web
6369478 advertising is sold more effectively on tv the problem with tv is that everyone sees the same ad
6369479 it puts tv not on an even footing with the internet as a mass medium but it could potentially leapfrog it because of the improved dynamic of the big screen audio experience
6369480 up until now there has been no consistent architecture to do this well
6369481 no de facto platform to fuse the internet with tv
6369482 for the first time we are bringing the full richness of the internet and web 2 0 and optimising the tv while respecting the tvs unique attributes simplicity easy of use socialising and entertainment value all the things that people love about tv
6369483 if you look at these things what they boil down to is is it compelling to use am i as a consumer going to sit on my couch with my very expensive tv and think wow i really want to go and look at the weather
6369484 as we have seen a lot of people are doing that with their laptop on their knee during the olympics or the superbowl which is inconvenient and involves just one person
6369485 so getting to the stage where you can bring some of that functionality to the tv without it being disruptive to the viewing experience is what has been missing to date
6369486 then we dont have any choice but to hold protest rallies

6369488 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6369489 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6369490 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6369491 that means any campaign to reduce teen pregnancy must also become a campaign to reduce the unacceptable levels of violence against girls and to give all girls the opportunity to realize their full personhood equality dignity and worth

6369510 it is a pleasure to go out there under pressure to perform that is what you are expected to do at this level whenever you have the responsibility whenever you have the pressure they expect you to score
6369511 it is a privilege to have a player like badrinath he played the first game and he had pressure of scoring those runs but did it very well that is what gives you more confidence more experience you dont have to get the experience of playing 100 games if you play 25 of such games it will give you the experience of 45 or 50 games

6369577 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6369578 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6369579 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6369580 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6369581 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6369582 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6369583 as he gets older physically more mature he can only get faster
6369584 swimming isnt as visible in this part of the country as say florida and south california and texas
6369585 there are a number of teams in new england we are going to be pushing the problem that we all face in this area is the challenge of pool space it would be great if we could use this as a launch off to keep pools open or make more
6369586 one year after the olympics we had our tryout for the lesson program which basically is learning about the sport
6369587 we had a line outside the pool and in the lobby and into the parking lot over 100 kids tried out that day
6369588 its the success a lot of good athletes just tend to gravitate toward swimming because of the success if you get a bunch of new people to try out and even half of them decide its not for them you have more people on the team that wouldnt have tried if it wasnt for the olympics
6369589 swimming is not necessarily looked on as a mainstream boys sports
6369590 phelps has given validity to the masculine aspect of the sport hes incredibly in shape and athletic even the basketball team was there rooting him on hes definitely been positive for the visibility of the sport
6369591 i think michael phelps that name will last a long time in the mainstream
6369592 i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6369593 i lost i dont know what to say my dreams are crushed
6369594 i think with more experience on these top levels as we continue to play against the best teams in the world on a consistent basis thats whats really going to continue to develop this team and this program
6369595 is it real is it real did i really win gold
6369596 its to everyone out there that you have to work hard
6369597 we waited four years for this gold and a whole row of 10s was our crowning achievement
6369598 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6369599 even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
6369600 so for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive
6369601 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6369602 senator obamas position in the illinois senate was to oppose any legislation that would protect such innocent life everyone else was clear that the bill addressed infanticide not abortion

6369628 the justice department filed papers in court late monday asking a federal judge to temporarily set aside his own order directing white house officials to testify before congress about the firings of nine u s attorneys
6369629 the filing was in response to a july 31 opinion by u
6369630 the bush administration action indicates that despite recent correspondence to congress suggesting otherwise it is still strongly resisting subpoenas of white house officials to testify about the politically sensitive issue of the firings of the u s attorneys
6369631 the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that former white house counsel harriett miers one of those subpoenaed is absolutely immune from compelled testimony
6369632 in the past the supreme court had reserved claims by presidents of absolute immunity only for
6369633 in february the house of representatives voted 223 32 to hold miers and white house chief of staff joshua bolten in contempt of congress for refusing to testify and provide documents about the u
6369634 the appeal by the justice department suggests however that the bush administration at a minimum is attempting to obtain a stronger negotiating position with congress if not entirely delay compliance with congressional subpoenas until next year

6369650 ich habe mich so gefreut an dem tag gab es auch keine medaillen f r deutsche sportler das war mein gl ck und so durfte ich als f nfte sogar zu beckmanns olympia nacht die medien haben so positiv berichtet weil ich mich so gefreut habe eine almsick h tte man wegen eines f nften platzes verh hnt
6369651 wenn der sportler zeigt wie viel die eigene leistung wert ist wissen die medien das auch wertzusch tzen und wenn die dann mitspielen und dich pushen dann w rden die leute viel mehr ahnung haben und auch den sport fter gucken die medien haben es in der hand
6369652 genauso professionell wie ein fu baller tennisspieler oder 100 meter l ufer aber geher stehen nicht so im mittelpunkt
6369653 aber wenn ein weitspringer bertritt gilt der sprung auch nicht und der geher wird ja vorher auch mehrfach gewarnt
6369654 man kann so viele verwarnungen bekommen wie man will aber entscheidend sind die antr ge bei drei antr gen ist schluss die m ssen aber von drei verschiedenen wettkampfrichtern gegeben werden
6369655 wenn man einmal mitgemacht hat will man immer wieder hin die ganze welt schaut zu alle sportarten finden zusammen statt das ist was ganz besonderes man hat die chance sich die anderen disziplinen anzuschauen
6369656 im olympischen dorf muss man die olympiakleidung des landes tragen dadurch erkennt man sich das ist toll man lernt so viele leute kennen und ist nie alleine
6369657 few locations in the united states can match the selection of premium used equipment our spartanburg facility offers in one place
6369658 this entire location is dedicated to facilitating the resale of premium kenworth and peterbilt used trucks from pfc customers all across the united states thats how we can offer truck operators and their dealers hundreds of late model trucks from which to choose
6369659 with this on site service shop customers and their truck dealers can be assured theyre getting premium used trucks that have been reconditioned to paccars high quality standards
6369660 paccar dealers can also send their used truck sales staff here to receive extensive hands on training
6369661 en l tat de nos informations trois fran ais sont d c d s
6369662 nous restons en contact avec les autorit s espagnoles pour d terminer si dautres fran ais auraient pu tre pr sents sur le vol
6369663 es ist einfacher in peking zu schwimmen als hier durchzukommen
6369664 das ist der gr te erfolg in der geschichte des klubs
6369665 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6369666 weve got to get better because you never stay the same you get better or worse
6369667 they were good last year and gave us everything we wanted last year with a backup quarterback
6369668 hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6369669 so we cant do anything about that we have to get better as a team without him
6369670 im not saying i went out there and every run was the best i ran hard and did the best with the carries i had but i still have room to get better
6369671 i like days like this quiet no whiners we get to play cards in peace
6369672 yeah that was a great idea you had dont feed or water them and they dont poop or pee
6369673 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6369674 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6369675 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6369676 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6369677 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6369678 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6369679 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6369680 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6369681 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6369682 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6369683 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6369684 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6369685 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6369686 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6369687 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6369688 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6369689 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6369690 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6369691 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6369692 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6369693 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6369694 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6369695 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6369696 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6369697 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6369698 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6369699 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6369700 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6369701 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6369702 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6369703 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6369704 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6369705 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6369706 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6369707 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6369708 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6369709 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6369710 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6369711 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6369712 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6369713 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6369714 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6369715 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6369716 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6369717 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6369718 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6369719 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6369720 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6369721 niemand heeft de paus toestemming gegeven tegen newmans wensen in te gaan
6369722 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6369723 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6369724 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6369725 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6369726 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6369727 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6369728 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6369729 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6369730 i had four new tires and they were all tight i knew that we would be able to get there if we didnt wreck when i went three wide down the backstretch for third and disposed of travis benjamin and trevor sanborn thats when i knew this race was over and they needed to get out of my way
6369731 i knew that he had a good car but i also knew that there was no way he would beat me on that restart
6369732 when we got back up there johnny was on a rail so i dont know if we had anything for him but it was good to at least get there to battle for one lap so im happy with what we did
6369733 there was a lot of pressure on me tonight a lot of people came out to watch me and i had high expectations i was doing my best to try and get that win but it was still good to get second its good to be home and to know that we have that much support behind us that is a good feeling and i had a great time
6369734 my husband was the one who originally signed up but he had a mountain biking accident late june and broke both of his arms so he was unable to compete i figured i would give it a shot and take my husbands place
6369735 since i did not have much time to train i decided my goal would be to finish
6369736 i took my time and enjoyed the scenery im not sure if that 2 06 51 is a good time or not but im happy that i finished
6369737 im not sure if i will do another tri or not if i were to i would definitely concentrate on the swimming piece of it the swim was the toughest part since i am not much of a swimmer
6369738 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
6369739 what edwards really wants to do right now is concentrate on his family
6369740 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies for big oil
6369741 suspension of the rules is not the way to consider energy issues
6369742 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6369743 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6369744 the ugandan army bombed the herders in a bid to flush them out the bombing and shooting has been going on for last the 24 hours
6369745 bombing kenyans for what thats a rumour and as of now we are not using any helicopter
6369746 we should expect the kenyan army to complain not a politician because we monitor movement of cattle rustlers jointly
6369747 i will fly to kakuma and then drive for five hours to the area to get first hand information
6369748 we thought we would negotiate under the spirit of the east africa community
6369749 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6369750 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6369751 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6369752 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6369753 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6369754 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6369755 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6369756 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6369757 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6369758 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6369759 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6369760 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6369761 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6369762 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6369763 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6369764 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6369765 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6369766 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6369767 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6369768 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6369769 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6369770 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6369771 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6369772 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6369773 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6369774 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6369775 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6369776 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6369777 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6369778 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6369779 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6369780 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6369781 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6369782 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6369783 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6369784 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6369785 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6369786 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6369787 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6369788 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6369789 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6369790 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6369791 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6369792 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6369793 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6369794 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6369795 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6369796 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6369797 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6369798 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6369799 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6369800 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6369801 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6369802 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6369803 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6369804 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6369805 right now i have nothing until we go to florida and attempt a few outdoor records
6369806 at my age group i know i can get them
6369807 im waiting to see what someone in germany russia or sweden will do
6369808 theyre all old oympians and their season starts later theyll be trying to break my record then ill have to start all over and just throw farther
6369809 i paint seascapes still life lobster boats and anything that the tourists would want
6369810 its been making me a living for the past 50 years
6369811 i work on my turns and get my rhythm down at my age you need the rhythm to get the turns right
6369812 but i have a little bell on the door to let me know when people come in
6369813 i still compete because it makes me feel like im still young
6369814 i work out every night at the gym and the pool you have to keep at it the older you get
6369815 i pull 100 pounds in five sets of 30 the main thing is to keep your pulling muscles strong thats what you use to throw
6369816 they gloss over the fact that a 101 year old buster martin completed the london marathon in just over 10 hours and he stopped for a pint along the way thats the greatest athletic achievement in this century and they didnt invite him to beijing for a lap or anything
6369817 the masters track and field competitions is a cinderella group all over the world
6369818 many are old olympians who want to hang in but other than friends and family theres nobody there to see them compete
6369819 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6369820 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6369821 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6369822 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6369823 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6369824 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6369825 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6369826 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6369827 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6369828 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6369829 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6369830 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6369831 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6369832 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6369833 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6369834 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6369835 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6369836 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6369837 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6369838 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6369839 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6369840 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6369841 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6369842 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6369843 what will i do if i didnt get promoted within one to two years
6369844 how and where do i see myself five years from now
6369845 qualche minuto dopo essere entrato nella stanza anton mi ha chiesto potresti farci vedere come ti muovi
6369846 sapevo che sarebbe successo perch avevo visto un paio di attori prima di me dalla finestra e quindi ero andato di corsa in bagno ed avevo provato i movimenti davanti allo specchio mi hanno attaccato al braccio e anton ha mimato qualche passo per aiutarmi a calarmi nella parte
6369847 la prima cosa che mi chiedevano tutti era come mi sentissi allidea di interpretare una leggenda
6369848 so che cos che la gente lo vede ma io non volevo pensare a lui in questo modo non puoi interpretare una leggenda senza mettere una certa pomposit nel ruolo mentre lui era una persona normale un ragazzo come tanti e stata solo la sua morte cos prematura a fare di lui un mito che continua ad affascinare la gente
6369849 basically i was trying to get her to lie down while we ate dinner
6369850 i got involved just because i brought my dog to be trained
6369851 but then i loved it so much i wanted to do more
6369852 for a lot of people its kind of their outlet with their dogs from the everyday world
6369853 six weeks of training is not going to be all someone wants to do
6369854 usually they do at least two sessions and a lot of people get hooked
6369855 its more like play and exposing them to different kinds of environments and socialization
6369856 dogs really enjoy it no matter what age they are
6369857 i tell people you want a dog that makes you happy without making other people unhappy
6369858 they naturally will jump up and bark we teach them to become good citizens and good members of the family
6369859 builds that basic relationship between a person and their dog
6369860 its a lot easier to make a puppy lie down than it is a 60 to 80 pound dog
6369861 we have a lot of dogs that come to us when theyre teenagers around seven to eight months old
6369862 thats when the dogs start showing their independence when puppies are little they stay closer to you but as they get older they start wandering
6369863 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6369864 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6369865 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6369866 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6369867 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6369868 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6369869 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6369870 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6369871 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6369872 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6369873 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6369874 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6369875 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6369876 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6369877 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6369878 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6369879 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6369880 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6369881 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6369882 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6369883 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6369884 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6369885 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6369886 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6369887 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6369888 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6369889 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6369890 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6369891 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6369892 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6369893 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6369894 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6369895 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6369896 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6369897 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6369898 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6369899 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6369926 games have changed and so have their players but the theory remains the same at a time when poker is more popular than ever the messages in the anecdotes are sure to ring true
6369927 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states

6369944 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6369945 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6369946 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6369947 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6369948 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6369949 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6369950 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6369951 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6369952 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6369954 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6369955 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6369956 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6369957 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6369958 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6369959 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6369960 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6369961 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6369962 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6369963 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6369964 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6369965 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

6369973 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest

6369983 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
6369984 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
6369985 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
6369986 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
6369987 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
6369988 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
6369989 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
6369990 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
6369991 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favourite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
6369992 ya syakira kami ini orang arab dari tanah arab kami tahu hal yang sebenarnya terjadi

6369995 puak puak syiah membunuh kami orang orang sunnah mereka bukan membunuh secara biasa tetapi mereka menyeksa kami dengan seksaan yang dahsyat mereka mencungkil mata kami menggerudi tubuh kami sehingga kami mati
6369996 tidak mereka bukan muslim asalnya mereka adalah agama dari parsi
6369997 di hadapan kamu mereka mengaku mereka muslim tetapi pada hakikatnya mereka ingin menghancurkan islam mereka ingin menghancurkan al quran mereka ingin menghancurkan sunnah mereka menolak nabi muhammad sallahu alaihi wa sallam
6369998 mereka menutup isu ini daripada pengetahuan umum dahulunya banyak puak sunni yang tinggal di iraq tetapi sekarang sudah semakin berkurang kerana mereka membunuh kami setiap hari cuba kamu bayangkan kami berjiran dengan syiah lalu mereka masuk ke dalam rumah kami dan menyeksa kami sebelum membunuh kanak kanak orang tua dan semua orang orang sunni sehinggakan kami sangat takut untuk mengaku kami ini sunni di hadapan mereka hatta sekarang kemudahan air puak sunni sedang dipotong oleh mereka
6369999 mereka kata saddam hussein itu zalim sedangkan hak hak mereka telah saddam penuhi dia memberi kemudahan dan kedudukan kepada mereka tapi akhirnya mereka mendakwa saddam tidak memberikan mereka hak apa pun saddam berpemikiran tentera walaupun dia tidak begitu islamic tetapi dia tetap golongan sunni
