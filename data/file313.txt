3130009 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

3130057 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3130058 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important that visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3130059 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3130060 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3130061 further studies into the behavioral hormonal or biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying these differential metabolic responses to body size are needed and will likely further the identification of possible obesity intervention targets and improve cardiovascular disease screening tools
3130062 both reports emphasize the benign nature of fat accumulation outside the abdomen
3130063 in both studies the detrimental effect of visceral fat accumulation and its surrogate waist circumference were clearly demonstrated confirming older studies showing that waist circumference is a risk factor even in normal weight individuals

3130108 significant cash generated by high gold prices the monetization of components of its royalty and equity portfolio and an earlier bond issuance have permitted newmont to maintain credit measures that are in line with the rating while continuing to fund its large ongoing capital expenditure program
3130109 still we remain concerned that operating and capital cost increases could pressure the companys strong credit profile in the near to intermediate term
3130110 the lower corporate credit rating reflects our increasing concerns that the ongoing housing downturn will significantly erode the companys end market demand and credit measures over the next several quarters

3130119 technically we are like the spanish players though we dont play in the same style as them
3130120 im very confident we have the skill and the spirit to qualify we have grown with every friendly so far
3130121 for us the opponents not important the important thing is what we do
3130122 we will qualify for the world cup in south africa i am sure of it
3130123 i watched some games live and saw the rest on tv
3130124 only spain played in a different style only the characteristics of their play was different but i have a lot of confidence in my team and i think we will be ok
3130125 the level at the euros was good we have that same level or better
3130126 i must transmit the spirit of those teams to the players to play with confidence in our four games so far step by step we have been getting better
3130127 i will announce the captain the day before the game
3130128 arsenal always wants to play champions league and i think arsenal needs to play champions league
3130129 if you have players like this good players big stadium then i think you need to play in the highest league in europe
3130130 but this is football if you dont win two games then you dont qualify and we play uefa cup
3130131 i know them quite well as i have dutch satellite
3130132 it was quite though a big shock because in holland everyone expected ajax to win and in the end twente played better and these things happen in football
3130133 they had a great year last year but they lost two of their best playmakers karim el ahmadi and orlando engelaar however they got theo janssen from vitesse so they are still in good shape with a good team
3130134 they are really happy with him and almost proud to have him because it was quite a strange move to come from england manager to twente
3130135 it was a controlled environment you couldnt go down the hallway without someone knowing
3130136 so just who will be the winners and losers from the housing crash
3130137 in the classic 1980s film trading places two of the worlds most important businessmen find themselves on opposite ends of the nature versus nurture debate in order to settle a one dollar bet they put one rich stockbroker on the street and promote a homeless man into his position the aim is to see if the beggar can thrive from such lowly roots and the well bred stockbroker recover his fortune a nature versus nurture experiment is also under way at two of the worlds most powerful central banks ben bernanke the chairman of the united states federal reserve firmly believes in the need for nurture he has slashed interest rates in the us over the past year while his counterparts at the us treasury have joined in by pumping out tax rebates in an attempt to help the flailing us economy at the bank of england meanwhile the governor mervyn king appears to have placed his faith in nature last week the banks monetary policy committee kept interest rates on hold and when king unveils the committees latest assessment of the economy in the quarterly inflation report on wednesday he is likely to stress that rate cuts remain firmly off the agenda despite their radically different approaches both bernanke and king still seem to expect a similar outcome for their respective economies sure a period of lacklustre growth may be in prospect but their best guess is that before too long this will be followed by a perky rebound in activity indeed in the last inflation report the bank of england forecast that by the end of next year the uk should be cruising along at a similar pace to that seen during the golden years of the past decade all of which presents something of a puzzle what makes the bank of england unlike the federal reserve believe that its economy can navigate its own way back to the path of economic recovery a key difference between the banks and feds views relates to the impact of falling house prices a long standing belief at the bank of england has been that a collapsing housing market wont necessarily spill over into the real economy the argument goes that those planning to trade down may lose out as house prices tumble but those trading up in the future gain like in the movie theyre simply trading places this argument provides an intellectual slap in the face to those doom mongers who proclaim that housing market meltdown spells armageddon for the wider uk economy but theres just one problem the reality isnt quite as straightforward as the theory might suggest

3130141 in both canada and the united states general health insurance covers medical payment for eye injury and various eye diseases such as cataract glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy and optional vision insurance provides additional insurance coverage for eye examinations contact lenses and eyeglasses and or frames and in some instances part of the costs for elective laser surgery for vision correction
3130142 many americans and canadians have publicly funded or private coverage for optional vision care
3130143 the difference in use of eye care services between americans without health insurance and canadians narrowed when adjusted for income level and was almost eliminated when adjusted for having optional vision insurance
3130144 among adults with vision problems a public health gap exists in actual access to eye care services between canada and the united states primarily owing to the population without health insurance in the united states
3130145 however although health insurance is associated with increased use of preventive services and recommended treatments simply providing health insurance to all persons may be insufficient to increase the percentage of individuals who use eye care services or to improve vision related outcomes economic status and optional vision insurance are also significantly associated with rates of use of eye care services
3130146 therefore public health interventions targeting adults with vision problems without health insurance might be more beneficial if they focused on those at risk for serious vision loss especially those in the lowest income group
3130147 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3130148 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3130149 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect
3130150 the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and this epidemic is accompanied by a high incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease
3130151 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3130152 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3130153 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3130154 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities

3130156 both reports emphasize the benign nature of fat accumulation outside the abdomen
3130157 in both studies the detrimental effect of visceral fat accumulation and its surrogate waist circumference were clearly demonstrated confirming older studies showing that waist circumference is a risk factor even in normal weight individuals
3130158 this study supports the use of 11c pib pet in the evaluation of beta amyloid deposition in for example mild cognitive impairment alzheimers disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus
3130159 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether 11c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of 11c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation
3130160 we looked at figures nationwide and we found that use of the therapy was extremely variable
3130161 basically a lot of people who should be getting the therapy arent and some of the people who are getting it may not need it
3130162 our findings parallel previous studies evaluating adoption of new medical technology in that they show racial disparity in who is receiving the newest therapies
3130163 in contrast to previous studies however we didnt find any gender gap in the use of crt
3130164 crt is an effective therapy for many patients and this study suggests clinically practice varies greatly compared to what it should be according to recommended guidelines
3130165 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3130166 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3130167 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3130168 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3130169 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3130170 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3130171 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3130172 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3130173 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3130174 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
3130175 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
3130176 the higher levels among controls translate into important differences in overall daily functional limitations
3130177 disability and survival curves continued to diverge between groups after the 21 year follow up as participants approached their ninth decade of life
3130178 our findings of decreased disability in addition to prolonged survival among middle aged and older adults participating in routine physical activities further support recommendations to encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity at all ages
3130179 increasing healthy lifestyle behaviors may not only improve length and quality of life but also hopefully lead to reduced health care expenditures associated with disability and chronic diseases
3130180 i should be there by now did i make the wrong turn
3130181 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3130182 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3130183 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3130184 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3130185 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3130186 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3130187 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3130188 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
3130189 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3130190 future studies of this kind may illuminate the question of how we form an intuitive sense of the solidity of a belief how we distinguish fact from fiction itself
3130191 in conclusion the lowest 25 oh d quartile less than 17 8 nanograms per milliliter is associated with a higher risk of all cause mortality in the general u s population
3130192 further observational studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the mechanisms underlying these observations if confirmed randomized clinical trials will be needed to determine whether vitamin d supplementation at higher doses could have any potential benefit in reducing future mortality risk in those with 25 oh d deficiency
3130193 refractive error is therefore the most common condition affecting the ocular health of the u s population involving young adults middle aged persons and older adults of all ethnicities
3130194 accurate current estimates of the prevalence of refractive error are essential for projecting vision care needs and planning for provision of vision care services to the many people affected
3130195 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3130196 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3130197 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3130198 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia
3130199 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3130200 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3130201 we know that deaths come one to a customer eventually we will have a 100 percent mortality rate in both groups

3130205 tomorrow is the 62nd anniversary of the atomic bomb fat man being dropped on nagasaki japan
3130206 we are a young team progressing right now we had several players log major minutes last season guys like manny harris deshawn sims and kelvin grady guys that we feel will be a big part of this team then there are the others who have never really played signifi cant minutes zack gibson laval lucas perry and ben cronin just to name a few they are going to have play and gain experience early if you look at our roster we lost one senior were still going to be a young team
3130207 he really understands some of the things he has to do he was one of the most improved players in the country going from one or two points a game to 12 points a game not many people jump 10 points he will be working on some things consistency and some different things that are very important to him i sense that he his extremely excited about the opportunity that is in front of him right now to lead our team
3130208 we lost 22 games we were so inexperienced forget the schedule forget the system forget the new coach we were young playing the tough schedule its attractive to do it sometimes and it is going to help us in the long run but in the short term that will be the biggest difference this season there were some things learned on a daily basis whether it is a practice drill how to travel or a kid understanding how to eat properly we were young in so many different areas that only experience can teach we have some of that now we are able to move slightly forward and we will continue to keep doing that
3130209 generally in college basketball if you look at most kids from freshmen to juniors and even seniors no matter where they are playing there is a world of difference so that will be the big thing we will have to have more than just four coaches teaching we expect that deshawn manny kelvin zack and jevohn shepherd to be substitute teachers for us when we are not out there it will be a group effort
3130210 it will be the same thing if we get better everyday were going to accomplish our goals we want to have consistent progress towards postseason play using every day to get closer to playing in march for as long as we can
3130211 the sophomore year is a very diffi cult year for an outstanding freshman because they are marked men he had a great year so he will be a marked man there will be diffi cult moments that because he has some experience he will expect himself to play beyond his years and he is still probably the youngest sophomore in the country people have to be very careful and understand that with his age and his freshman year it was extremely unique he was forced to play major minutes forced to play through mistakes in the long run it will be good but i want to be careful that people dont expect too much he is still evolving everyday as a basketball player
3130212 we agree with ekpes udoh departure we are very hopeful that the new players will evolve to have some signifi cant role on the team whether its off the bench whether its starting whether its something thats our hope when you lose two of your top eight ekpe and ron coleman you are only trying to replace two but we are hopeful that they can come in and contribute if its only one or two thats fi ne but we are very hopeful that all of them will be able to fi ll some roles that were needed for a team that was last in the league in three point shooting we have some needs for a team that just lost its center we have some needs you cant forget about eric puls and jevohn those are guys that have been waiting to play and they very well could get a heck of a chance
3130213 oh yeah they have to i expect them to we need to shoot the ball better if you cant shoot the ball in the big ten it is going to be very difficult to win in the big ten very difficult
3130214 i was really encouraged by the crowds that we saw when we went on the road the excitement in the arenas and things like that ive been in many many venues but i thought that the big ten as far as a college basketball atmosphere it was as good if not better than anything i have ever seen for the level of coaching i would say the same thing it will be a challenge
3130215 i did indicate to him that i know it isnt your fault

3130300 traditional photo ops and political strategy has to do with conveying a sense of local flavor

3130302 the set is the same every night but the theater is always a little different

3130322 they have a lot of big commitments to huge advertisers what else were they going to do
3130323 i dont think there is a corporate halo that carries over because i liked the olympics on nbc i will watch nbc programming i dont think it works that way

3130606 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3130607 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3130608 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3130609 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3130610 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3130611 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3130612 so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3130613 the key facilitator in the provision of equipment money and foreign fighters to extremist operations and coordinated the actions of individual insurgent cells
3130614 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
3130615 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorizing their emplacement across the province he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12
3130616 there was mullah abdul shukur the taliban governor of kandahar mullah kamran the chief of police mullah baaz mohammad chief of intelligence mullah sayed wali head of the bank mullah qader commander of the air force and mullah mohib commander from spin boldak
3130617 were just beginning to see where this will lead but it marks an overall shift in how things are going to be done in the mobile environment
3130618 we understand what were up against we have plans in place and will be right sizing accordingly but are in no way done with this fire we are here for the long haul as long as were needed
3130619 not at the present moment but we will continue tomorrow
3130620 we had a long night negotiating on some little hurdles and i thought i should raise my fist but he mbeki remained cool and said let us continue talking
3130621 it looks like we have reached some kind of stalemate which is threatening the whole dialogue
3130622 tsvangirai is moving goal posts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon
3130623 this is an issue that we had settled and he tsvangirai is also suggesting that he must be given full authority to appoint any new government
3130624 the major hold up is the refusal by mugabe to cede his executive powers he is only agreeing to a nominal prime minister post for morgan tsvangirai
3130625 they zanu pf are also insisting that mutambara becomes one of the deputy prime ministers obviously that is not acceptable to us
3130626 the president will provide a statement in the rose garden at 5 15 p m today
3130627 the president has been getting regular updates on the situation in georgia he got one this morning in his intel brief and got some thoroughout the day as he was at the events
3130628 this afternoon at about 1 50 p m edt he spoke with his national security adviser stephen hadley and he got a comprehensive briefing on the situation we are continuously working to gather facts and analyzing facts on the ground
3130629 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3130630 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3130631 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3130632 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3130633 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3130634 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3130635 this wasnt something imposed it seems that this backtracking would be the result of the backlash from anti muslim hate web sites and islamophobes on the internet
3130636 i would have thought that people would have been more sensitive and sympathetic to the concern to the members of our community who want to celebrate their religious faith
3130637 its a little disingenuous to say that they tyson were responding to employee concerns the proposal came from workers themselves
3130638 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3130639 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3130640 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3130641 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3130642 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3130643 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3130644 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3130645 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3130646 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3130647 we are not staying home with our children by default
3130648 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3130649 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3130650 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3130651 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
3130652 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3130653 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
3130654 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
3130655 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
3130656 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
3130657 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
3130658 is this food something that will help or hurt my heart

3130671 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3130672 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3130673 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3130674 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3130675 go and say to this people keep listening but do not comprehend keep looking but do not understand make the mind of this people dull and stop their ears and shut their eyes so that they may not look with their eyes and listen with their ears and comprehend with their minds and turn and be healed
3130676 listen a sower went out to sow 4 and as he sowed some seeds fell on the path and the birds came and ate them up 5 other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil and they sprang up quickly since they had no depth of soil 6 but when the sun rose they were scorched and since they had no root they withered away 7 other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them 8 other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty 9 let anyone with ears listen
3130677 hear then the parable of the sower 19 when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart this is what was sown on the path 20 as for what was sown on rocky ground this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy 21 yet such a person has no root but endures only for a while and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word that person immediately falls away 22 as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word and it yields nothing 23 but as for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty
3130678 whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me 41 whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous 42 and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple truly i tell you none of these will lose their reward
3130679 a worshiper of god from the city of thyatira a dealer in purple cloth
3130680 the lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by paul
3130681 apparently it was the act of hospitality symbolized in the breaking of bread that tipped them off to the presence of jesus his closest followers had for some reason come to identify jesus with hospitality and so hospitality is important to who we are and what we do as christians
3130682 what is the reward of a prophet or a righteous person
3130683 the names of the prophets and where they are from and where they died and how and where they lie
3130684 manasseh the son of hezekiah slew isaiah with a wooden saw he was buried before the outfall of the waters which hezekiah concealed by the side of siloah
3130685 you see the extent to which we are hospitable to others is commensurate with the extent to which we have welcomed the transforming presence of god into our own lives

3130689 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
3130690 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
3130691 but speaking the truth in love we must grow up in every way into him who is the head into christ
3130692 call a spade a spade sock it to them but lovingly

3130694 have i become your enemy by telling you the truth
3130695 the worl d will assume that all ways of living which an ordained person is allowed to adopt are in christian eyes equally valid

3130701 the vision of a global church of interdependent communities is not the vision of an ecclesiastical world empire or even a colonial relic the globa l horizon of the church matters because churches without this are always in danger of slowly surrendering to the culture around them and losing sight of their calling to challenge that culture

3130716 the saccharide composition glucose to fructose ratio of hfcs is approximately the same as that of honey invert sugar and the disaccharide sucrose or table sugar
3130717 no differences in the metabolic effects in lean women of hfcs compared to sucrose
3130718 the currently available evidence is insufficient to implicate hfcs per se as a causal factor in the overweight and obesity problem in the united states

3130728 this is a deserted place and the hour is now late send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves
3130729 they need not go away you give them something to eat
3130730 we have nothing here but five loaves and two fish

3130732 a disciple is not above the teacher nor a slave above the master
3130733 so have no fear of them for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered and nothing secret that will not become known
3130734 everyone therefore who acknowledges me before others i also will acknowledge before my father in heaven
3130735 do not think that i have come to bring peace to the earth i have not come to bring peace but a sword
3130736 jesus is not advocating violence here for he has already made clear in the sermon on the mount that the way of god demands a refusal to repay violence with violence
3130737 when jesus speaks of the division that he will cause amongst families he is speaking about what is bound to happen when people respond in faith to his message
3130738 jesus response may seem a little insensitive to us he simply says
3130739 jesus is not saying that your family is not important but matthews story indicates that the call of god must be the first priority in our lives even above our own families
3130740 because we know what will happen to jesus by the end of matthews gospel we are able to recognize the implications of what this means for those who follow jesus
3130741 if they will do this to jesus what do you think they will do to you who follow his way
3130742 god is king now let us live like god is king
3130743 at the close of our text for this morning matthew seems to draw these points together love of god and love of neighbor holiness and justice using the metaphor of cross bearing
3130744 the gospel of matthew as a whole is simply a commentary on this crucially important passage
3130745 are you the one who is to come or shall we look for another
3130746 go and tell john what you hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised and the poor have good news brought to them
3130747 all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him
3130748 i thank you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants
3130749 come to me all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens and i will give you rest 29 take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls 30 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
3130750 images a refusal to celebrate in a time of celebration and a refusal to mourn in a time of mourning
3130751 deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the bible to fit his own confused theology
3130752 you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants
3130753 of course i would affirm that our intellect is a gift from god that should be used to glorify god but matthew reminds us that overconfidence can leave us blind to true wisdom
3130754 long term coffee drinking did not substantially increase the risk of developing hypertension
3130755 listen to this dream that i dreamed 7 there we were binding sheaves in the field suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright then your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf
3130756 are you indeed to reign over us are you indeed to have dominion over us
3130757 look i have had another dream the sun the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me
3130758 what kind of dream is this that you have had shall we indeed come i and your mother and your brothers and bow to the ground before you
3130759 here comes this dreamer 20 come now let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits then we shall say that a wild animal has devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams
3130760 shed no blood throw him into this pit here in the wilderness but lay no hand on him
3130761 what profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood 27 come let us sell him to the ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him for he is our brother our own flesh
3130762 the boy is gone and i where can i turn
3130763 this we have found see now whether it is your sons robe or not
3130764 it is my sons robe a wild animal has devoured him joseph is without doubt torn to pieces
3130765 no i shall go down to sheol to my son mourning
3130766 brought a bad report of his brothers to their father
3130767 favoritism has a long pedigree in jacobs family isaac loved esau more than jacob rebekah loved jacob more than esau and most pertinently jacob loved rachel more than leah
3130768 and so within a few years time joseph a hebrew slave rises to power in egypt he becomes the number two in command of one of the largest and most powerful empires in the history of the world
3130769 even though you intended to do harm to me god intended it for good
3130770 for your sake we are being killed all day long we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered
3130771 we know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit groan inwardly while we wait for adoption the redemption of our bodies for in this hope we were saved
3130772 this is good news for us because we live our lives in that sometimes confusing tension between d day and v day between the resurrection of christ and the completion of gods promise to make all things new and to set all of creation in rhythm with the purpose of god
3130773 now i must tell you that this is one of the most misused verses in all of scripture
3130774 therefore just as one mans trespass led to condemnation for all so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all
3130775 the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few 38 therefore ask the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
3130776 go nowhere among the gentiles and enter no town of the samaritans
3130777 you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the end of the earth
3130778 we should send our missionaries at first not to the feeble and inert people of burma and thailand nor to the illiterate and impotent red men of our forest nor to the debased and stupid idolaters of africa and polynesia
3130779 the rabbis converse very freely upon the subject of christianity and i may say without the semblance of boasting that with all their talmudic lore and rabbinical sophistry it is quite easy to gain the most complete victory over them by the appropriate use of the sword of the spirit
3130780 but for now he says to his apostles stick with what you know
3130781 the point is that as they set out to proclaim and demonstrate the reign of god there are some who will be prepared to hear their message and some who will not
3130782 praticamente n o h limites o google precisa consertar isso
3130783 and so jacob is forced away from his mother and his dying father
3130784 i am the lord the god of abraham your father and the god of isaac the land on which you lie i will give to you and to your offspring 14 and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring 15 know that i am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land for i will not leave you until i have done what i have promised you
3130785 surely the lord is in this place and i did not know it
3130786 how awesome is this place this is none other than the house of god and this is the gate of heaven
3130787 if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear 21 so that i come again to my fathers house in peace then the lord shall be my god 22 and this stone which i have set up for a pillar shall be gods house and of all that you give me i will surely give one tenth to you
3130788 jacobs expectations of encountering yahweh somewhere between beersheba and haran were about as great as sauls expectations of meeting the christ somewhere between jerusalem and damascus
3130789 he has become convinced that god has abandoned him that what happens to him is of no concern to god and that god has even forgotten the covenant made with abraham of which jacob is the heir
3130790 what is it about the realization that god is present and cares about the course of his life that causes jacob to have such a radical change of heart

3130798 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3130799 now when jesus had finished saying these things the crowds were astounded at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as their scribes
3130800 why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners

3130807 why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
3130808 is borrowed from hosea 6 6 and in this context it registers a sharp critique of those who look down upon tax collectors and sinners because of their ritual impurity

3130819 the media tells everyone that feminism is dead thanks to fools like rush limbaugh and ann coulter feminists are portrayed as man hating irrelevant neo liberals with no social conscience media wants to put feminists in a little box and call on us once in a while for sound bites on a devastating rape or domestic violence
3130820 because of this imagery im less likely to admit that im a feminist i consider myself more of a humanist
3130821 the media wants us to conform a bit to societal beauty standards while sneaking our message through ultimately what can be said if a average jane feminist needs to get a makeover or be attractive to be heard why would i associate myself with a word that would generate hate towards me

3130856 first of all we should become a country of sporting culture
3130857 so far sports administrators are thinking that only when we organize all these mega events like commonwealth games asian games olympic games then only you can galvanize the country i am not so sure about that unless you spend the same amount of money in promoting sportsmen i think that will create a better impact
3130858 the police said we will first inquire whether adeel has committed suicide because the culprits told the police about the fact that their daughter wanted to embrace christianity because of adeel

3130869 everything about her radiates competence and a deft bright careerism
3130870 she wants to succeed makes no bones about campaigning for her own television show and yet evinces a regular person charm and self doubt that ensures youll never mistake her ambition for bloodthirst or bullying
3130871 at some point i dont know when she should have a show
3130872 shes on the short list its a very short list shes at the top

3130879 our construction alone will create some 330 000 new places in junior high schools including in some of indonesias poorest and remote areas
3130880 in all challenges indonesia can count on australia to work with it as a friend and partner
3130881 were there to listen to understand what happened last night and to avoid these kinds of situations
3130882 this course is diabolical its like trying to play scrabble without the vowels
3130883 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
3130884 this one is more frustrating because im the two time defending champion
3130885 the only noise i heard was somebody getting hit by a golf ball and they were grunts no birdie cheers
3130886 so i was warming it up and then id go practice then re warming it up and then going to practice again and i was eating and watching the olympics and talking and taking a nap i just kind of covered all the bases
3130887 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
3130888 i was nervous i hardly dared to talk to her before the tournament i wanted annika to win it shes my favorite player
3130889 thats a lot of golf to have never been ahead
3130890 i think thats just a testament of how much patience thats required
3130891 last year was really tough not winning im very proud of myself with how i played i wanted this so much i would have been crushed if i wouldnt have won it if i hadnt had last years experience i may have given up a little bit or tried to force something
3130892 when the title of my book was announced my mind went completely blank i never heard my name called i just kept saying what what did she say until my editor gave me a little push and said get up you won it was both thrilling and humbling
3130893 she would take the tip in her mouth and just lick the head
3130894 i thought they my breasts were much too large for any good use
3130895 i thought an acl anterior cruciate ligament when i did it
3130896 but a pcl you think 10 weeks and i thought the season but its amazing how quickly the strength comes back and how much your fitness can come back that quick
3130897 now it feels good and im ready to play again
3130898 in all honesty hes not really ready for first grade and i wanted to see how he did handle it
3130899 he didnt play like a natural halfback and he was probably a little bit overawed when he got out there but individually he came out with some brilliant things
3130900 i would have liked to see him catch that ball and get a try it would have been a bit of a thrill
3130901 its nice we havent done it in the last couple of years so thats an achievement in itself
3130902 but we probably played three teams who were down on their luck
3130903 we had access to too much money too much equipment and little by little we went insane
3130904 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
3130905 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on
3130906 i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
3130907 i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing
3130908 it hasnt sunk in yet im just over the moon
3130909 spencer made that putt a bomb it was a huge putt for him
3130910 for me to make it on top of him it takes all the wind from his sails to make that at that time you cant ask for anything more
3130911 i love ben curtis a lot and i love the fact hes made the team
3130912 i just wanted to shoot something good and see what happened
3130913 i thought maybe i could catch boo but he was playing right in front of me so i knew by the last few holes that wasnt going to happen
3130914 its going to come down to how i play the next three events
3130915 hopefully i can play well and get on his radar im disappointed because i had a chance to take care of my own business this week and now it is out of my control ive got to play well
3130916 candace johnson was a member of a protected class that the firearms owners identification card statute was intended to protect since she had been in a mental institution within five years prior to her suicide and her purchase of firearms ammunition from wal mart it meant she could not possess a firearms owners identification card
3130917 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3130918 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that playing as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3130919 its nice to be known for something good like that
3130920 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3130921 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3130922 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality hes that type of guy thats going to put his head down and barrel on
3130923 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning
3130924 if ever there was a golf course you could discount a poor round this would be the one
3130925 would i have liked both of them to have played better of course theres three weeks to go i like both of them a lot so i dont think you can say that rocco choked yesterday and i really dont think j b has any choke in him
3130926 i could see that he was hanging in there nicely and he had a good start and he hung on tough
3130927 i wasnt only focused about padraig i thought that ben had a realistic shot at it too and he was 2 3 4 under there the whole day unfortunately he made a couple bogeys coming in like i did but it was a three man race and padraig came up on top
3130928 neural and behavioral effects in fetuses infants and children at current human exposures

3130930 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3130931 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3130932 obviously i was trying to win but thats it its not disappointing
3130933 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
3130934 hes such a talented player that its just a matter of time
3130935 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
3130936 i could have taken the line of the shot but that would have put me in the stands or i could have gone back to the tee i had to go in there and try to hit something i tried to hit a 3 wood and i didnt get it out
3130937 it was my first time in the last group in a major and i dont think it will be my last time
3130938 im disappointed for j b holmes but hes still on my radar
3130939 i would have liked to obviously play better but i had a good week
3130940 i had my ups and downs had a little go of it early in the round and tried to make a move
3130941 i dont think anybody expects us to do that well
3130942 however im optimistic that our team is going to play well
3130943 it was tough weather and it hurt to miss those par putts but im just proud of myself the way i hung tight
3130944 the wind was really starting to blow so i tried to hit a low 4 iron that was the strongest iron i had in the bag
3130945 it started off perfect and i said be as good as you look then when it landed i called out go in the hole
3130946 the guys just cracked up when it went in especially since i called it

3130948 1 the us aided also by france britain and canada is finalizing preparations for a partial naval blockade to deny iran imports of benzene and other refined oil products this action would indicate that the bush administration had thrown in the towel on stiff united nations sanctions and decided to take matters in its own hands 2 iran which imports 40 percent of its refined fuel products from gulf neighbors will retaliate for the embargo by shutting the strait of hormuz oil route chokepoint in which case the us naval and air force stand ready to reopen the strait and fight back any iranian attempt to break through the blockade 3 washington is deploying forces as back up for a possible israeli military attack on irans nuclear installations 4 a potential rush of events in which a us led blockade israeli attack and iranian reprisals pile up in a very short time and precipitate a major military crisis 5 while a massive deployment of this nature calls for long planning its occurrence at this time cannot be divorced from the flare up of the caucasian war between russia and georgia while russia has strengthened its stake in caspian oil resources by its overwhelming military intervention against georgia the americans are investing might in defending the primary persian gulf oil sources of the west and the far east

3130957 it was georgian president mikheil saakashvili who started it hoping to redraw the whole situation with one sweeping action but if it goes on for much longer it is likely that there will be no winners and russia will suffer very badly too
3130958 no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3130959 russia is moving toward an analagous role vis vis south ossetia to that which the us plays when it for example guarantees the security of taiwan against attack by mainland china
3130960 but this situation is beginning to look too much like a direct clash between russia and the us
3130961 this is an historical problem my great grandmother told me that in the 1920s she saw georgians massacring the south ossetians
3130962 she said they came in fast on horses and attacked with sabres
3130963 after all this i dont believe ossetians and georgians can live together i just want a machine gun and to stand beside my brothers

3130966 reconciliation will be a long painful process before we can find common ground especially as one regional superpower wants us to remain enemies reaching understanding wont be done by politics but by a human process
3130967 i cant say whether this is a case of genocide but it certainly is a humanitarian catastrophe
3130968 the methods saakashvili used to establish constitutional order have to be condemned by the international community

3131051 it is obvious that if any high ranking government executive may privatize his conduct of public business by establishing a private account or dealing with private providers of communications technologies it would allow government officials to unilaterally create a vast and unacceptable loophole in the requirements
3131052 governor must assume either the risk of disclosure or the burden of identifying and redacting calls that are unrelated to public business

3131153 fazer papel de palha o para compra de ingresso para o que chamam de show do jo o gilberto at compreens vel em se tratando de brasil o pior depois deste desgaste assistir um show repetitivo deste cantor voc s imaginam o caetano veloso cantar sem len o sem documento em todo show que ele d seria o maior desrespeito com seus f s pois exatamente o que o jo o gilberto faz h muitos e muitos anos sempre a mesma coisa e tem gente que ainda paga um mico para ir assistir voc s merecem
3131154 eu conseguir ser atendido depois de mais de uma hora e vinte minutos ouvindo que os operadores estavam ocupados e que eu deveria aguardar mais um pouco fui atendido e comprei um ingresso de 30 reais para quinta feira e um ingresso de 30 reais para a sexta feira paguei 15 reais por cada j que sou estudante liguei para a ticketmaster por volta das 9h da manh e fui atendido 10h20 a operadora me informou que a procura estava muito grande e que o motivo da demora em me atender era que eles tinham mais de 80 pessoas na fila de espera das liga es paguei com o cart o do patrocinador e me foi oferecido o parcelamento em 3 vezes sem juros no ato o cart o foi aprovado e o c digo de retirada do ingresso no local foi entregue j tenho a numera o das cadeiras para ambos os dias na fileira m primeira fileira que possui pre o popular irei a ambos os shows e por sinal se voc s precisarem de opini es de como foi estou a disposi o
3131155 me programei h meses para ir ao show financeiramente profissionalmente espiritualmente a id ia era aproveitar e presentear meu pai pelo dia dos pais e minha m e pelo seu anivers rio imposs vel entrei no trabalho s 7 da manh e o primeiro site que acessei foi o da ticketmaster assim como eu os colegas estavam euf ricos entre um f5 e outro o cora o acelera os ingressos est o dispon veis por um segundo achei que conseguiria imaginei meu pai com o ingresso na m o o jo o no palco era a realiza o de um sonho que h anos atr s data da ltima apresenta o em s o paulo eu era novo demais para entender infelizmente a ilus o durou pouco e talvez tenha que esperar mais alguns anos para ver o g nio planejo ir ao rio arriscar a sorte ver se n o consigo pegar o show l sei que ser dif cil sei que posso n o conseguir ingresso mas me contentarei se ao menos for respeitado como consumidor o que aconteceu com a ticketmaster um absurdo e um desrespeito que al m de tirar a credibilidade da empresa afasta ainda mais o cidad o comum do acesso cultura de primeira qualidade
3131156 realmente foi uma vergonha a compra para os ingressos do show do jo o gilberto para mim que sou f de carteirinha do m sico s ficou a decep o depois de in meras tentativas por telefone e internet e sem a perspectiva sequer de correr bilheteria na hora do almo o fiquei sem ingresso para o show quem conseguiu pelo que li de dezenas de relatos foi somente quem ficou pendurado no telefone e internet durante horas o que eu n o podia fazer pois estava trabalhando isso porque os ingressos para o show custavam r 360 o desrespeito com o p blico foi total e sei que a decep o n o foi s minha mas de muitos outros f s show do caetano e do roberto se as vendas forem feitas dessa maneira tamb m nem pensar n o sou palha a e tenho certeza que os outros f s tamb m n o
3131157 eu sinceramente duvido que esta pane tenha sido acidental mesmo que tenha sido mostra o qu o fr gil e incompetente a empresa ticketmaster afinal n o de hoje que ela tem gerado algumas reclama es ontem fiquei duas horas assim como muita gente na frente do computador e com o telefone na m o sem sucesso algum quando consegui l estavam todos os ingressos esgotados temo que as chances de ver jo o gilberto tocando novamente em terras tupiniquins s o baix ssimas em s o paulo ent o nem se fala realmente uma pena pois haver muitos figur es nesse show com certeza enquanto quem se matou pra tentar comprar os ingressos vai ter que se contentar com discos e grava es lament vel
3131158 n o entendo o porqu desse au todo por causa de um artista prepotente e mal humorado
3131159 n o comprei n o quis comprar fiquei sabendo da pane e tentando comprar por puro diletantismo e nunca conseguia tentei milh es de vezes liguei nada aconteceia eu ria mais chegou um momento em que eu me peguei pensando na doralice doralice eu bem que lhe disse que esse show tolice bobagem a bossa nova como um todo uma ilus o a cultura brasileira junto o legal de ter o jo o gilberto no brasil cobrando r 2 milh es pra fazer um show a mesma coisa que tem de l dica na afirma o do tom jobin de que enquanto as pessoas n o morarem todas em ipanema haver injusti a social no brasil tudo brincadeira tudo piada e essa hist ria de que pessoas intru das do pa s do futuro se interessam por essas coisas outra piada da m dia estilo pcc
3131160 confesso que recebo com espanto todo esse barulho a respeito o processo me pareceu muito simples ligar e comprar ou acessar o site e solicitar os ingressos liguei assim que disponibilizaram as vendas comprei e inclusive fui muito bem atendida tanto no momento da compra quanto no momento que precisei tirar algumas d vidas sobre a entrega dos ingressos com o servi o de atendimento ao cliente da empresa minutos antes da venda solicitei informa es por e mail e tamb m fui prontamente atendida claro que quando trata se de eventos extremamente concorridos imagino que possam ocorrer filas de espera para atendimento n o estou falando apenas de jo o gilberto eventos como cirque du soleil rod stewart roger waters tamb m podem ser citados
3131161 estava aguardando ansiosamente pelo in cio das vendas dos ingressos
3131162 sou de manaus e h mais de dez anos aguardo a oportunidade no in cio do ano quando eu estava prestes a comprar um ingresso para o carnegie hall cujo site disponibilizara com meses de anteced ncia at a escolha de assentos no jvc jazz festival foi noticiado que haveria shows no brasil minha passagem para s o paulo j estava comprada no momento me preparo para acampar em frente ao teatro municipal do rio de janeiro tamb m j fui avisado sobre a presen a de pessoas idosas pagas por cambistas na fila dos shows de salvador e ainda querem sediar olimp adas e copa do mundo hil rio eu afirmo que nunca na hist ria desse pa s o consumidor foi t o desrespeitado no peito dos desrespeitados tamb m bate um cora o
3131163 n o vou repetir o que os demais leitores j descreveram passei tamb m o mesmo sufoco e n o consegui comprar amo jo o gilberto desde 1958 e nunca consegui ver uma apresenta o ao vivo lament vel mas se houvesse boa vontade e bom senso h uma solu o colocar tel es do lado de fora para quem n o conseguiu o disputado ingresso em buenos aires j vi isso em v rios shows que atra ram muitos espectadores o tel o com um bom sistema de som um consolo para quem ficou fora que absurdo acompanhar pela internet a disputa pela revenda desses ingressos uma afronta aos que admiram jo o gilberto
3131164 tamb m fiquei horas tentando via site e via fone nada funcionava e n o consegui comprar inaceit vel a postura da ticketmaster para o show do jo o em nova iorque em junho passado comprei os ingressos diretamente no carnegie hall no primeiro dia de venda via fone fui super bem atendido consegui ingressos para fileira a e pelo pre o de us 100 cada em menos de 5 minutos minha compra foi efetuada debitada no cart o online pude escolher os assentos e segundos depois recebi um e mail de confirma o no dia do show meus ingressos estavam l dispon veis e corretos n o me parece ser algo t o dif cil assim
3131165 achei o maior absurdo essa venda de ingressos preferia dormido na bilheteria do que ficar das 9h30 at meio dia tentando ligar e acessar a internet n o era muito bvio que o site iria dar pau e a linha telef nica s daria ocupado para mim isso tudo m fia pois quem tentou comprar sabe que tava imposs vel pode at ser sorte mas que estava imposs vel estava vergonhoso isso
3131166 tamb m fiquei horas tentando via site e via fone nada funcionava e n o consegui comprar inaceit vel a postura da ticketmaster para o show do jo o em nova york em junho passado comprei os ingressos diretamente no carnegie hall no primeiro dia de venda 09 de abril pelo telefone fui super bem atendido consegui ingressos para fileira a e pelo pre o de us 100 cada em menos de 5 minutos minha compra foi efetuada debitada no cart o on line pude escolher os assentos e segundos depois recebi um e mail de confirma o no dia do show meus ingressos estavam l dispon veis e corretos n o me parece ser algo t o dif cil assim fico com a lembran a de um dos melhores shows que j vi do jo o a cr tica do sergio davila na ilustrada da folha perfeita que seja revista a parceria com a ticketmaster e a venda auditorada pelo procon para verifica o de quantos ingressos foram disponibilizados para venda tem lei rouanet neste patroc nio
3131167 complementando o relato anteriormente enviado hoje 7 recebo uma comunica o do sac da ticketmaster informando que o meu pedido n o foi sequer analisado por
3131168 h mais de um m s entramos em contato com a ticketmaster para confirmarmos o hor rio e como seriam as vendas dos ingressos que nos foi confirmado para o dia 5 de agosto a partir das 10h hor rio de s o paulo nesse dia come amos tentar acessar o site a partir das 08h30 hor rio campo grande por 3 computadores e 2 linhas telef nicas sem sucesso at o hor rio das 10h30 aproximadamente sem xito o servidor n o estava dispon vel e as linhas telef nicas ocupadas na internet por volta desse hor rio foi poss vel acessar o site no entanto n o se conseguia fechar a solicita o eram preenchido todos os dados solicitados e na hora de efetuar a compra vinha o comando para reiniciar durou uns 15 minutos ap s esse tempo veio a mensagem ingressos esgotados isso absurdo esse esquema j estava montado aqui em campo grande se comenta que tem gente vendendo ingressos a r 1 000 para completar a minha indigna o aparece a not cia de que na verdade 300 ingressos por dia j estavam direcionados essa informa o n o estava no site lamento um artista tico como jo o gilberto ter rela o comercial com uma quadrilha de cambistas se algu m quiser verificar o que ocorreu s entrevistar as pessoas na porta do teatro para ver quanto pagaram pelo ingresso e como compraram os mesmos com certeza muita gente vai ficar constrangida acho que dever amos processar essa empresa de cambistas chamada ticketmaster lamento mas estou muito indignado com isso
3131169 no dia 5 antes das 9h da manh me loguei no site da ticketmaster ao mesmo tempo em que meu marido come ou a tentativa por telefone o site estava bastante lento mas por volta de 9h10 conseguimos efetivar a compra via internet como norma do site eu deveria receber a confirma o de compra em at 72h j se passaram mais de 72h liguei para o atendimento da ticketmaster e segundo a atendente eu devo aguardar at o final desta sexta feira pois eles venderam mais ingressos do que o n mero de asssentos e agora est o remanejando no sistema o que conseguirem as mesmas pessoas que estavam nesta situa o e que compraram com cart o ita receberam a confirma o mesmo que tenham comprado depois ao que tudo indica n o deveria haver prioridade para clientes ita na medida em que muitos compraram depois de quem efetuou a compra pelo site um desrespeito absurdo todo o procedimento para quem como eu mora em estados mais distantes resta o des nimo para fazer qualquer outra tentativa de compra para os shows do rio e salvador
3131170 comecei a tentar comprar o ingresso para o show do jo o gilberto na manh da ter a feira por volta das 9h50
3131171 para mim era bvio que um show do jo o gilberto num espa o t o pequeno geraria problemas na compra dos ingressos por isso resolvi entrar na internet as 8h da manh e n o as 10h como havia sido divulgado s n o consegui comprar pela net pq minha conex o absurdamente lenta e neste caso cada segundo faria a diferen a enquanto acessava a internet s 9h a venda j estava liberada tentava com o telefone de casa e o celular um ctto com a tm milh es de tentativas depois eles atenderam mais ou menos umas 10h15 fiquei uma meia hora aguardando mas valeu a pena cada segundo comprei 4 ingressos 30 00 com dois cpfs s n o entendo a indigna o de tanta gente com rela o ticket master s fazer uma conta quantos f s s em sp n o adorariam ir a esse show milharesssss s o milharesssss de pessoas tentando acesso ao mesmo tempo bvio que o site travaria e acham que 2 horas muito pouco tempo para esgotarem os ingressos pelo amor de deus se cada pessoa que conseguiu o contato comprou mais de um ingresso no caso eu comprei 4 seria preciso pouco mais de 400 pessoas para esgotar tudo sem falar na cota das celebridades
3131172 o meu caso com a compra do ingresso foi timo n o consegui l gico mas os meus hor rios s o os mais diferentes de todos os relatos que eu j li eu fui atendido s 10h58 e fui informado que j n o havia mais ingressos para nenhum dos dois dias e em nenhum setor o que acaba com a id ia de que foi uma hora e meia de venda n o querendo ouvir a minha pr xima pergunta a mo a da ticketmaster desligou na minha cara tudo bem depois conversando com um amigo meu que trabalha na ticketmaster fui informado que o n mero de ingressos divulgado n o tem nada a ver com o 1 600 bem menos que isso acontece que o ita tem uma lista de convidados um tanto longa e com isso o n mero de ingressos dispon veis caiu dr sticamente custava avisar
3131173 acabo de ter a not cia de que o pedido dos dois ingressos que eu havia requisitado foi cancelado por falta de lugar
3131174 en estos momentos en el pa s existe una sujestividad negativa con relaci n al servicio energ tico

3131176 my family is my life its an easy distinction for me to make
3131177 technically reading a book and returning it is theft of knowledge
3131178 i dont advocate making a habit of buying new books reading them and returning them but once in a while i do think mass returns are a useful form of consumer protest
3131179 they took back my book with no problem got into a discussion with the cashier about how i was the 15th person to bring my book back today
3131180 the council has worked hard with its partners to produce realistic and commercially viable proposals that will see a lasting regeneration of skelmersdale town centre with the environmental economic and social benefits that it will bring not only to the town but to the district as a whole
3131181 we see the proposals at kirkby as being completely out of scale and likely to prejudice the success not only of the skelmersdale regeneration scheme but also the retail vitality of other sub regional centres
3131182 if you need solutions manuals and test banks for any accounting text auditing text taxation text finance text business text etc
3131183 barack obama is fortunate that the conflict in south ossetia has occurred during the olympics depriving it of some of it of the coverage that it otherwise might receive he is also fortunate that americans dont have much attention span for foreign affairs outside of matters involving iraq and al qaeda
3131184 how to make yourself look like youre doing something so you can keep your job
3131185 im your superior and heres how i assert authority over you in a very passive aggressive way
3131186 it might be time for him to revise those numbers upward
3131187 ich stelle fest dass kurt waldheim nie bei der sa war sondern nur sein pferd
3131188 ive got to get a few things cleaned up but overall i felt good about it
3131189 was denken sie denn warum sie weint wonach sieht es denn aus
3131190 ich habe die das selbe n mlich schon vor einer stunde gefragt lange bevor sie zugestiegen sind und statt mir ordentlich zu antworten hat sie wieder mit dem geflenne angefangen bei der k nnen sie ein vern nftiges gespr ch vergessen
3131191 das h tt ich ihnen gleich sagen k nnen aber die leute wissen ja immer alles besser
3131192 o ato lembrou os 181 anos da faculdade de direito de pernambuco a primeira escola jur dica do pa s
3131193 this election is not about democrats or republicans its about electing the best man to lead us forward the next four years as the president of the united states and the best man for that position is senator john mccain
3131194 and i know from personal experience that the linden voters are intelligent and sophisticated because in 2006 i ran for the mayor of this great city as an independent against a 30 year democratic incumbent and the voters chose the man not the party
3131195 youre going to see a lot more leaders like the members of the council and mayor who are coming out and saying in the end the presidency of the united states is beyond republicans democrats or independents
3131196 its about who is going to be the best leader for our country
3131197 polls are notoriously at this point in the campaign not necessarily the most reliable president dukakis for instance would look back at the campaign at this point in 1988 and say polls arent necessarily indicative
3131198 from a fundraising perspective it makes a lot of sense that both sen clinton and sen obama raised a lot more money in new jersey their campaign was much more heated and lasted much longer
3131199 its communicating with god we wouldnt be able to foster an intimate relationship if we didnt talk to our best friend on a regular basis its our way of speaking to god and the bible is when god speaks to us we need to pray so we can see our prayers answered to strengthen our faith
3131200 praying in the name of my lord and savior jesus christ
3131201 our father who art in heaven hallowed by thy name
3131202 what a novel idea prayer as a means of becoming more preoccupied with the beauty of jesus name than paralyzed by the burden of our needs
3131203 faremos isso inclusive atrav s da continua o das obras de infra estrutura realizadas pela gest o de luciana santos
3131204 quando a gente melhora a infra estrutura aparece mais pessoas querendo investir vou entrar na hist ria como o prefeito que mais cal ou rua em olinda
3131205 j inclui no or amento da uni o para 2009 recursos para reformar toda a orla daquela parte do antigo quartel at a praia de rio doce pr ximo ao janga

3131209 when all is said and done over half of the tax debt inventory that the resolves will come from writing off the tax or being prevented from collecting it under the 10 year statute of limitations
3131210 written off due to statutory limits on how long could pursue the debt
3131211 a firms lobbying expenses are significantly positively correlated with its accounting based financial performance that lobbying expenses are also significantly and positively related to firms market prices and returns indicating that lobbying expenses are value relevant that portfolios of firms with the high lobbying intensities outperform their benchmarks of non lobbying firms
3131212 that lobbying firms tend to be large firms and size may be a natural limiting factor
3131213 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3131214 its been a situation that unfortunately we havent brought guys in
3131215 i control what i can control come out every day and get our guys as good as we can im pleased with the top of our roster but we need to add to the bottom of our roster we need more competition
3131216 hes a great guy with talent a good nose for the ball he brings a lot to the game im excited to have him here
3131217 he can cover tight ends play defense play the run so im excited to have him
3131218 he never had the chance to pick up a weapon

3131222 i believe that i am best suited to make a positive difference in that district
3131223 its something im just thinking about all options are open to me well just have to see
3131224 while our industry continues to be challenged we remain highly committed to our mortgage insurance business
3131225 our focus has been on trying to attend to barbara and her needs and trying to deal with the shock of losing todd and trying to begin the grieving process as well
3131226 clearly elisabeth was a victim in this as well even though she was physically unscathed he said
3131227 having to deal with this event has been hard for her
3131228 she has shown incredible strength in the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it and there have been a lot of tears and hugs the fact that shes able to get in amongst it and already be able to address what happened is a testament to her strength of character
3131229 i believe random acts of violence are random acts of violence he said
3131230 it seems unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3131231 he was a great father a loving husband its hard to imagine a nicer person that this tragic and senseless thing could happen to
3131232 we are all definitely emotionally drained and have been playing with a lot of emotion for the last 48 hours said lindsey berg a former gopher
3131233 we will stay strong for the family and the whole u s delegation
3131234 for decades hes been washingtons biggest celebrity john mccain and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3131235 all crimes have to be fixed and be analysed later
3131236 we received very reliable information that the russians decided to move towards gori thats why we decided to pull out all our troops and to relocate them to defend tbilisi
3131237 we are right now driving through the town and i see no trace of troops or military vehicles it is absolutely deserted
3131238 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3131239 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3131240 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict
3131241 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia senaki is one of the places where such actions were underway
3131242 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3131243 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3131244 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3131245 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3131246 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3131247 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3131248 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3131249 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3131250 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3131251 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3131252 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3131253 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3131254 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3131255 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3131256 wherein on the basis of serbias moral responsibility for the events of june 28 the murder of the archduke franz ferdinand certain demands would be addressed to her for the suppression in future of great serb propaganda
3131257 it is altogether difficult to foresee the effect which any one political action may produce abroad
3131258 two principles were in sharp conflict the maintenance of austria as a conglomerate of various nationalities and the rise of independent national states claiming their ethnic territories from austria hungary for this reason and not with a view to expiating the murder of franz ferdinand austria hungary had to go to war against serbia
3131259 we consider that that the latest developments such as the crossing of the georgian borders by russian troops changed the dimension of he conflict we therefore call upon russia to stop immediately all military activity on georgian territory
3131260 we are providing through this funding of one million euros in areas such as basic emergency shelter tents for example or food or water and sanitation all these issues need to be dealt with when you have populations on the move
3131261 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3131262 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
3131263 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
3131264 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
3131265 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
3131266 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially
3131267 those with whom he is negotiating georgias accession to nato
3131268 some powerful weapons through the upgrade of su 25 planes and artillery systems in israel
3131269 claiming that us as well as nato and israeli military assistance to georgia is destabilizing the region
3131270 georgia has received 206 tanks of which 175 units were supplied by nato states 186 armored vehicles 126 from nato 79 guns 67 from nato 25 helicopters 12 from nato 70 mortars ten surface to air missile systems eight israeli made unmanned aircraft and other weapons in addition nato countries have supplied four combat aircraft to georgia the russian defense ministry said there were plans to deliver to georgia 145 armored vehicles 262 guns and mortars 14 combat aircraft including four mirazh 2000 destroyers 25 combat helicopters 15 american black hawk aircraft six surface to air missile systems and other arms
3131271 said there were no plans to redeploy the estimated 130 us troops and civilian contractors who he said were stationed in the area around tblisi
3131272 comply with nato regulations in terms of military requirements as well as social conditions
3131273 the btc pipeline considerably changes the status of the regions countries and cements a new pro west alliance
3131274 turkey and israel are negotiating the construction of a multi million dollar energy and water project that will transport water electricity natural gas and oil by pipelines to israel with the oil to be sent onward from israel to the far east
3131275 baku oil can be transported to ashkelon via this new pipeline and to india and the far east
3131276 ceyhan and the mediterranean port of ashkelon are situated only 400 km apart
3131277 georgian casualty figures ranged from 82 dead including 37 civilians to a figure of around 130 dead a russian air strike on gori a georgian town near south ossetia left 60 people dead many of them civilians georgia says
3131278 its hard to put that kind of race behind you
3131279 but it sets me up for something good the 200 free final thats my first priority
3131280 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3131281 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals as long as you have a lane it doesnt matter where you are
3131282 i really thought theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what that is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a supercharge and took it from there
3131283 i was watching michael phelps after the anchor leg touched
3131284 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3131285 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3131286 jason is the most phenomenal closer ive ever seen in my life
3131287 hes been able to get his hand on the wall from behind from ahead it doesnt matter
3131288 he was just a part of it and we were a part of it whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3131289 its been a situation that unfortunately we havent brought guys in
3131290 i control what i can control come out every day and get our guys as good as we can im pleased with the top of our roster but we need to add to the bottom of our roster we need more competition
3131291 hes a great guy with talent a good nose for the ball he brings a lot to the game im excited to have him here
3131292 he can cover tight ends play defense play the run so im excited to have him

3131299 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3131300 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3131301 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment

3131311 we believe our proposal is clearly superior for republics stockholders and is designed so we can work cooperatively with republic
3131312 we asked for savings ideas from 20 markets they came back to us with numbers
3131313 waste managements bid is in line with the 36 38 range where we think the company could execute an all cash bid for republic without issuing additional equity and maintain its investment grade debt rating
3131314 we dont expect that ever to have to be paid
3131315 republic will look at this as another hostile takeover bid and attempt to convince shareholders and its board that the allied deal provides the best growth opportunity

3131321 she was hired to come in and produce films and thats the reason she was hired
3131322 the affair began long long long before she was hired to work for the campaign almost half a year before she was hired to work on those videos
3131323 she does not give off good energy she didnt make eye contact with me
3131324 even as some national news organizations tried half heartedly to confirm the tawdry tale they ignored it in public wary of the national enquirer of edwardss dismissal of tabloid trash of wading once again into the swamp of sexual scandal without definitive proof

3131329 regierungen und unternehmen sind nicht in der lage mit dem problem klimawandel umzugehen deswegen m ssen wir das problem selbst in die hand nehmen
3131330 mit der blockade des kraftwerks haben wir gezeigt dass wir bereit sind die klimaverbrecher zu stoppen f r uns war die aktion der auftakt um den geplanten bau eines zus tzlichen kohlekraftwerks von eon in kingsnorth zu verhindern
3131331 die repression durch die polizei hat im vergleich zu den vergangenen jahren massiv zugenommen das verh ltnis von demonstrantinnen und polizistinnen war 1 zu 1 und es gab v llig berzogene kontrollen alles was nicht niet und nagelfest war wurde beschlagnahmt insbesondere fahrradschl sser und filzstifte
3131332 neben den aktionen spielten auch politische bildung und kologisches leben eine gro e rolle 2000 leute lebten hier ber eine woche zusammen ohne auch nur eine wattsekunde strom vom netz zu nehmen all unseren notwendigen strom haben wir hier auf dem camp aus erneuerbaren energien gewonnen mit solarpanelen und windr dern
3131333 nachdem das klimacamp in australien im juli und bei uns anfang august ein voller erfolg war geben wir den staffelstab an das klimacamp in hamburg weiter
3131334 wir versuchen eine internationale klimacamp bewegung aufzubauen deshalb ist f r uns die vernetzung sehr wichtig viele von uns sind hier aufgrund der erfahrungen die wir in der globalisierungskritischen bewegung gemacht haben dort haben wir gelernt dass wir zwar lokal handeln aber immer global denken m ssen
3131335 uns ist klar dass wir nicht nur gegen die neue kohlestrategie der regierungen und energiekonzerne vorgehen m ssen sondern
3131336 es geht nicht nur um co2 emissionen sondern um eine grunds tzliche infragestellung von wachstumswahn und profitstreben
3131337 i was sitting there stretching and i was cracking up watching it
3131338 but as an athlete especially at a place like michigan they teach you how to get 100 percent out of yourself in every race and thats what i was trying to do today in spite of what happened i just tried to represent my country and my team back in michigan the best way i could
3131339 as for now im trying to act as professionally as i can
3131340 i gave it my best shot and im glad i gave 100 percent today not 80 percent not 90 i gave it 100 percent
3131341 but i wish my dad could be here and i could give him a hug right now

3131440 we are honored that dow jones amp company showed this level of confidence in kodak thermal ctp technology they conducted a very thorough review process before making this significant investment in prepress equipment
3131441 printers like dow jones are attracted to kodak trendsetter news platesetters because they offer stability and high quality digital production across multiple plant locations they can assure their customers of color consistency from each print site removing a major variable from the process

3131443 and the result and the end game of this operation of russian troops is to commit ethnic cleansing and the annihilation of the ethnic georgian population in the entire abkhazia
3131444 i want to appeal to the worlds present consciousness can one in the eyes of todays world say openly and cynically those lies and can one still hesitate and so oh you know maybe we should think who is at fault and who is doing what and who started and who responded it is so clear whats happening we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3131445 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee

3131453 well shit aaron i have to have something to show for my weekend how about you
3131454 a new definition of clutter anything that complicates your life and prevents you from living in peace as you live our your purpose
3131455 clutter does more than affect us physical and emotionally it also affects us spiritually because it keeps up from following jesus fully
3131456 even noble pursuits become clutter when they endanger our sanity and leave us with no time to connect with god
3131457 a fine line exists between need and excess that line is called enough
3131458 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3131459 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3131460 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3131461 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3131462 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3131463 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation

3131471 lexico is a lean and fast growing business with rapid top and bottom line growth and is a natural addition for ask com
3131472 more than 30 percent of all searches conducted on ask com are in the reference category in fact dictionary was the second most searched term on ask com in 2007 at the same time lexicos consumers frequently seek out a search engine immediately before and after using one of lexicos sites this acquisition expands ask coms reach and aligns perfectly with our customers needs
3131473 i cant imagine a better home for lexico sites than ask com given its leadership in search technology and product innovation
3131474 this integration will give the lexico sites a better consumer experience and even more useful for finding answers

3131495 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3131496 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3131497 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3131498 he miscalculated he did not expect that moscow would rap his knuckles he thought it would just stick to rhetoric

3131500 even six months ago a 500 or 700 kilobit per second bitrate was pushing it
3131501 now while 500 700 kbps is more of the norm were seeing companies really pushing the envelope with 1 5 2 megabits per second and hd in the ranges of up to 6 megabits per second bitrates across our network this is clearly an indication of consumer desire to experience higher quality content and of content producers efforts to meet those needs quickly
3131502 content providers are enthusiastic about pushing the quality bar though a key issue is cost of delivery and potential roi

3131514 the percentage of financing which stood at 80 per cent earlier has now come down to 70 per cent stringent norms for sanctioning loans have lead to as much as two months waiting period for certain car loans
3131515 by year end were hopeful of a double digit growth for the car industry
3131516 we do not expect the growth to be higher than 8 10 per cent in the car segment for the year high interest rates and lower buying sentiments will continue to impact demand for vehicles the situation might improve during october with the festive season setting in but the outlook for the next two months looks bleak new offerings will revive sales
3131517 lending norms are expected to become stricter in some of the riskier markets such as rajasthan haryana up and mp in the event of increasing cases of defaults on repayments
3131518 during the period of lower interest rate regime truck buyers financed new purchases in excess of what was required now with the gdp growh moderating there is unutilised capacity this could impact cv sales in the coming quarters

3131526 the gac welcomes the opportunity to respond to the draft icann procedure for handling whois conflicts with privacy law
3131527 we recognise the importance of effective conflict resolution mechanisms for the whois regime and we expect to see this as an integral part of the gnso proposals for a future icann whois regime
3131528 we will provide formal advice on the conflict procedures based on the gac whois principles at the meeting in los angeles the gac recommends that the board reviews the draft procedure in light of this substantive contribution
3131529 in the interim specific cases should be referred to the relevant national government for advice on the authority of the request for derogation from the icann gtld whois policy
3131530 the gac welcomes the opportunity to respond to the draft icann procedure for handling whois conflicts with national privacy laws due to the complexity of this issue related to the diversity of national policies and procedures among gac members the gac does not believe a uniform process is workable and accordingly the interim solution from the gacs san juan communiqu should be the basis for resolving any potential conflict specific cases should be referred to the relevant national government for advice on the authority of the request for derogation from the icann gtld whois policy
3131531 the continued high ranking of the nordic nations in this authoritative index is remarkable especially considering the highly competitive and fast moving nature of todays global society what we have found is that common best practices underpin this success and that other nations and indeed organisations can learn from and adopt them there are also challenges that the nordic region must face if it is to maintain its pre eminence in this area and these too serve as useful guides for other audiences seeking to emulate its progress as globalisation moves on all countries regions and organisations will need to continually invest in the infrastructures processes skills and usage of information technology to build share and benefit from their knowledge assets
3131532 while many countries around the world are competing to attract investment and talents the nordic countries have proved able to sustain successful knowledge based strategies through a unique combination of largely self generated it infrastructure human skills and technological innovation
3131533 other advanced countries are catching up quickly in the coming years the weight of countries like india with large cohorts of highly skilled engineers will also start to be felt to maintain their e readiness advantage the nordic countries will need to prove as imaginative and dynamic as they have been in the past this will require increasing attention to existing strengths including the quality of life in safe and environment friendly societies but also to possible new sources of creativity and initiatives for example from cities and other subnational components of civil society

3131551 the instruction curriculum and training materials were excellent and i continue to refer back to them to increase my knowledge and expertise in using omniture solutions this was time well spent and i look forward to enrolling in future trainings
3131552 i would highly recommend omniture university to anyone that truly wants to understand how their online initiatives are performing and make better business decisions on future actions
3131553 the trainers were friendly and helpful in tailoring the information to each participant the lab setting gave us plenty of opportunity to practice the new skills we learned
3131554 after two years of rapid growth its a good time to consider how to build a foundation for the transformation of online video into a sustainable business
3131555 the opa study will take a comprehensive look at consumer behavior the key elements of successful video advertising and the opportunities and barriers that lie ahead
3131556 in each tour stop well discuss the study in detail and engage in lively debate about what it means for the future of media and advertising to fully explore the issues surrounding online video well hear from leading executives in advertising brand marketing and publishing
3131557 in any scenario its important to find the history of a program to know what standards were set before at our university
3131558 it means more to the girls to know they hold records that exceed what was done previously the two records that still stand its important for that person to know that they still hold a place here and it will be a goal for us to erase that this year
3131559 well be able to attract better teams here to compete
3131560 its difficult for us to call and invite just their womens team because the mens team competes in the same meets
3131561 it gives us a starting mark for all of our men some are definitely faster than other records and it will take more time to erase
3131562 my office did not provide a lot of swimming publicity or record keeping
3131563 at times that seemed ok with ray woods who was not happy with the programs poor funding
3131564 more than anything i hope it allows us a chance to connect back to some of our alumni and get them in touch with our team now
3131565 god whispers to us in our pleasures speaks in our conscience but shouts in our pains it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world
3131566 see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on christ
3131567 why dont you ever wear your nice shirts someone may see your armpit
3131568 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3131569 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3131570 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3131571 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3131572 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3131573 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3131574 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3131575 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3131576 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3131577 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3131578 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3131579 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3131580 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3131611 regret does not even begin to describe my feelings about the relationship i feel terrible about what the school and his family have been through
3131612 at the time when i was dealing with a relationship breakup i became close to a group of students and entered into a sexual relationship with one of the students
3131613 the past seven months have been the worst in my life i felt so ashamed for what i did to my school and my departments also my family i really let everyone down i have felt i deserved everything coming to me
3131614 ive talked to my mum quite a bit and the phones ringing and theres a lot of media interest and of course its just my mum in christchurch shes not equipped to deal with something of this magnitude not that shes not capable its just that its so surreal that all of a sudden she gets drawn into this he said
3131615 we have a small family in new zealand but were tight i know shes hurting and shes very much a part of the broader picture
3131616 our two families were very close and it is a good in law relationship shes rocked its hard for all of us
3131617 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me he said
3131618 i am passionate about the game my job i enjoy coaching volleyball has been wonderful to elisabeth and i but at this stage its very easy for me to focus on the task at hand which is taking care of my immediate family
3131619 once weve got it taken care of we can look at other things in life but right now thats purely where my focus is
3131620 the one thing that has been incredible has been the huge groundswell of support to help us pick up the pieces and help us manage this difficult situation as best as we can he said
3131621 interest has been global but in no way have we exposed ourselves with dealing with our emails and our phonecalls or anything like that its just too overwhelming we appreciate that everyone is with us we are just in no capacity to deal with that right now
3131622 stood for all the right things and he lived them
3131623 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence there is no indication her that there was an pre meditation it seems unfortunately to be a case of the wrong place at the wrong time certainly in our opinion that is the way it seems to be he said
3131624 it hurts its its something that no one should have to got through lifes not fair so its never going to be about that kind of stuff
3131625 at the end of the day it happened and it seems the the sooner we can come to grips with that and kind of process it the better off were going to be anger isnt an emotion im going to allow myself to indulge in
3131626 acted out of despair over personal failures the official xinhua news agency quoted police as saying
3131627 certainly the team has been influenced by this its not exactly how you would want to prepare for your first match having to deal with a tragedy of this nature
3131628 we will have access to more accurate and more rapid information to enable us to issue a tsunami alert
3131629 within 30 seconds around 90 percent of the information reaches the tsunami warning centre in tokyo the average speed for other systems is around 180 seconds
3131630 ik zeg dit om paniek onder de burgers van tbilisi te voorkomen als er enige bedreiging is van de veiligheid van tbilisi dan zullen wij dat ongeveer twaalf uur van tevoren weten
3131631 wij hebben en hadden nooit enige plannen om op te rukken naar tbilisi
3131632 i was hoping you could change the title on my car over to my name
3131633 phil do you think youll need any help with this one
3131634 oh im sorry miss i just thought i could give phil a hand and get you out of here a lot quicker we feel its best to get the customer the fast service necessary to get he or she back on his or her way
3131635 i think i can handle this one myself why dont you and the others go ahead to lunch
3131636 i forgot it was twelve thirty dont you all take the same lunch hour
3131637 i thought i could stay and help you out if thats all right with you
3131638 are you sure this is the dmv i mean i just moved here this year and ive never actually been
3131639 are you sure this dmv stands for department of motor vehicles is this a different dmv
3131640 yes it does and no it isnt this is exactly where you need to be miss
3131641 all the odds and ends are covered now all i need is your signature and well be done
3131642 im sorry i couldnt get you through any quicker but my hands and mind arent what they used to be
3131643 thats not what i meant i thought maybe thered be something more
3131644 if theres nothing else i can help you with today ms jones then i hope you dont mind if i have lunch
3131645 as long as i can stay and talk with you for a minute
3131646 now that i think about it maybe you want to go have lunch in back with your coworkers
3131647 no i usually stay out here anyway in case someone shows up
3131648 were allotted an hour for lunch but it only takes me about ten minutes might as well be out here and ready for the next customer
3131649 do you mind if i ask you a couple of questions
3131650 i figured that but how did you get to be so desperate
3131651 because i wanted to help people its all ive ever wanted to do and with my eyesight and looks i thought this might be the only place i could make a serious dent here perhaps i can do the best i can to serve with honor and commitment and help out a few harried citizens in need plus
3131652 i dont know why i find this all so difficult to believe
3131653 i aint fillin shit for you lady you took a real cute spill and screwed up my line nice and fine now ive got to use up my one sanctioned break mopping up your filthy blood
3131654 if you think im wasting my time and gas to haul your ass you got another thing comin like im gonna drive you to the meat factory then come all the way back to this hellhole just so i can punch in for another three hours you must be dreamin lady
3131655 ambulance is on the way dont worry your little head although its not like were liable
3131656 people have convinced me this ranking is really a way of paying homage to our teams of the last four five and six years lineweaver said
3131657 when you look at it that way it is a great feather in our cap
3131658 you always have to adjust if you want to play football its a little different here at lincoln but they welcomed us with open arms
3131659 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
3131660 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
3131661 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
3131662 i like to have him but were going to be ok
3131663 i hope we could reach an agreement as much as possible
3131664 these talks will break off unless both sides fulfil earlier promises
3131665 were there to listen to understand what happened he said monday adding that the police would like
3131666 one thing is for sure we have to do better than what weve been doing
3131667 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3131668 what we are seeing are youngsters a community that is in revolt because they dont like they way they are being treated
3131669 has the proliferation of intranet had a positive or negative effect on working paradigms within business organization
3131670 siemens is one of the companies in europe best known for its language training policies all its employees 40 percent outside germany have the opportunity to learn english german french and spanish at the companys expense
3131671 the better our language proficiency the better will we be able to operate in that language
3131672 there is no significant difference between the learning transfer of both public and privately owned firms
3131673 das hei t nicht plastik plastiken sind das was der bildhauer macht und im englischen gibts auch kein plastic f r kunststoffe denn dort hei t das plastics mit s hintendran mehrzahl
3131674 oh theres 600 in there aislinnmarie and i see youre into the computers you could go out and buy yourself one of your own internets
3131675 i dont have any problems eff yall oh yeah and dont mess with texas
3131676 now no one wants to come here except the few people who live in countries so horrible and yet not absolutely locked down that they can leave and come here
3131677 i see america as a nation that is a world leader that has got great values and leverage i dont think you should look at the relationship as one of leverage
3131678 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion
3131679 maoists cant run the government if they are put in a wheelchair with their hands and feet tied together
3131680 it is early in the process to know the kind of damage so we dont really know a dollar figure
3131681 theres also the question of how much of the damage was insured apparently there are quite a few renters in the neighbourhood and many of them did not have tenants insurance
3131682 for as long as you cant operate and youre not making the money that you would normally make theres insurance coverage for that
3131683 its too late after the event to adjust your coverage to cover that sort of thing but the main thing is to get the claim in and hear what your personal situation is from your insurance company
3131684 in the meantime youve got to look after yourself as if you were not insured and youve got to make sure that any damages are mitigated by any actions you can take
3131685 has the proliferation of intranet had a positive or negative effect on working paradigms within business organization
3131686 the people are being pushed towards a revolution the indian government is not serious about resolving the kashmir issue
3131687 we do not have a single ampoule remaining in the central store on the wards they are some but the situation is dangerous
3131688 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimag the real motive is a complete islamisation sic of the valley
3131689 we each have a duty this is my duty i chose it
3131690 i felt much more attracted to women and just felt like a man but i knew i was not lesbian
3131691 if todays athletes say they want to take the risk they really dont know what risk they are taking
3131692 dia moreno sudah cukup tahu apa yang akan dia lakukan
3131693 seluruhnya ada enam gram kurang lebih tapi tidak bagian kepemilikan satu orang bersama sama
3131694 mungkin baru kali ini mengalami seperti ini ditahan di kantor polisi dengan dugaan kasus narkoba
3131695 di jakarta aku nggak akan macam macem nggak akan bandel
3131696 ive been trying to withdraw my salary since yesterday morning i dont have a shekel in my pocket
3131697 in the past if there was a crisis the bank would let me withdraw a limited amount but this is the first time ive been told there is no money
3131698 when the monarchy ended and a popular government was installed under the leadership of sheikh abdullah the power base shifted to the valley of kashmir which has a larger population than jammu
3131699 i warned indias first prime minister jawaharlal nehru of the consequences of the simmering discontent in jammu soon after the states accession to india
3131700 its ironical that kashmiris who dont even consider themselves to be indians are getting all the blessings of the government while the people of jammu are always treated as second class citizens
3131701 conspiracy to reduce the majority community in jammu and kashmir into a minority
3131702 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
3131703 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
3131704 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3131705 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3131706 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3131707 the uighurs are driving cars and motorcycles they have shops but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3131708 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3131709 there may be just a rising sense of resentment and disgruntlement that have led to these attacks on the police
3131710 this is the best period in history in terms of education medical care and religion
3131711 he wants to play for the yankees so he can get at the red sox
3131712 i want to finish my career with the red sox
3131713 i want to play for the yankees to get back at the sox for paying me 160 million dollars and putting up with my crap for 7 and a half seasons
3131714 anybody in baseball knows that visiting with dr andrews raises much concern for a pitchers future
3131715 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3131716 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3131717 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3131718 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3131719 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3131720 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3131721 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3131722 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3131723 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3131724 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3131725 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3131726 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3131727 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3131728 i just couldnt get myself into shape we italians havent got used to competition in the morning
3131729 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3131730 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3131731 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3131732 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3131733 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3131734 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3131735 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3131736 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3131737 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3131738 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3131739 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3131740 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3131741 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3131742 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3131743 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3131744 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3131745 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3131746 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3131747 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3131748 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3131749 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3131750 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3131751 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3131752 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3131753 play ball with russia tovariches or we shove bat up freezing european fundaments this winter
3131754 when a man and wife conceive a baby two half lifes combine to make one full life
3131755 the world would be a better place if there were scientific data reported in the lifestyle sections of the new york times
3131756 few are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts
3131757 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3131758 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3131759 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3131760 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3131761 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3131762 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3131763 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3131764 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3131765 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3131766 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3131767 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3131768 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3131769 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3131770 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3131771 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3131772 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3131773 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3131774 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3131775 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3131776 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3131777 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3131778 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3131779 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3131780 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3131781 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3131782 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3131783 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3131784 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3131785 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3131786 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3131787 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3131788 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3131789 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3131790 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3131791 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3131792 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3131793 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3131794 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3131795 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3131796 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3131797 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3131798 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3131799 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3131800 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3131801 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3131802 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3131803 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3131804 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3131805 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3131806 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3131807 a mulher mais bela do mundo depois de sua mulher
3131808 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3131809 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3131810 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3131811 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3131812 lord i am not worthy to receive you but only say the word and i shall be healed
3131813 lord i am not worthy that you should enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed
3131814 let your spirit come upon these gifts to make them holy
3131815 make holy therefore these gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them like the dewfall
3131816 christ has died christ is risen christ will come again
3131817 lord i am not worthy to receive you but only say the word and i shall be healed
3131818 lord i am not worthy that you should enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed
3131819 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3131820 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3131821 i dont think anyone saw it being as relevant or as critical as it is right now
3131822 all of these internet channels have given bands more a reason to make a video because they can instantly upload to a place where their fans can see it and there is at least a chance someone else will see it
3131823 everyone knows making music is one of the most amazingly fun things you can do with your time and making a video is just another part of that it might be vain or silly or hard to justify in terms of how much it can cost and where it actually pushes a bands career but thats all shifting and negligible anyway
3131824 has to be an extension of creativity producing something to be a promotional tool is transparent as hell i think that its a great way to close the gap between band and audience because a video is the band in person its very human and inviting
3131825 we wanted to add value to the release and including videos is a good way to do that
3131826 it was also interesting because even though they are our songs the tunes had been reworked by the remixers to a point that we could approach them from a fresh perspective it was sort of like doing videos for someone else as opposed to us it was a good opportunity to get various friends and band members involved with shooting illustrating animating editing them
3131827 the song is sort of vignettes of the apocalypse and the director don tyler interpreted the lyrics into this kind of drugged out shotgun wedding in the garden of eden thing orchestrated by a maestro with a head made of cotton
3131828 we actually had no aspirations to do one but someone came to us with a cool idea that was free so we said yeah
3131829 the pop project likes jokes so we made a video to showcase that
3131830 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3131831 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3131832 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3131833 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3131834 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3131835 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3131836 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3131837 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3131838 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3131839 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3131840 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3131841 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3131842 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3131843 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3131844 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3131845 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3131846 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3131847 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3131848 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3131849 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3131850 it was a vicious attack there was a lot of blood and i think in any interpretation that was a frenzied attack
3131851 they were two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get a good education
3131852 they had both worked hard while at newcastle university and both had done extremely well graduating with good degrees
3131853 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more
3131854 it is a tough area but convenient for the university sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country
3131855 the content of these sites is not controlled by the mccain campaign and may contain offensive material please use your discretion in visiting these sites
3131856 that in essence is the mccain campaigns pitch to supporters to join its new online effort one that combines the features of
3131857 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3131858 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3131859 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3131860 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3131861 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3131862 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3131863 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3131864 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3131865 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3131866 saya tidak mahu ulas itu sahaja komen saya khabar angin boleh datang dan pergi tetapi kita begini juga
3131867 esses estudos sobre mudan as clim ticas est o nos levando a 220 projetos de adapta es para essas novas situa es que est o previstas
3131868 o brasil tem condi es de continuar crescendo entre 5 e 6 ao ano em termos de safra
3131869 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3131870 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3131871 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3131872 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3131873 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3131874 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3131875 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3131876 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3131877 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3131878 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3131879 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3131880 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3131881 you seem awefully relaxed did you notice what was going on outside
3131882 yep still cant sell you a gun without the waiting period sorry
3131883 there are undead swarming your streets and some sort of unexplained eclipse and youre worried about that
3131884 thats fine i just need a box of 357 ammo winchester 125grain jhp rounds i could probably use speedloader or two as well if you have the right ones for the colt detective special
3131885 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
3131886 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3131887 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3131888 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3131889 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3131890 there was advice that we received from the security consultants that it might be better not to start the competition from the 11th and move to the 12th
3131891 it is a strong possibility that we will reduce the champions trophy to two venues but the event will be played in pakistan
3131892 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3131893 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3131894 now were focused on the weak demand side of the equation
3131895 there was this thought process that the high price of energy didnt matter to china and other countries but were finding that thats not the case
3131896 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3131897 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3131898 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3131899 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3131900 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3131901 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3131902 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3131903 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3131904 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3131905 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3131906 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3131907 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3131908 o que a for a a rea brasileira est fazendo para ocultar as falhas do sistema a reo prender todos os que as apontam
3131909 o pa s precisando de controladores e a aeron utica transfere alguns dos melhores profissionais para fun es que n o tem nada que ver com o controle do tr fego a reo
3131910 ele est com problemas psicol gicos com suspeita de hepatite e n o consegue se tratar ele chegou a perder 17 quilos covarde a persegui o que ele e a febracta est o sofrendo
3131911 j n o mais uma quest o institucional de cumprir o regulamento mas sim um retalia o covarde e mesquinha a coisa com ele pessoal
3131912 it is not right to put an ad on your beauty it is not healthy for everything to be for sale this is a cultural sickness
3131913 i really never thought i would see ads on your superhero journal i wont read it anymore because i am tired and sickened by the selling of america you can paint it and dress it in pearls but thats what this is ads ads ads i feel so sad
3131914 i am opposed to advertising impacting every aspect of our existence and i wish more of us would keep boundaries around our creative space and say this is not for sale
3131915 although now that he is all famous and everything he no longer plays coffee shops so i dont like him as much
3131916 i dont know the key to success but the key to failure is trying to please everybody
3131917 est bamos patrullando un barrio de fallujah cuna de varios ataques violentos en los ltimos tiempos buscando informaci n y armas relacionadas con al qaeda en irak de repente un mensaje lleg por la radio tenemos un muerto y dos heridos qu dense donde est n los saldos comenzaron a hablar entre ellos cuando un comandante entr de repente vamos mu vanse ya agarramos muestro equipamiento armadura cascos guantes gafas y dem s cosas y salimos corriendo de la casa

3131919 una docena de personas perdieron la vida entre los que hab a chicos abuelos ciudadanos polic as y militares la escena fue terror fica m s all de las palabras incluso para alguien como yo acostumbrado a vivir en el umbral de estas cosas
3131920 es una guerra y no podemos retratar s lo a soldados distribuyendo caramelos tambi n hay que mostrar la muerte
3131921 present im genes que mostraron una vista sin censura de un evento terrible con una peque a medida de dignidad para aquellos que perdieron sus vidas
3131922 esper tres d as antes de publicarlas me asegur de que los cuerpos no eran identificables y que las familias estuviesen informadas

3131924 im not interested in any government post i just want to do my own thing
3131925 i am still a division chief and i do not want people to speculate as my commitment is to umno and its leadership under datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi
3131926 i dont want to be tied up with government duties
3131927 im leaving the matter in the hands of the prime minister
3131928 i was a deputy minister for two terms and since i cannot go any further i feel it is time to move on
3131929 it is a normal reaction for anybody to look elsewhere when they are not going anywhere
3131930 i am happy to perhaps venture into business and serve the people in my constituency
3131931 there is no need for me to send any letter i just have to inform him that i decline the post
3131932 i have already been a deputy minister for two terms and i feel its time for me to make way for a younger person to hold this post
3131933 i thank the prime minister for appointing me but i have decided not to accept it
3131934 if you are on the enemys side or you are being used by enemies stop it
3131935 when somebody makes you turn against each other you dont say we are no longer family members
3131936 14 hours of discussion means there is some kind of disagreement if it was an agreement it would have been in two hours
3131937 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3131938 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3131939 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3131940 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3131941 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3131942 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3131943 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3131944 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3131945 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3131946 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3131947 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3131948 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3131949 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3131950 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3131951 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3131952 just so you all know we did set a record
3131953 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3131954 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3131955 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3131956 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place
3131957 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3131958 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3131959 we operate on a private practice model so that individuals who come are assigned their own providers their own doctors their own nurse practitioners
3131960 in america 17 million people get their care from community healthcare centers
3131961 these centers are part of the answer to the healthcare crisis in america today
3131962 the clinic does provide a lot of services for diabetics
3131963 if everything goes well i think in a couple days
3131964 i feel like ive been making good progress every day taking a good step forward each time
3131965 forth of high notions and great words yet in the meantime there was no care how to provide food for hungry souls
3131966 dang i hope they dont mess up atlanta too bad
3131967 hey i didnt get no fortune cookie after lunch today
3131968 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3131969 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3131970 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3131971 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3131972 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3131973 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3131974 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3131975 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3131976 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3131977 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3131978 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3131979 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3131980 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3131981 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3131982 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3131983 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3131984 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3131985 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3131986 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3131987 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3131988 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3131989 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3131990 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3131991 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3131992 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3131993 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3131994 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3131995 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3131996 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3131997 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3131998 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3131999 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3132000 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3132001 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3132002 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3132003 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3132004 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3132005 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3132006 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3132007 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3132008 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3132009 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3132010 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3132011 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3132012 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3132013 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3132014 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3132015 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3132016 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3132017 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3132018 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3132019 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3132020 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3132021 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3132022 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3132023 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3132024 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for

3132026 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3132027 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3132028 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3132029 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3132030 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3132031 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3132032 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3132033 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3132034 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3132035 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3132036 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3132037 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3132038 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3132039 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3132040 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3132041 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3132042 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3132043 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3132044 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3132045 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3132046 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3132047 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3132048 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3132049 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
3132050 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
3132051 why are the oil companies selling off our good american crude to foreign countries when we need it so badly
3132052 this is a slap on the face of iraq we couldnt make a big change in the government structure that pushed us to work to make change in the provincial council but even that we cant touch
3132053 is deadly serious about returning to war against all the islamic parties sunni and shia if the awakening groups are not given the power they think they deserve
3132054 i would say it is influenced by life and pretty boys
3132055 oh sorry i messed something up can you please be patient for one minute and ill be right with you
3132056 wtf ive already been here for like 20 minutes sitting next to a lady with 105 screaming kids and now i have to wait longer
3132057 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3132058 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3132059 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3132060 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3132061 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3132062 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3132063 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3132064 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3132065 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3132066 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3132067 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3132068 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3132069 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3132070 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3132071 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3132072 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3132073 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3132074 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3132075 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3132076 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3132077 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3132078 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3132079 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3132080 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3132081 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3132082 this team showed a lot of character in the game
3132083 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3132084 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3132085 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3132086 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3132087 it was a heckuva accomplishment especially for a small town team
3132088 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3132089 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3132090 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3132091 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3132092 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3132093 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3132094 empez como una especie de tributo a las personas que cayeron en nuestro negocio como layne staley y muchas otras que murieron algo as como los m rtires del rock and roll y todo creci desde ah el concepto es que nosotros vamos a morir en alg n momento y es algo de lo que nadie habla nadie quiere sacarlo a la luz es el elefante blanco viviendo en nuestro cuarto pero todos tenemos que lidiar con eso en alg n punto
3132095 likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know what to pray for as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words and he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god

3132121 umm rosa if you can see this im having a fantasyfan part 2 contest later today
3132122 hi there diddy this is psycho shanon with the ryan seacrest show you were supposed to be on our show today because allegedly your flight got delayed but i dont believe you and because you didnt call you ruined our entire show and now ryan hates you and um awkward pause im not psycho shanon um o kay then we played the psycho shanon its my show theme song i think its safe to say that well never have diddy on our show now i hate to say this because normally i try to be nice to listeners despite what people would have you believe but so far rosas appearance on the show left much to be desired and certainly not worthy of a trip to playa del carmen thats right you read correctly a trip to playa but dont get it twisted it wasnt a prize or even a reward from kkitm this was all courtesy of big al mack though im not sure what for maybe he felt bad for making her mow his lawn and pick up dog poop or maybe as the chat room mrs al mack said
3132123 whatever it was it still didnt elicit an interesting response i wonder what wouldve happened if he had told her she had just won the lottery im guessing nothing and lest you think my critique too harsh tigertony 07 said

3132129 but weve got to keep the city moving forecasts tell us that car use is set to increase congestion levels will get much worse and ultimately over the next 20 years oil production is going to peak any city that does not plan to meet these challenges is not planning ahead for sustainable growth people all over the uk are beginning to wake up to the fact that weve got to reduce our reliance on the car congestion already costs our local economy 160m every year the traffic jams are literally putting the brakes on our competitiveness and if left unchecked our city could grind to halt in a fume filled traffic jam not good for businesses not good for residents not good for anybody even those driving the cars
3132130 the levy isnt an additional tax or convenient revenue generator its a demand management tool which is directly linked to real and tangible benefits and part of a coherent set of measures that give genuine alternatives to those traveling
3132131 alternative funding sources could and may contribute towards public transport in nottingham however these sources dont offer a viable alternative to the levy as they require further legislation or are limited in the level of funding they generate
3132132 ultimately the vast majority of congestion in nottingham is caused by commuters driving to a free parking space at one of the 500 large employers of the public and private sectors i believe its only fair that these larger employers stop being part of todays problem and start being part of tomorrows solution
3132133 and lets be clear the levy is a charge on the employer not the staff its up to the employers to decide whether to pass the charge on the levy also wont apply to businesses with ten or fewer parking spaces because they are more likely to be younger or smaller businesses which we need to encourage and support
3132134 last year 68 of nottingham city residents who took part in the consultation supported the levy and the transport benefits it will bring of course there are those who objected there always will be but here in nottingham were prepared to take tough decisions for the long term benefit of the city and thats exactly what the levy does

3132186 i had heard of this going on in other states but im really disappointed this is happening to the courts in our state
3132187 this is a real indication there are two systems one for the rich
3132188 one thing we need to remember is that the judges who are signing those orders are elected and the court clerks are elected if we want our records to stay open and stay available we need to be aware of who we are electing as court clerks and judges open government needs to be the issue
3132189 it gives the appearance that justice is for sale in oklahoma like it was 50 years ago
3132190 on occasion there is a valid reason to seal a court record but it should be an extreme rarity if the public pays for our court system then we ought to know who its being used for if you want privacy settle your affairs in private

3132212 ive never seen our comps this low in the 30 years since i started the company
3132213 and there are enough retailers to pick up the surplus
3132214 its like pouring a gallon of water into a half gallon jug theres going to be an overflow but the grocers are loving it because sales per square foot have gone through the roof and many retailers are doing better business than ever
3132215 but its an issue a lot of people are not comfortable talking about
3132216 a lot of the neighborhoods without grocery stores are neighborhoods where the operators didnt want to go back after katrina so there are voids in a lot of areas
3132217 there are certain communities where operators can find good locations and where their stores would be well received there are definitely pockets where new stores would be very much appreciated

3132225 national enquirer alleges john edwards affair blogosphere readies salt shaker
3132226 does it matter if the ny times time and nbc news dont report it if mid level metropolitan papers and bloggers do
3132227 the enquirer story though uncorroborated by others has been seen by millions on political blogs and is joke fodder for jay leno
3132228 if edwards is really certain he isnt the father of the kid wouldnt he have demanded a paternity test to clear his name
3132229 the decent option is to tell the public the whole truth without lawyerly equivocations
3132230 all the participants in a typical malpractice case will be represented
3132231 some will play their regular career roles such as the attorneys and the judge while others will become actors and take part as the defendant victims family witnesses or jurors
3132232 the case will demonstrate to the students the tremendous responsibility that the public places on the pharmacist to protect and enhance the health of patients
3132233 it is going to be a very eye opening experience for the student pharmacists
3132234 some members of the universitys mock trial competitive team will serve as the jury along with several staff from the harrison school of pharmacy
3132235 as student pharmacists observe there will be open deliberations so everyone can hear the process of coming to a decision of guilty or not guilty if the defendant is found guilty then the jury will deliberate on the damages
3132236 der rnf hat sich aus der motivation der frauen selbst gebildet da ist niemand gekommen der gesagt hat mach doch mal so was
3132237 institutionalisierte politik ist f r frauen einfach nicht so das bet tigungsfeld wir treffen uns und sprechen sehr viel inhaltlich
3132238 sie haben am infostand mehr erfolg bei der kontaktaufnahme zu passanten und sie bernehmen immer st rker arbeiten in den vorst nden
3132239 es ist nie so gewesen dass m nner sie verhindert oder daran gehindert h tten im gegenteil ich habe berall in der partei erlebt dass wenn frauen sich zur wahl gestellt haben sie berall den bonus bekommen haben
3132240 frauen in der rechten szene sind wie ein spiegelbild der gesellschaft das hei t sie k nnen ein traditionelles rollenmodell leben berufst tige m tter oder emanzipiert sein oder sogar gewaltbereit agieren
3132241 auch frauen sind politische akteurinnen sie gehen weit seltener als ihnen nachgesagt wird in die szene weil ihnen die jungs gefallen oder weil sie es dort besonders nett finden oder sie dort besonders hofiert werden sie gehen dahin weil sie rechts sind und rechte positionen haben f r die sie einstehen und k mpfen wollen
3132242 m nner und frauen sind f r uns nicht gleich sondern verschieden vom wesen her wir sehen im gender projekt das tiefgr ndigere interesse frauen und m nner gleichzuschalten v llig die identit ten zu verwischen alles austauschbar zu machen
3132243 unserer meinung nach ist sie im dienste der wirtschaft unterwegs um frauen als billige arbeitskr fte auf den markt zu holen
3132244 wir holen den armen l ndern die ihre fachkr fte eigentlich selbst zum aufbau ihrer wirtschaft brauchen die leute weg
3132245 ich sehe das wie einen teller mit knete wenn ich es zusammenmatsche bleibt am ende nur braun brig oder grau kulturen sind gewachsen aus v lkern und nicht weil v lkergruppen ausgetauscht worden sind
3132246 v lker sind nach der familie die wirksamsten gemeinschaften wie jede zu sch tzende pflanze und tierart sind sie eine bereicherung
3132247 was wir voraussehen ist ein kampf der kulturen der wird kommen und dann kann man sich nichts mehr sch n reden
3132248 wir sind anders wir t fteln nicht nur irgendwelche ref rmchen aus sondern wir haben eben einen ganz anderen ansatz des lebens wir versuchen heimatliebe naturliebe aber eben auch verbundenheit zur tradition und zur kultur in unserem leben umzusetzen
3132249 mein ex mann hatte die idee am 20 april zu heiraten das ist nat rlich eine provokation gewesen
3132250 frauen werden untersch tzt auch was ihre berufswahl angeht es ist in den unis schulen und kinderg rten noch nicht angekommen dass dort rechte sch lerinnen und studentinnen sitzen k nnten dass es welche gibt die ganz bewusst einen beruf ergreifen um die n chste generation mit ihrem gedankengut in kontakt zu bringen
3132251 aufgrund der zuschreibung dass frauen keine so politische haltung zugetraut wird kommen sie viel weiter mit ihrer unterwanderungsstrategie
3132252 wenn sie bei einer rnf versammlung w ren w rden sie 90 prozent der frauen rein vom u eren her nicht als national einstufen die meisten frauen w rden sie nicht erkennen
3132253 nat rlich hat man es einfacher wenn die leute einen erstmal als menschen kennen lernen und erleben wie man ist ohne vorurteile
3132254 i think i screamed at the top of my lungs three times and i thought oh no i cant play the rest of the season i knew it was broken
3132255 i was on the sidelines cheering on my team and trying to help but it was very unbearable i had never been in the position of not being able to do something
3132256 i was planning on coming back but it motivated me even more to do my best and win a championship
3132257 it does get sore and after the game it hurts to walk on it but the brace helps
3132258 we would like to return to the ontarios this year we have a very deep team again this year with lots of seniors

3132263 it is early in the process to know the kind of damage so we dont really know a dollar figure
3132264 theres also the question of how much of the damage was insured apparently there are quite a few renters in the neighbourhood and many of them did not have tenants insurance
3132265 for as long as you cant operate and youre not making the money that you would normally make theres insurance coverage for that
3132266 its too late after the event to adjust your coverage to cover that sort of thing but the main thing is to get the claim in and hear what your personal situation is from your insurance company
3132267 in the meantime youve got to look after yourself as if you were not insured and youve got to make sure that any damages are mitigated by any actions you can take
3132268 we recognize that theres a need to properly monitor individuals who are on parole in the federal system
3132269 literally every moment of the day a persons location can be verified
3132270 this protects our citizens this protects our children from potential problems
3132271 we believe we can do this without violating the rights of a violent offender
3132272 we art pleased to share the knowledge and expertise we have gained over the past two years with the government of canada
3132273 from shotgun shell ornaments to monster truck tree toppers spiked eggnog treats and rockin reindeer games anything goes as long as its ringing with redneck joy
3132274 i am proud of the sonus team for delivering revenue in the high end of our original q2 outlook and earnings that exceeded expectations
3132275 mobile phones are without question the most underutilized computing platform in the world
3132276 despite the fact that billions of phones are able to run applications industry research shows that less than 5 percent of mobile subscribers around the world are actually running third party applications on their phones cascada mobile believes there are two main reasons why this number is so low first that conditions for mobile application development are a huge challenge limiting the number of mobile developers and applications and second that there are few resources for finding applications that are of interest to subscribers the breeze platform and breeze apps portal solve both halves of this mobile application problem
3132277 we are pleased to have taken delivery of m v tupi maiden which increases our operating fleet to 45 vessels this delivery further enhances our ability to generate revenues and stable cash flows while implementing our strategy of growing our fleet in response to the growth of our business
3132278 although universals earnings in the current quarter were less than last years level the company continued to generate profitable results during the second quarter of 2008 despite heightened competition and decreased premium rates as a result of the continued profitability the company strengthened its balance sheet with an increase in stockholders equity and announced a 3 0 million stock buyback plan on june 25
3132279 the company remains committed to its growth plan and we are pleased to have been recently admitted to write property and casualty insurance in south carolina furthermore we are optimistic that we will receive our licenses for texas hawaii georgia and north carolina over the next six months
3132280 d amp e is continually looking to enhance shareholder value
3132281 at current price levels we believe d amp es stock may offer an attractive investment opportunity and be a good use of available cash for the company
3132282 we look forward to opening our first store in georgia and serving the atlanta area
3132283 i enjoy seeing the reaction of our customers when they first enter our stores smell the leather and see the incredible array of products when i see that positive reaction i know that we have achieved our goal of creating an outstanding retail shopping experience for avid equestrians
3132284 purio has operated the down scaled model of our patented technology using a variety of water samples and that exercise has proven the units ability to produce fresh clear safe drinking water from contaminated and unsafe sources our next step is to prove the results in a recognized and accepted format which is only possible through an independent recognized lab
3132285 as a further demonstration of the units ability around mid week we are preparing to move the unit to a new location at a shallow lake near a recreational resort village to show the transportability of the unit and its ability to produce safe water from a variety of sources
3132286 we will also be ordering and reporting on a complete battery of lab analysis on that operation as well
3132287 because our technology clarifies water without the use of membranes we have captured the attention of interested parties from around the world some have admitted their skepticism that they dont believe that our claims are possible through our operations and testing through this week and the following accredited lab reports we intend to make believers out of even the most discriminating observers the economical processing methods we use may open doors of possibilities for thirsty communities and companies around the world who simply wont accept unsafe drinking water any longer

3132290 nem fudendo to cansado cheguei agora de viagem ent o vamos pedir uma pizza
3132291 i am pleased with our financial results for the second quarter of 2008 which were driven by the high fleet utilization levels we attained for yet another quarter
3132292 in the span of 16 months since going public we have grown oceanfreight from a fleet of seven bulk carriers to a fleet of twelve vessels comprised of nine bulk carriers and three crude oil tankers while maintaining a prudent leverage structure we have declared five consecutive quarterly dividends totaling 3 21 per share we believe that our high time charter coverage will enable us to continue to pay quarterly dividends consistent with our dividend policy our annualized dividend yield based on the closing price of 17 36 on august 8th stands at 18 currently we have fixed under time charter employment 97 of our remaining operating days in 2008 94 in 2009 and 60 in 2010 basis mid point redeliveries the average remaining duration of our contracts is approximately 2 3 years which translates into significant visibility and predictability we remain committed to our stated business strategy since we went public of seeking opportunities to grow and diversify our fleet within multiple shipping sectors while we aim to deliver consistent returns to our shareholders
3132293 the non cash intangible asset charge that we recognized this quarter stems from the 2002 acquisition of conestoga enterprises inc including two of its rural local exchange carriers conestoga telephone and buffalo valley telephone
3132294 a portion of the purchase price was allocated at that time to the indefinite lived franchise intangible asset this asset reflects the value of estimated future cash flows from providing communication services to customers who move into these territories subsequent to the acquisition based on our most recent estimates of the regulated future cash flows from these customers we have determined that the value of the franchise intangible asset needed to be reduced this is a non cash charge and has no impact on our cash flow generated from operations excluding the franchise intangible asset charge and the reduction to wireline depreciation expense net income for the quarter increased approximately 7 over the second quarter of 2007 d amp e remains focused on broadband on net clec business and improvement in systems integration performance
3132295 systems integration continues on its improvement path operating income for the quarter was 8 000 compared to an operating loss of approximately 0 4 million in the second quarter of 2007 the fact that systems integration posted a quarter of operating income even though it was a modest amount demonstrates that the steps weve taken and the focus on execution in this segment are having a positive impact the 1 2 million improvement in operating income for the six months year to date in fiscal year 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 is further proof of their impact
3132296 vicor continues to be strategically well positioned despite worldwide economic uncertainty as anticipated due to booking trends in q1 and early q2 vicors revenue for the second quarter declined as the global economy softened revenue from our brick business unit experienced a roughly six percent decline sequentially however bookings in july including a first 3 2 million order for v i chip inside vibricks came in 35 ahead of april levels pointing to improving demand for our expanding brick product line also despite the decline in q2 revenue the brick units gross margin as a percentage of revenue actually increased from the q1 level
3132297 as previously discussed anticipated volume shipments of a major v i chip program were pushed out early this year as such revenue for v i chip declined roughly 27 from the prior quarter we had planned higher levels of v i chips shipments in q2 but now forecast ramping in q3 and q4 because we had put infrastructure in place to meet greater demand v i chip continues to absorb the costs of underutilized production capacity accordingly v i chip generated a higher operating loss for the quarter we remain confident v i chip will essentially double its top line in 2008 experience robust growth in 2009 and improve its gross margin with economies of scale our confidence is based on progress being made with early adopters and the ongoing expansion of relationships with licensees and partners bringing about a global presence and facilitating adoption of v i chips and factorized power
3132298 picor our fabless semiconductor unit recently announced its first family of cool oring power path management products addressing the requirements of redundant power architectures for high availability systems such as high end computing telecom communication and wireless infrastructure cool oring power management products reduce power dissipation eliminate the need for costly thermal management and reduce board level real estate versus conventional active oring solutions the introduction of this product family is a significant first step in picors synergistic product roadmap
3132299 of course we are disappointed to have experienced a net loss for the second quarter however temporarily high r amp d expenses applications engineering and marketing expenses and the margin drag caused by underutilized capacity represent appropriate investments in the development of our products and markets as discussed last quarter we expect overall revenue growth may remain modest until the first half of 2009 however early adopters have embraced our ability to address their power needs with high performance power components as building blocks of efficient power distribution and power systems vicor is well capitalized and with our brick business model and the momentum we are seeing in disruptive technology products pioneered by v i chip and picor well positioned for the future
3132300 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
3132301 we are very pleased to announce our first results and to declare our first dividend as a public company
3132302 during the second quarter 2008 our net income increased by 28 compared to the same period of 2007 reflecting both higher charter rates and a larger fleet size
3132303 we have benefited from a balanced chartering policy which provides us with a high level of contracted base cash flow but at the same time allows us to benefit from a continued strong market
3132304 we have taken advantage of our strong financial position to contract for the acquisition of a high quality newbuild post panamax class vessel this vessel acquisition which we announced in july 2008 will increase our fleet to 20 vessels after the delivery of all contracted newbuilds by the second half of 2010 given our young and modern fleet our strong cash flow generation and high time charter coverage we are confident that we will be able to meet our objectives to profitably grow our business and to increase our distributable cash flow per share in the coming years
3132305 the second quarter was highlighted by progress in the ramp up and expansion of our solar grade silicon production and shipments as we advance towards our planned nominal annual capacity of 14 400 metric tons
3132306 as anticipated we encountered a number of production challenges that are typical during the start up periods for complex industrial processes which impacted our output of solar grade silicon for the quarter purity of our material is paramount as we continuously refine our facilities in meeting our customers specifications based on our experience to date with the three new production lines commissioned earlier this year and process improvements that we plan to implement as we expand our solar grade silicon production capacity we have targeted output in the range of 1 200 to 1 500 metric tons for the current year

3132310 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered
3132311 an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
3132312 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
3132313 no one really knows yet if and when iran will get the system
3132314 we need to keep every option open if they provoke us or they attack us our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly

3132323 its a good day for indiana its a good day for the united states and its good day for the world to get one step closer to ridding ourselves of these heinous weapons
3132324 since these people work together to break the law we must work together to enforce the law

3132326 todd and barb bachman arent just hughs in laws theyre wizs parents great people who were close to ucla
3132327 the only comfort is that wiz was not injured in the heinous attack
3132328 todd and barb have been two of the most supportive and friendly people parents that i have ever encountered they have a genuine knack for making everyone welcome and continued their support of ucla volleyball even after wiz graduated
3132329 in four years they probably missed fewer than a half a dozen matches
3132330 they became like parents to the whole team because they were always there always supporting everyone
3132331 everyone on the current team knows wiz she coached a camp here a couple years ago and coached dicey mcgraw an outside hitter from santa margarita high for the junior olympics were just trying to keep it together right now
3132332 during this tremendously difficult time we have been blessed to be surrounded by a tremendous support system of caring individuals and organizations

3132360 the fact that all the deaths went up but we could not find the specific cause may be because vitamin d plays a role in both cancer and heart disease and potentially other things

3132405 we honor the principle that a current spouse has no obligation to support someone elses child while accounting for the reality that the current spouse may provide economic resources to the household
3132406 the problem is new jersey does not give same sex couples like jim and mark odonnell the freedom to marry and to be legally equal spouses
3132407 when the law gives a couple responsibilities without equality the law must be changed

3132432 proud to be in his company yet while ridge as a running mate might boost mccains chances of carrying the keystone state in november conservatives worry about his impact on the vote of the partys base in other states

3132455 i am pleased the legislature overwhelmingly supports and recognizes the importance of local projects and am looking forward to working with town officials on these projects moving forward
3132456 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3132457 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3132458 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3132459 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3132460 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3132461 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
3132462 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall
3132463 its very much up to the administration to manage it in an effective manner
3132464 if you are irresponsible about that borrowing that can be a problem

3132475 we want people to easily find the best of the best thats out there
3132476 and if it has a gearaward seal on it that just makes it simpler to find a great service or product because weve done the footwork already
3132477 our judges felt like if a company like aquamantra can take something as simple and as healthy as water and turn it into something much more powerful without adding a bunch of junk they are certainly worthy of our top award
3132478 in this economy with issues concerning bottled water we believe our water is winning awards because we are rising above generic commerce
3132479 this is an important step to help us more completely link buyers and sellers in the farm equipment market and is the first of several announcements well make in the equipment sector yet this year

3132482 i dont think either of us are natural sprinters we dont do the 100m free so we are naturally suited to the back half of the race
3132483 we didnt panic when we were a little bit behind i didnt see anyone past katie i didnt know what was going on
3132484 i couldnt see what there was on the other side of the pool i saw katie and just tried to catch her
3132485 i dont think either of us expected it and especially a gold and a bronze its absolutely amazing

3132490 job growth matters but only if you could get it where jobs are needed the most we found that jobs had a bigger impact on reducing poverty in smaller metropolitan areas because if you live in a small area you can get to where the jobs are but if you live in columbus or cleveland or new york or atlanta it is going to be harder to get to the jobs

3132503 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3132504 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3132505 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3132506 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3132507 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3132508 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3132509 i felt much more attracted to women and just felt like a man but i knew i was not lesbian

3132511 the ratification of the joint collective bargaining agreement represents the culmination of many months of effort by everyone involved this historic milestone marks the first time that a labor agreement has been reached in advance of the close of an airline merger it is far superior to the traditional well worn labor role in that all pilots will receive financial returns from day one for the value we provide to the merger we look forward to participating in deltas future growth and success as our nations first truly global airline
3132512 this momentous vote broke the traditional merger paradigm because the pilot groups of northwest and delta were willing to make an affirmative decision we will have a joint contract that becomes effective on the date of corporate closing a seniority list process that provides a method to achieve a fair and equitable list and two pilot groups that will be unified to face the challenges ahead

3132515 the pilots precedent setting contributions will allow the merged company to take advantage of all the efficiencies as soon as possible and begin marketing the first global airline to our customers and wall street
3132516 we believe that the best seniority list solution is one that is resolved through negotiations by pilots working with pilots while we have confidence in the arbitration process we will remain open to a negotiated solution of a fair and equitable single seniority list

3132521 he can cover tight ends play defense play the run so im excited to have him
3132522 all i know is that in the past when anythings been taken away from erasmus hes always come back with a vengeance
3132523 and thats the plan he needs to come back with a vengeance wanting to establish himself as a good football player in this league
3132524 its always been a first round draft pick and trying to overcome injuries
3132525 its been pretty hard but i enjoy the patience the redskins have had and i feel like im ready to go out there and actually show what first round is
3132526 weve seen in the training room and the weight room that desire to get back healthy
3132527 he has definitely overachieved there were very hopeful thats going to carry over
3132528 it adds another very good football player into the mix
3132529 i dont want to judge erasmus too quickly weve got some other guys who have been pushing for some playing time as well so its nice to have that problem

3132556 systems that take the signature of a motor rotor and use it as an analysis tool are most useful when they calculate efficiency while the equipment is online
3132557 other alternatives require shutting the equipment down to perform a resistance test and then bringing it back online
3132558 less fanfare has been made of this technology recently perhaps because the market is saturated or the low hanging fruit has been picked issues such as inconsistent voltage supply and reverse harmonics will likely drive renewed attention to this and other motor efficiency and power quality solutions as energy costs continue to rise

3132607 this is a good strategic fit for us applocation designed their mobilefusion platform thinking much the same way we did they began with the end in mind it is a modular scalable interface that works with any wireless device ive seen it work and they got it right
3132608 we were looking to partner with someone who really knows the telematics and location based services business and could easily walk between the enterprise and consumer worlds
3132609 the combination of location and wireless connectivity can be powerful for both consumers and businesses for example we can deliver specific information and media to transit riders with mobilefusion and iamota if a transit rider is sitting in a downtown vancouver office on a rainy day and wants to know if the bus is going to be late it is possible to opt in for on time bus services better than that though by connecting location of the handset and the bus the rider can request messaging services to be advised if the bus is late and also be sent a coupon to have a beer at the nearest pub instead
3132610 adding location awareness and navigation capability to our iamota platform is a huge benefit for our customers connecting to the mobile world in real time where the user is with contextual media and location awareness gives global brands the power to deliver rich digital content that is customizable and delivered on an opt in basis

3132618 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3132619 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch
3132620 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3132621 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3132622 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3132623 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3132624 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3132625 most of them the majority of them 90 percent come with no exposure to masonry
3132626 a lady named marge set down many of the reasons she s tired of illegal aliens invading the united states of america no doubt every reader may add another dozen to the list from personal experiences
3132627 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3132628 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3132629 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3132651 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3132652 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3132653 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3132654 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3132655 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars

3132681 the stuff he brings to the table on and off the field is exactly what were looking for

3132729 there is no point in hiding from the fact that they beat us comprehensively on the three occasions in croke park recently
3132730 they are a serious outfit when they get to croke park they are a better team than they are in munster so we have to be a better team than we have been so far
3132731 people have pointed out the jekyll and hyde form of cork inside and outside of munster and we cannot afford any spell of lacklustre play against kerry or they will punish us
3132732 we should have pushed on from a very strong position
3132733 we were nine points up and top have it in the balance in the last minute is not good enough
3132734 it was their improvement and our sloppiness it was good to hold on in a tight finish but it should never have gone down to a tight finish setanta readers comment of the day

3132738 an expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field
3132739 this is a broader and more important collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models
3132740 the cells will allow researchers access for the first time to cell types of interest to watch the disease progress in a dish to watch what goes right or wrong well see in the years ahead that this opens the door to a new way of treating degenerative disease
3132741 that is where all of the science will go on over the next many many years
3132742 even though the ips methodology gives us a facile way for making disease specific lines it does not eliminate the value or need for continuing to study human embryonic stem cells
3132743 those are really the gold standard for pluripotent stem cell types they have no genetic modifications and at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue beyond that are going to be extremely valuable tools human embryonic stem cells allow you to ask questions that we never can ask with ips cells
3132744 whether or not were going to be able to figure out how to do it without viruses so we can use the cells therapeutically is as of today an unanswered question
3132745 im confident were going to get there and that within the next year or two we will have several strategies for reprogramming cells without viruses and when that happens we may have cells in our hands that may be valuable for cell replacement therapy
3132746 in these complex genetic diseases were so ignorant at the moment we dont even know if patients who get type 1 diabetes all get it the same way there could be 50 different ways to get type 1 diabetes

3132873 is to create landforms and water flows that streams can maintain naturally but how you translate that into action
3132874 first steps toward creating a green solution to onondaga lakes sewage issues
3132875 were hoping to utilize those funds to plant green infrastructure and also measure it and study it so we have a good idea of how much of it can be placed where to reduce the storm water runoff issues
3132876 there is no sense in planting a bunch of trees or rain gardens that arent getting supported
3132877 for our purposes it serves almost the entire near west side
3132878 where we can were looking to maximize projects that are already going on

3132897 whatever tensions and hostilities might have existed between georgians and ossetians they in no way justify moscows path of violent aggression

3132909 the only thing that matters is getting to product market fit
3132910 being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market
3132911 this is different than when another startup raises 5 million we wont rush out there and start hiring like mad we just wanted to have the funding issue taken care of so we could focus on the product and users
3132912 do whatever would make users love you so much that they spontaneously recommend you to their friends
3132913 figure out what the important things are and spend lots time on those and little on the rest lots of startups work very hard but on the wrong things they still die an untimely death
3132914 good things that will get you more revenue things that will get you more users and thus hopefully revenue things that will make your product better and thus hopefully more users things that will get you great hires and thus hopefully better products focusing on the right market bad going to events at business schools or networking with the people that do

3133016 would not open a single new acre for offshore drilling
3133017 well i think that we have plenty of places offshore and anwr as spots that we could but i think that it needs to be done judiciously
3133018 ive said that before and i still believe that now but i think that we do need to drill for oil
3133019 if you look at how little impact that has that has become a political football it has almost no effect on price
3133020 if you look at it in a study and look at what it does over the next ten years it will have almost no effect on price it almost does nothing about our consumption because we consume 30 percent of the worlds production nearly and we only make 3 percent so it cant do it
3133021 would someone in kentucky want to see our environment destroyed like we are asking to do in alaska i dont think so i think kentuckians are much more environmentally conscious than that
3133022 bruce supports drilling wherever it can be done in an environmentally sound way
3133023 its interesting that republicans have tried to use anwr as a wedge issue as a political football for many years if anwr was the golden nugget then mcconnell would have it in his plan
3133024 kentuckians like all americans are hard hit by record high gas prices these tough times call for creative solutions and i believe allowing kentuckians the option of using an electric vehicle is one of those solutions

3133031 for somebody who has been called elitist going to hawaii is not exactly going against type
3133032 if obamas being smeared as a highfalutin celebrity who is somehow other and distant from the american heartland is hawaii really the ideal vacation destination

3133034 american might is sinister soldiers are criminalized by war christians are intolerant and hypocritical housewives are desperate corporations are evil the environment is in mortal danger from wicked man and in general something is terribly wrong with mainstream society

3133036 when you get the best gas mileage of course you will not be loved in the oil sheikhdoms nissan tiida the japanese 1600 cc automatic transmission car with the best gas mileage
3133037 its my opinion that nissan made a huge error by igniting these racist instincts
3133038 we need to apply punishments against these things in order for nissan to keep its interests in the region it must apologize
3133039 if we have a sense of humor i expect them to have one as well

3133043 likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know what to pray for as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words and he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god

3133049 it doesnt look like this was premeditated with a massive staging of equipment
3133050 until the night before the fighting russia seemed to be playing a constructive role
3133051 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
3133052 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position

3133089 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place
3133090 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result

3133095 by choosing to travel by rail amtrak passengers are already a step ahead because the carbon footprint generated by their trip is smaller than that of most other modes of transportation
3133096 because it is more energy efficient traveling by rail contributes less per passenger mile to greenhouse gas emissions than either cars or airplanes rail travel also helps to reduce highway congestion in major urban centers

3133121 a choice between validating the same failed policy in iraq that has cost us so many lives and demanding a new one
3133122 we must fund our troops but we owe them something more we owe them a clear prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone elses civil war we need a plan to compel the iraqi people to reach a political accommodation and to take responsibility for their own future its time to change course
3133123 you also begin to observe who came to compete this year there are a lot of guys that have done that in the past so unless they go backwards you are in good shape that way theres always somebody ready to jump up and get into the race
3133124 you want to teach the proper fundamentals of blocking and tackling
3133125 you want to get the habit of doing it really well and start it out right even if you are a great tackler if you dont do it right from the beginning its hard
3133126 they are physically in very good condition and theyre strong
3133127 its been a long process especially in the weight room trying to get my leg stronger and trying to get back on the field
3133128 just trying to stay healthy has been a battle not just from my leg but from other injuries too
3133129 the reason i came here was to play football so it would be pointless for me to come here and get hurt and then just quit like that that would be too easy id rather keep pushing
3133130 its been tough because when i got hurt i worried that i wouldnt be able to ever play
3133131 when some people get hurt their career is over and my injuries just kept happening and kept happening but im just happy to finally be healthy i feel fine i dont even think about my leg anymore
3133132 its really going to start with the back unit right now were going to work ramarcus brown and richard samuel caleb king and carlton thomas back deep
3133133 asher knows what hes doing and we need to take a look at those guys so we dont need to give asher a bunch of reps my main focus right now is really trying to find 10 guys at least two deep in that front unit that can athletically do what we need them to do to get those deep guys loose
3133134 right now until i can feel comfortable with someone else being able to field kicks ashers it because thats the first thing they go to do theyve got to be able to field the kicks and until i can feel comfortable with someone else back there doing it hes the guy
3133135 right now that no 2 that no 3 spot we need to know who that is and theyll both get an equal amount of reps and then well be able to assess what changes need to be made youve got five guys that really have to make a statement this afternoon
3133136 never in my wildest dreams did i think id be here today
3133137 my dad took me out in the yard and he said son im going to show you how to snap and maybe someday itll get you some playing time thats one of my most vivid memories from childhood and thats why im here today
3133138 but i wanted to be here my whole life if football didnt work out this was the college i wanted to be at anyway
3133139 he told me i needed to get back to athens as soon as possible
3133140 ty frix snaps it extremely well hes just not very big yet
3133141 he may still be able to hold up in there i dont know but he can snap it extremely well so that was a good thing to get him in camp
3133142 jeff henson is one of the most upstanding nicest guys youll ever meet
3133143 but every tragedys an opportunity i feel very really bad for jeff but this is an opportunity for me and its been a great experience
3133144 when i have kids i want them to be able to run fast and dont want them to have bangs
3133145 you know we have that in the u s all the time
3133146 apparently its a rarity here so i dont feel any less safe here than i do in new york city
3133147 i guess hearing that news doesnt make me feel that good
3133148 its very difficult for a lot of people to get visas
3133149 its difficult for a lot of people to get access to the beautiful olympic center if you dont have tickets you just want to visit the olympic park that has the downside of spoiling some of the beauty of the olympics for some people
3133150 i think theyre scared so theyre trying to use all the resources theyve got to make people safe
3133151 so we said we go dressed in orange so they know we are not americans
3133152 hey everybody can i get your attention please tonight we are riding for the benefit of lillian collier who was gravely injured in a bike accident from not wearing her helmet we are going to put on our helmets and turn on our blinkers and were going to obey the traffic laws on the way to glob that means keeping to the right observing all signs and yielding when appropriate be safe and have fun and love your bike
3133153 when we took a look at the options for releasing our new material we felt that a digital release was the right way for us to go
3133154 by making the release digital we were able to avoid the overhead of pressing cds which allows us to spend more money on production make the music free to fans and be more green friendly
3133155 as a band with a name like kosmos we felt like it was important to make a statement about the environment
3133156 releasing this album digitally and using green sources for the pr campaign are simply the right thing to do
3133157 we hope that people will spend the money on t shirts instead
3133158 most of our fans were getting our old cd and putting it on their computer or ipod to listen to anyway this just removes an unnecessary step
3133159 florida state studied the chicago bears rap the super bowl shuffle
3133160 while we were doing that miami was studying the 46 defense buddy ryans scheme that helped them win the super bowl they had never run it before they sprang it on us we had no answer we had very few answers
3133161 i was just trying to send the message that if you get too full of yourself it could come tumbling down in a hurry
3133162 i just told them that the preseason blessing could be a blessing or a curse it will be a curse if you choose to use it as a sense of entitlement like i dont have to work anymore it will be a blessing if it excites you to begin to work like you never worked
3133163 i have seen the ups and downs i have experience at both winning and losing
3133164 so people will have something to talk about other than what if
3133165 i just want to see an attitude that nobody is going to beat us
3133166 we have our own expectations we have our own goals
3133167 we are a family we are a close knit group of guys were in it for georgia for family we have so many good things we want to accomplish
3133168 i hear you dont want to talk to people who dont talk to you
3133169 and the lord god said it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a helper comparable to him
3133170 then the rib which the lord god had taken from man he made into a woman and he brought her to the man and adam said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and they shall become one flesh
3133171 houses and riches are an inheritance from fathers but a prudent wife is from the lord
3133172 he who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favour from the lord
3133173 the pharisees also came to him testing him and saying to him is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason
3133174 for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh
3133175 nevertheless neither is man independent of woman nor woman independent of man in the lord for as the woman was from the man even so the man also is through the woman but all things are from god
3133176 although we have not been officially married we have agreed between ourselves to be married so actually we are already married
3133177 let every soul be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and the authorities that exist are appointed by god therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of god and those who resist will bring judgement on themselves
3133178 marriage is honourable among all and the bed undefiled but fornicators and adulterers god will judge
3133179 let the husband render to his wife the affection due her and likewise also the wife to her husband the wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does and likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does do not deprive one another except with consent for a time that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again so that satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self control
3133180 wives submit to your own husbands as to the lord for the husband is head of the wife as also christ is head of the church and he is the saviour of the body therefore just as the church is subject to christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives just as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as the lord does the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself and let the wife see that she respects her husband
3133181 but its people who go to high profile schools great institutions that dont have the deep pockets that princeton has
3133182 its a dramatic difference from this year to last the bad news
3133183 the good news is that there are still some out there who feel that they can get to more borrowers than they could in a more competitive market
3133184 what is second life and how it can be used for educational purposes
3133185 thats why middle class teenagers in new delhi walk around in nirvana shirts without a thought about mystic oneness

3133191 picturing america is a unique program that provides students with a gateway to the entire universe of the humanities
3133192 by bringing great art into public and private schools libraries and communities like ours this program offers virgin islanders of all ages the opportunity to learn about american history in a fresh and engaging way
3133193 ive been telling the psc for months that this is coming that it was inevitable
3133194 if you cant pay your fuel bill it is only a matter of time before you get cut off
3133195 it was issued because of the delinquency of wapa and its payments
3133196 the public wants to jump at the authority to say wapa is doing this to me
3133197 nobody really considers the source and what we pay for it
3133198 bueno si no sabes y no estas segura pues escribe sobre la inmortalidad del cangrejo al cabo que ellos viven mucho tiempo hmmm
3133199 as part of registration students first meet with their academic advisers who may conduct walk in or online advising next they visit the registrars office for registration of their courses following which payments are made at the fiscal services department
3133200 as part of the entire process members of the colleges faculty and staff not only get an opportunity to welcome the new students to the institution but the students in turn are able to interact with their advisers other students and alumni
3133201 im happy to see another piece of the puzzle coming online
3133202 were going to try to get as much work as we figure is disruptive now while school is out
3133203 work where there is a lot of noise and demolition were going to do most of the work around this school this week and try to make it so when school starts were doing the more quiet work like laying rebar
3133204 it has no native predators and its a very voracious predator itself on our tropical reef fish
3133205 our fish are naive to this kind of predator they are not aware its a predator
3133206 the news is not good from anywhere in the world climate change global warming are damaging our reefs but we can try to eliminate local threats to our coral reefs
3133207 it was really great and im really glad i did it and its an experience you would never give up it really does change how you look at things
3133208 it made you really grateful about what you have seeing people happy with what little they have when you have so much more you should be really grateful and be as happy as they are
3133209 it was different cause ive never been on a plane that long we mostly slept and they played movies on the plane
3133210 it was really nice it was cold i thought it would be warm but it was cloudy
3133211 the children were really nice and happy to have somebody they would run up and hug you and try to teach you their language and stuff
3133212 she had short cut hair was very thin lanky and full of energy
3133213 she was very shy and happy to receive the gifts very loving
3133214 it was really graphic you see people crying and it helps you remember how real and how recent it was
3133215 if you just went walking around the city you wouldnt be able to tell but seeing it was just horrible
3133216 you cant escape what happened when you see the heart wrenching videos of survivors they are constantly finding bodies
3133217 overall in all our minds we look at these kids with tears in their eyes
3133218 they dont know what they dont have so they dont miss it
3133219 i learned how people live life there i learned more about the genocide there
3133220 most of the people are happy and pleasant and humble theyre trying to be peaceful its a peaceful country now
3133221 for people who had literally nothing they exuded so much warmth
3133222 it was a great day and i feel i was very successful
3133223 everyone was patting me on the back it went really well i think my amendments made it a better platform
3133224 we have a very strong nursing program here and many students came here for that not to mention the students we have in our national exchange program that will be with us for at least this semester
3133225 we are increasing in numbers every year and this seems to be the first year that we will be totally filled
3133226 im a computer science major so i am really excited to meet my teachers and see what they have to offer
3133227 we just want to move in the direction of accomplishing the many tasks getting our hands around a lot of the nitty gritty kinds of work
3133228 the last thing a community spends money on is the prison system
3133229 the ultimate goal is to not have as many people in prison as we do
3133230 were trying to comply with the consent decree as much as we can
3133231 we were having some challenges and we know we are being monitored by a special master
3133232 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3133233 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3133234 ma avr fatto la scelta giusta sar la scelta giusta x me la scelta sicura x la mia vita
3133235 ma io ho solo 16 anni oppure io ho sl 15 anni
3133236 io t amo e nn t lascio se tu vorrai andiamo avanti inx mano nella mano e affrontiamo questa cosa
3133237 we have apartments here everyone in beijing lives in an apartment
3133238 i expected a tough fight because these are the top guys in the world
3133239 its a really good experience for me learning all the time
3133240 i think i fought him better this time and to me it was a good fight i enjoyed it
3133241 i felt that i was in the fight the whole time
3133242 i think his head should have been moving a lot more getting under those wide hooks but i tell you what this guy that he fought is a very technical guy he definitely beat us but the score we ended up with should not have been there because we caught him some clean punches and square shots
3133243 and yet they did not give him the score there were punches that i saw him egan throw they were blocked but yet he got the score i was really disappointed in that sense but julius did a tremendous job being here says a lot about his accomplishments we now have to sit down and see what will happen after this
3133244 how can they come so close to the shore in these boats there are children here
3133245 we are nice people and we get rewarded like this i will close down everything i pay taxes this is my right
3133246 it was unbelievable to actually go out there hold the countrys flag and be representing the country
3133247 the experience was great i didnt see much but from what i saw from the lighting of the torch it was good
3133248 first you were waiting for things to get rolling but now the time is near and youre ready for business to have fun enjoy the experience and compete with the best athletes in the world
3133249 the rhythm has been going really well for the last two and a half weeks of practice training here has been better than for the entire year so im optimistic i feel really good my times werent good in the past but i have to work with a clean slate go out there have fun and do the things im capable of doing
3133250 we tried to see how we could have gone and compete with the current injury and it didnt work out as we had planned so we returned from europe went back to the drawing board and made some adjustments
3133251 over the last three weeks things have been going extremely well since weve been here we stepped it up and it has elevated to another level we have another week to continue training and preparations have been going well here in beijing
3133252 for months she couldnt run in spikes and she basically ran on three quarters of her foot after the world indoors we had huge expectations for opening up and i thought she could have run 52 seconds in the 400 meters outdoors
3133253 i was really excited about the way training was going and i really thought she would have run under 11 seconds this season based on training but those of us that know track and field well knows it takes just one injury and it brings you down to realistic levels sometimes

3133278 in his situation hes finally maturing at age 35 actually 34 sometimes its you sometimes its me t o thought for so long it was someone else but at some point maybe it dawns on you that its not everyone elses fault i think once bill parcells left t o realized that jerry jones truly loved him and now he has a quarterback that he feels comfortable with hes listening sometimes you have to understand the reality of the whole situation and i think he did that

3133281 oh i have it so bad and i just cant take it anymore 1 im gonna go gossip to everybody abou thow hard i have it and how many times i flew off the handle because im not going to take it anymore

3133283 the pattern of policymaking in the middle east as it was defined since us president george w
3133284 israel and the united states failed resoundingly in their attempt to dislodge hamas from gaza israel handed a strategic victory to hamas
3133285 israels 2006 war against hizbullah supported by the united states and the entire arab
3133286 the syrian patron of hizbullah president bashar assad another member of the axis of evil is also doing well
3133287 americas drive to force iran to stop its nuclear program through an ineffective sanctions regime has been no more successful than any of its other schemes to isolate the regions extremists indeed the us has now completely reversed its position of not negotiating with iran until it stops uranium enrichment
3133288 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3133289 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

3133291 which my good friend rob kolb gave me ive sort of come up with aw shucks this little idea of a training program if anyone wants to comment on it or give advice id sure appreciate it
3133292 whether its the music the newspapers or the wi fi if its a part of the experience youll go there
3133293 wi fi is really a customer centric practice for businesses
3133294 all you have to do is look at the growth of wi fi at companies like mcdonalds which keep adding wi fi
3133295 obviously if they felt it was detrimental they would have stopped
3133296 astrobiology has been a great program to work on and it and other experience at nasa has helped me to appreciate life in a cosmic context now i will try to reinvest some of that experience into research and policy work in an area that is essential to the quality of life for humans on earth
3133297 i am really interested in joining the astrobiology effort at this fascinating time in history when were learning so much about mars europa and even worlds like titan and enceladus as possible environments for life

3133300 i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch
3133301 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers
3133302 have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them
3133303 let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach

3133307 its almost unheard of summer doesnt usually afford films that much of a wide open playing field
3133308 it has taken on a life of its own and in doing so got so much positive press and word of mouth that older audiences who normally dont rush out to see movies or maybe only see two three movies a year are coming out in large numbers
3133309 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business

3133312 i know i treated you like crap but youre cyndi and so friendly and always eager to stay friends with people that im going to take you unadding me as an insult to my clearly fantastic personality and pretend to wonder how you are while all the while really trying to somehow get back in your life so we an start this completely assinine cycle all over again ps im probably single again which is why i suddenly have time to go through my facebook friends and for sure have time to email you pps you still in la

3133314 i got this guy crushed and can you believe he is rated nearly a hundred points over me my rating will go up from this tournament if you have time come look at the position
3133315 i had my opponent and i let my advantage slip i blundered a pawn and then overlooked a bishop and lost it for nothing but i should have won
3133316 look he had a queen on d5 and i was threatening it with my knight he moved it to h5 and i put my own queen in the diagonal ahead of my bishop of b7 well he blocked the mate with f3 and i took it with my pawn that was on g4 and he played his knight from e6 to g5 and i stupidly played my pawn to f2 attacking a rook his king was on h2 but it really looked like it was on h1 and then i realized i goofed and he proceeded to checkmate my king with qxh7
3133317 considering how many times this has happened i think that about five hundred dollars will suffice

3133343 kebangkitan gerakan mahasiswa islam sudah tiba masanya dan kita sendiri sudah tidak sabar untuk mempamerkan wajah kita yang sebenar menawan kampus bermakna kita menawan negara tarbiah yang kita terapkan selama ini sudah meraung raung untuk dilepaskan dalam bentuk yang lebih kental lalu jiwa jiwa dan hati hati kecil kita bagaikan soldadu yang sedia menerima arahan untuk bertindak ya kebangkitan ini diumpamakan tiupan angin lembut yang tiba tiba meruap ganas ditiup gunung gunung tercabut diterpa lautan lautan bergelora
3133344 kalau seorang muslim hendak membanggakan dirinya maka dia semestinya berbangga dengan pelbagai cubaan dan penderitaan yang dialami di jalan islam dia mesti bangga dengan jerih payah perjuangan dan kerja keras yang dia persembahkan untuk agama ini dan dia mesti bangga tatkala di berjuang dengan penuh pengorbanan untuk meninggikan kalimah la ilaha illallah

3133351 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
3133352 why cant grandma learn how to do this for herself
3133353 why dont you call so and so at this wonderful non profit alf i know about
3133354 oh im not too good at socializing oh im a very private person oh im not sure about eating all my meals in a cafeteria
3133355 from a woman who was a preachers wife for thirty some years hmm ill just wait and see
3133356 no thats not what i meant im not like that
3133357 do i ever get a chance to just stop and think about this for a few minutes
3133358 even when the rubrics say pause for a moment of reflection its a very skinny moment
3133359 to be back in a lutheran service your sisters church a hymn singing evangelical mega church was okay in its own way but i missed the lutheran liturgy it directs and focuses your thoughts so well
3133360 at least hes giving us the lutheran saved by grace version not the southern baptist repent or else version
3133361 let each person trust the little piece of grace she is ready to trust let each follow whatever worship form buys her enough time to make some sort of peace with me
3133362 let each person trust the little piece of grace she is ready to trust
3133363 this will be mikes fourth division i program so hes got some tremendous experience and a great resume for a young guy at this stage of his career
3133364 hes been a full time coach before so hes been on the recruiting trail and he will be able to help us out there he will bring a lot to our program and is a nice addition to our staff
3133365 we broke the huddle and the first guy i looked at was jamie silva bcs safety who was lined up right across from eddie
3133366 i knew silva would try to jump the ball hes a big ball hawk which is what makes him a great safety hes always trying to read my eyes
3133367 being the 2006 starter and having a decent year i got mvp of the spring and did well in august camp things looked good but they unraveled at lsu
3133368 the worst thing about it and what hurt the most was that it was a left hook out of nowhere i never saw it coming
3133369 i saw how much i missed by being on the sidelines and i didnt feel part of the celebrations after games when everyone was celebrating
3133370 i missed it i missed football you lose sight of it because youre under so much pressure we look at it as a business too much youve got to have fun
3133371 i took the attitude that if i ever got back out there i was going to enjoy it
3133372 my mom stopped coming to games after the ohio game
3133373 i was not in a good mood for a couple of weeks
3133374 i was out there throwing the ball around like wed throw it in the back yard
3133375 the pass to eddie in the acc championship game was the best moment of my athletic career because of all that happened during the season
3133376 as bad as last year was i wouldnt trade it playing my best football winning the acc title going to the orange bowl who knows if it happens if i dont get benched
3133377 life is going to be full of disappointments college football has been good for me as a person in that ive learned how to take criticism and learned how to take disappointments
3133378 i wouldnt be disappointed but id prefer to be the one guy
3133379 it probably makes the preparation for us more difficult to have two
3133380 they said were gonna blitz the crap out of tyrod and make him throw quick and when i was in the game theyd drop back in coverage they were going to make it tough to throw and for tyrod make it tough for him to have time to improvise kansas brought the house every play he was a true freshman
3133381 this is my last year there is pressure in that but 99 percent of kids would trade positions with me in a heartbeat im going out and enjoying it have fun while you can

3133393 ive talked to my mum quite a bit and the phones ringing and theres a lot of media interest and of course its just my mum in christchurch shes not equipped to deal with something of this magnitude not that shes not capable its just that its so surreal that all of a sudden she gets drawn into this he said
3133394 we have a small family in new zealand but were tight i know shes hurting and shes very much a part of the broader picture
3133395 our two families were very close and it is a good in law relationship shes rocked its hard for all of us
3133396 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me he said
3133397 i am passionate about the game my job i enjoy coaching volleyball has been wonderful to elisabeth and i but at this stage its very easy for me to focus on the task at hand which is taking care of my immediate family
3133398 once weve got it taken care of we can look at other things in life but right now thats purely where my focus is
3133399 the one thing that has been incredible has been the huge groundswell of support to help us pick up the pieces and help us manage this difficult situation as best as we can he said
3133400 interest has been global but in no way have we exposed ourselves with dealing with our emails and our phonecalls or anything like that its just too overwhelming we appreciate that everyone is with us we are just in no capacity to deal with that right now
3133401 stood for all the right things and he lived them
3133402 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence there is no indication her that there was an pre meditation it seems unfortunately to be a case of the wrong place at the wrong time certainly in our opinion that is the way it seems to be he said
3133403 it hurts its its something that no one should have to got through lifes not fair so its never going to be about that kind of stuff
3133404 at the end of the day it happened and it seems the the sooner we can come to grips with that and kind of process it the better off were going to be anger isnt an emotion im going to allow myself to indulge in
3133405 acted out of despair over personal failures the official xinhua news agency quoted police as saying
3133406 certainly the team has been influenced by this its not exactly how you would want to prepare for your first match having to deal with a tragedy of this nature
3133407 you will no longer receive our special offers however you will continue to receive any newsletters to which you have subscribed
3133408 we will need more goals more assists and more production from him
3133409 from a performance standpoint he was very good he has to shoulder a lot of that burden if he can get us 10 15 goals this year its going to be right around what were looking for from him he knows that he has worked very hard this offseason i think paul is an important person for us to have and to have scoring goals this year
3133410 i think those four guys are important because they have all played and contributed significantly we have some good young prospects but at the end of the day you need your experience in tight games to win and certainly those four guys will help
3133411 he is most likely going to be one of the fastest if not the fastest player in the big east this year
3133412 the kid is a winner i think whenever you get a kid with that kind of pace you cant coach that i think that is going to be his biggest asset at this level
3133413 mike is a big target center forward who a lot of people dont know about but hes going to play some minutes for us
3133414 hes going to be a very powerful center forward that can go by people and he shoots the ball very well
3133415 i didnt blow anything so i can go home happy unfortunately its a partnership you both have to be on the top of your game i wasnt on top of my game but tom was nowhere near the top of his

3133420 one of the great regrets i have about whats happened so far in my second term and happened in many ways in the first term is that when you have members of your own party and two of us get along very well and we dont agree on everything and the third for whatever reason doesnt want to talk to us its a very difficult way to govern
3133421 and again i urge you if you know speaker madigan and talk to him tell him i said hello ill cut his apple get him a cup of coffee come to the table work with us and be part of this process
3133422 over the past several years to deal with the issues that hes been so right on the issues as it relates to adequate funding of early childhood education the issue that hes been out front on to see to it that more illinoisans who do not have health care insurance get health care insurance
3133423 who says democrats in high places in springfield dont get along
3133424 in fact this is such a job you know that i think its fair to say that today i have fewer friends now than i had before i was governor but its nice to know ive still got emil
3133425 that is a compliment emil and i are homeboys man there are times i consider myself the first african american governor of illinois so i dont mind that at all

3133432 always ready to claim what it hasnt got and mistake its ounce of brass filings for a ton of gold dust you have a mongrel perception of humor nothing more a multitude of you possess that this multitude see the comic side of a thousand low grade and trivial things broad incongruities mainly grotesqueries absurdities evokers of the horse laugh the ten thousand high grade comicalities which exist in the world are sealed from their dull vision will a day come when the race will detect the funniness of these juvenilities and laugh at them and by laughing at them destroy them for your race in its poverty has unquestionably one really effective weapon laughter power money persuasion supplication persecution these can lift at a colossal humbug push it a little weaken it a little century by century but only laughter can blow it to rags and atoms at a blast against the assault of laughter nothing can stand you are always fussing and fighting with your other weapons do you ever use that one no you leave it lying rusting as a race do you ever use it at all no you lack sense and the courage
3133433 why do you cover the pot cant you grow the tree in the sunlight
3133434 you are only an apprentice you dont know your trade give me the seed i will show you
3133435 it is a cherry seed of course you will raise a cherry
3133436 oh no that is a trifle any novice can do that shall i raise an orange tree from it
3133437 away from here clear out you dogs the tree is on my lands and is my property
3133438 please let them have their pleasure for an hour sir only that and no longer afterward you may forbid them and you will still have more fruit than you and the state together can consume in a year
3133439 who are you you vagabond to tell your betters what they may do and what they maynt
3133440 take good care of the tree for its health and yours are bound together it will never bear again but if you tend it well it will live long water its roots once in each hour every night and do it yourself it must not be done by proxy and to do it in daylight will not answer if you fail only once in any night the tree will die and you likewise do not go home to your own country any more you would not reach there make no business or pleasure engagements which require you to go outside your gate at night you cannot afford the risk do not rent or sell this place it would be injudicious
3133441 i would have done it but for his wife who has not offended me she is coming to him presently from their native land portugal she is well but has not long to live and has been yearning to see him and persuade him to go back with her next year she will die without knowing he cant leave that place
3133442 he he will not trust that secret with any one he will reflect that it could be revealed in sleep in the hearing of some portuguese guests servant some time or other
3133443 did none of those natives understand what you said to him
3133444 none of them understood but he will always be afraid that some of them did that fear will be torture to him for he has been a harsh master to them in his dreams he will imagine them chopping his tree down that will make his days uncomfortable i have already arranged for his nights
3133445 he thought he didnt but our vanishing helped the tree where there had been no tree before that helped the insane and uncanny variety of fruits the sudden withering all these things are helps let him think as he may reason as he may one thing is certain he will water the tree but between this and night he will begin his changed career with a very natural precaution for him
3133446 he will fetch a priest to cast out the trees devil you are such a humorous race and dont suspect it
3133447 no he will say a juggler from bombay created it and that he wants the jugglers devil driven out of it so that it will thrive and be fruitful again the priests incantations will fail then the portuguese will give up that scheme and get his watering pot ready
3133448 but the priest will burn the tree i know it he will not allow it to remain
3133449 yes and anywhere in europe he would burn the man too but in india the people are civilized and these things will not happen the man will drive the priest away and take care of the tree
3133450 satan you have given him a hard life i think
3133451 and you are going away and will not come back any more
3133452 we have comraded long together and it has been pleasant pleasant for both but i must go now and we shall not see each other any more
3133453 in this life satan but in another we shall meet in another surely
3133454 but but we have seen that future life seen it in its actuality and so
3133455 nothing exists all is a dream god man the world the sun the moon the wilderness of stars a dream all a dream they have no existence nothing exists save empty space and you
3133456 and you are not you you have no body no blood no bones you are but a thought
3133457 i am perishing already i am failing i am passing away
3133458 strange that you should not have suspected years ago centuries ages eons ago for you have existed companionless through all the eternities
3133459 you perceive now that these things are all impossible except in a dream
3133460 it is true that which i have revealed to you there is no god no universe no human race no earthly life no heaven no hell it is all a dream a grotesque and foolish dream nothing exists but you and you are but a thought a vagrant thought a useless thought a homeless thought wandering forlorn among the empty eternities
3133461 always ready to claim what it hasnt got and mistake its ounce of brass filings for a ton of gold dust you have a mongrel perception of humor nothing more a multitude of you possess that this multitude see the comic side of a thousand low grade and trivial things broad incongruities mainly grotesqueries absurdities evokers of the horse laugh the ten thousand high grade comicalities which exist in the world are sealed from their dull vision will a day come when the race will detect the funniness of these juvenilities and laugh at them and by laughing at them destroy them for your race in its poverty has unquestionably one really effective weapon laughter power money persuasion supplication persecution these can lift at a colossal humbug push it a little weaken it a little century by century but only laughter can blow it to rags and atoms at a blast against the assault of laughter nothing can stand you are always fussing and fighting with your other weapons do you ever use that one no you leave it lying rusting as a race do you ever use it at all no you lack sense and the courage
3133462 why do you cover the pot cant you grow the tree in the sunlight
3133463 you are only an apprentice you dont know your trade give me the seed i will show you
3133464 it is a cherry seed of course you will raise a cherry
3133465 oh no that is a trifle any novice can do that shall i raise an orange tree from it
3133466 and shall i make it bear other fruits as well as oranges
3133467 away from here clear out you dogs the tree is on my lands and is my property
3133468 please let them have their pleasure for an hour sir only that and no longer afterward you may forbid them and you will still have more fruit than you and the state together can consume in a year
3133469 who are you you vagabond to tell your betters what they may do and what they maynt
3133470 take good care of the tree for its health and yours are bound together it will never bear again but if you tend it well it will live long water its roots once in each hour every night and do it yourself it must not be done by proxy and to do it in daylight will not answer if you fail only once in any night the tree will die and you likewise do not go home to your own country any more you would not reach there make no business or pleasure engagements which require you to go outside your gate at night you cannot afford the risk do not rent or sell this place it would be injudicious
3133471 i would have done it but for his wife who has not offended me she is coming to him presently from their native land portugal she is well but has not long to live and has been yearning to see him and persuade him to go back with her next year she will die without knowing he cant leave that place
3133472 he he will not trust that secret with any one he will reflect that it could be revealed in sleep in the hearing of some portuguese guests servant some time or other
3133473 did none of those natives understand what you said to him
3133474 none of them understood but he will always be afraid that some of them did that fear will be torture to him for he has been a harsh master to them in his dreams he will imagine them chopping his tree down that will make his days uncomfortable i have already arranged for his nights
3133475 he thought he didnt but our vanishing helped the tree where there had been no tree before that helped the insane and uncanny variety of fruits the sudden withering all these things are helps let him think as he may reason as he may one thing is certain he will water the tree but between this and night he will begin his changed career with a very natural precaution for him
3133476 he will fetch a priest to cast out the trees devil you are such a humorous race and dont suspect it
3133477 no he will say a juggler from bombay created it and that he wants the jugglers devil driven out of it so that it will thrive and be fruitful again the priests incantations will fail then the portuguese will give up that scheme and get his watering pot ready
3133478 but the priest will burn the tree i know it he will not allow it to remain
3133479 yes and anywhere in europe he would burn the man too but in india the people are civilized and these things will not happen the man will drive the priest away and take care of the tree
3133480 satan you have given him a hard life i think
3133481 and you are going away and will not come back any more
3133482 we have comraded long together and it has been pleasant pleasant for both but i must go now and we shall not see each other any more
3133483 in this life satan but in another we shall meet in another surely
3133484 but but we have seen that future life seen it in its actuality and so
3133485 nothing exists all is a dream god man the world the sun the moon the wilderness of stars a dream all a dream they have no existence nothing exists save empty space and you
3133486 and you are not you you have no body no blood no bones you are but a thought
3133487 i am perishing already i am failing i am passing away
3133488 you perceive now that these things are all impossible except in a dream
3133489 it is true that which i have revealed to you there is no god no universe no human race no earthly life no heaven no hell it is all a dream a grotesque and foolish dream nothing exists but you and you are but a thought a vagrant thought a useless thought a homeless thought wandering forlorn among the empty eternities

3133727 i know where my next meal is coming from but there are kids who could be living in this neighborhood who may not know where their next meal is coming from
3133728 only 6 percent are actually homeless that means people you talk to every day are benefiting from harvesters you keep that in mind and you definitely want to help out
3133729 forty three percent of people who benefit from harvesters are kids so we did a back to school theme every kid deserves to go back to school with a full stomach
3133730 this is a great opportunity for high schoolers to get involved
3133731 so they commit to a year long term where they fulfill 25 hours of service for harvesters
3133732 during the year kids can benefit from the reduced price meals at school but over the summer they arent really sure where their next meal is coming from
3133733 a lot of kids have suffered over the summer and this is a way to get them back into the school year with a full stomach

3133737 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3133738 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3133739 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3133740 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3133741 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3133742 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3133743 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3133744 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3133745 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3133746 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3133747 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3133748 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3133749 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3133750 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3133751 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3133752 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3133763 a ju za perguntou por que ele estava se casando novamente comigo e ele respondeu que n o sabia que me amava tanto
3133764 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3133775 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3133776 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3133777 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3133778 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3133779 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3133780 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3133781 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3133782 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3133783 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3133784 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3133785 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3133786 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3133787 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3133788 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3133789 who are open to doing something on the production side
3133790 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3133791 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3133792 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3133793 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3133794 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3133795 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3133796 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3133800 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3133801 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3133802 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3133803 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

3133808 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3133809 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3133810 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3133811 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3133812 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3133813 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3133814 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3133815 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3133816 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3133817 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3133818 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3133819 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3133820 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3133821 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3133822 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3133823 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3133824 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3133825 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3133826 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3133827 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3133832 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3133833 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3133834 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3133835 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3133836 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3133837 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3133838 n o estaremos na verdade lan ando um manto sobre coisa alguma
3133839 n o creio que as pessoas precisem se preocupar com a possibilidade de que algu m saia caminhando invis vel ao menos em curto prazo para ser honesto estamos no come o da estrada que permitiria realizar algo assim
3133840 nos materiais que ocorrem na natureza o ndice de refra o uma medida de como a luz se dobra em determinado meio sempre positivo
3133841 quando voc v um peixe na gua ele parece estar frente de sua posi o real
3133842 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3133843 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3133844 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3133845 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3133846 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3133847 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3133848 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3133849 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3133850 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3133851 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3133852 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3133853 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3133854 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3133855 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3133860 2008 has been a phenomenal year for vistaar as our client base continues to grow at an unprecedented rate some of the largest companies in the world have selected vistaars technology to drive their pricing initiatives
3133861 we are very pleased to have bill and ed join our team the addition of world class talent and pricing expertise further demonstrates our on going commitment to deliver superior service and unrivaled value to our customers
3133862 what differentiates the vistaar solution from its peers is its unique combination of analytical horsepower flexibility to model complex pricing environments and the ability to represent all of this through an interface that is very natural and intuitive for business users to work with
3133863 technology can add incredible value to the pricing process but only if it works in harmony with underlying business processes and is adopted consistently across the organization
3133864 what attracted me to vistaar is their understanding of the interdependence between business process and technology and their demonstrated ability to offer practical solutions that deliver measurable results to clients
3133865 obviously his strategists met on the portico of the mccain estate in sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses and decided what line of attack they were going to use
3133866 mccain doesnt care about how americans care about this presidential election americans are excited to have actual change in senator obama not more of the same in mccain mccain doesnt want you to care about this country or the fact he sends american jobs overseas by making fun of your concerns voice of american voter im tired of john mccain making fun of my concern for this country and that i care about the need for change its time to turn the tired old page and vote for senator obama as our president who can move this country forward not backwards
3133867 cellcom isreal is the dominant cell phone provider in a country where more people use cell phones than almost anywhere else on earth
3133868 israelis use them at home instead of traditional fixed line phones every 12 year old kid has a cell phone glued to their ear but the market still has room to grow the nations population is growing at almost 2 a year thanks to a continuous influx of new immigrants
3133869 the economy has grown over 5 a year for the past four years and a healthy economy means more people with more money to spend on wireless services and spend they do telecom services accounts for over 4 of the nations economy
3133870 only three major operators are competing in this hot market each claims a large percentage of the countrys wireless market but the one with the biggest piece of the pie is cellcom israel with over three million customers it controls over 34 of the wireless market
3133871 since new management took the reins in late 2005 the company has upgraded its network and launched a variety of cutting edge products and services
3133872 cellcoms ultra fast 3g wireless network allows customers to use their phones for more than just voice communication subscribers can now text message download music or video conference revenue from these new data applications climbed over 45 last year
3133873 the companys dividend policy is to distribute at least 75 of annual net income to shareholders in quarterly installments besides the regular dividend management also seeks to distribute at least 50 of earnings each year
3133874 over the past year the company paid out 3 93 per share including regular quarterly dividends of 2 43 and a special payout of 1 50 that gives the stock a yield of 11 8 of the recent share price
3133875 according to israeli tax law the company must deduct at ource 20 of the dividend amount payable to u s shareholders
3133876 however u s investors can claim a foreign tax credit for this amount against their federal income tax the dividend should qualify for the 15 reduced dividend tax rate making the stock suitable for a taxable account theres no dividend reinvestment plan
3133877 israel is hardly a safe haven geopolitically but it does offer shelter from the financial tsunami on wall street moreover company operations have remained unaffected by tensions in the middle east
3133878 earnings are forecast to grow over 20 this year and average 9 10 growth over the next few years largely due to the companys data service business
3133879 cellcoms shares have enjoyed total returns of more than 40 over the past year in a down market but are still attractively priced
3133880 i mean theyre booing all of us so yeah i take it personally
3133881 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
3133882 theres some things that the production wasnt there whether it was on the front end or the back end of the pass play
3133883 its kind of a personal matter and im going to keep that personal rodgers said
3133884 if he can go i would like to see him go mccarthy said

3133890 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3133891 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3133892 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3133893 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3133894 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3133895 i think as sports fans youre always going to feel sorry for the guy who finishes second thats human nature
3133896 but as a fellow golfer a fellow professional i feel sorry for garcia theres enormous pressure on his shoulders
3133897 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way
3133898 that doesnt mean that im not on the right track so im looking forward to the challenges im just going to keep giving it my best and its just a matter of time
3133899 i was happy to see that at least this time it stayed on the green

3133918 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3133919 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger he said after his two shot victory over sergio garcia and ben curtis
3133920 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course
3133921 its a long way to catch tiger at the top harrington said
3133922 but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me controlling what i can do thats the only thing i can ask of myself
3133923 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem harrington said
3133924 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
3133925 i dodged a bullet because there was some more high profile losers that day he said referring to mickelson and colin montgomerie
3133926 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major and youve got to lose them to know you can win them ive got to put myself in the position and learn from it and understand it before i actually go and do it

3133957 battle of the sexes match at the houston astrodome on sept 20 1973
3133958 male chauvinist pig threatened to jump off a california bridge if he lost to the 29 year old king a television audience of 48 million tuned in to see what would happen
3133959 pressure is a privilege lessons ive learned from life and the battle of the sexes remembers the pivotal match ahead of its 35th anniversary combining those memories with the wisdom the tennis legend gained from her blue collar parents while growing up in long beach calif
3133960 that match taught me a lot dealing with the media and the attention and pressure and what it stood for the symbolism of the womens movement king told the associated press in a recent interview
3133961 its a fun read it will take you an hour and half its quick king said
3133962 besides chapters on pressure is a privilege and champions adjust i talk about integrity and my heroes that were important in my childhood like my teachers rev bob richards and alice marble

3133965 vietnam was just cooling down watergate was heating up we had roe vs
3133966 we didnt even have fax machines yet or microwaves or cable television so you can imagine how much focus was on us
3133967 it was tongue in cheek women got in an uproar you know why because its the oldest battle man vs woman and it happens in homes every day
3133968 if anybody knew bobby riggs he didnt want to lose a bet
3133969 so many people came up it was as if mick jagger was on the stage brennan said

3133973 i watched the show and i liked him a lot
3133974 now i know what to do if i ever get in a situation where i need to survive
3133975 we want to show how students can work together as a team to accomplish a goal and also how they can sort out their differences
3133976 i like how he took a chance and never gave up
3133977 i was known as the nice guy on the show and the ice cream scooper from hell
3133978 i ate a lot of coconuts but no bugs and i lasted 36 out of 39 days
3133979 i was the last guy standing but got voted out after getting tricked into giving immunity to one of the four girls left
3133980 to see what he went through it makes it easier for what we do in games like capture the flag and scatterball
3133981 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3133982 i watched the show and i liked him a lot

3133985 to see what he went through it makes it easier for what we do in games like capture the flag and scatterball
3133986 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3133987 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3133988 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3133989 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3133990 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3133991 i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on
3133992 the one guys loyalty and passion over there i dont question is his i think we have eliminated any and all excuses now no one can point any fingers
3133993 we respect cobi hes stepping in and filling a void whether or not cobis comfortable being the head coach or whether or not he has the experience well play that one by ear cobi certainly will have a voice in this
3133994 that said well see where we go with the head coaching position
3133995 i dont think were going to mandate or dictate that
3133996 we certainly could make a quick decision if thats whats necessary my guess is a lot of people will want to throw their name in the ring here
3133997 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start
3133998 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start
3133999 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3134268 over the nine years that obamas law license was active in illinois he never handled a trial and mostly worked in teams of lawyers who drew up briefs and contracts in a variety of cases
3134269 shows he played the strong silent type in court introducing himself and his client then stepping aside to let other lawyers do the talking
3134270 a search of all the cases in cook county circuit court in which obama made an appearance since he graduated from harvard in 1991 shows zero

3134299 in the past few decades the process for starting churches has been predictable it begins with an organization network or denomination identifying a community that needs a church next they find a church planter he starts a church and as it gets bigger ideally the church starts engaging the community down the line they will help plant another church in this model the church comes before society
3134300 in contrast heres the acts 11 model of how churches were started we start with the gospel pure and simple it finds its way to a disciple the disciple begins to change from the inside out he or she lives it and engages people whenever they are in society from there the church emerges the church is evangelistic and it doesnt have a program evangelism is what this church is not something it tries to promote and do in this model engaging the society comes first then comes the church

3134323 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
3134324 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
3134325 interestingly apparently there isnt much paperwork on obamas parents marriage
3134326 if only one parent was a u s citizen at the time of your birth that parent must have resided in the united states for at least 10 years at least five of which had to be after the age of 16

3134338 breast feeding is associated with resilience against the psychosocial stress linked with parental divorce separation
3134339 theres a lot less verbal communication but lots of tactile communication and eye contact that promotes positive physiological responses
3134340 breast feeding does seem to suppress stress responses in babies and it does seem that theres a protective effect
3134341 in terms of the biological possibility breast milk is pretty amazing stuff and the tactile interaction that goes along with breast feeding does have an influence on the development of neurons
3134342 for most mothers breast feeding doesnt come naturally if the baby doesnt latch on it can lead to feelings of failure and concern about whether or not the baby is getting enough milk women need lots of encouragement and education

3134375 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame

3134378 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3134379 i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on
3134380 the one guys loyalty and passion over there i dont question is his i think we have eliminated any and all excuses now no one can point any fingers
3134381 we respect cobi hes stepping in and filling a void whether or not cobis comfortable being the head coach or whether or not he has the experience well play that one by ear cobi certainly will have a voice in this
3134382 that said well see where we go with the head coaching position
3134383 i dont think were going to mandate or dictate that
3134384 we certainly could make a quick decision if thats whats necessary my guess is a lot of people will want to throw their name in the ring here
3134385 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start
3134386 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start

3134412 one of the many strengths of the british academy video games awards is that the focus is on creativity and innovation as opposed to a simple measure of commercial success this enables niche but highly creative work to be recognised and rewarded

3134422 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3134423 its nice to be known for something good like that
3134424 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3134425 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3134426 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality hes that type of guy thats going to put his head down and barrel on
3134427 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning
3134428 if ever there was a golf course you could discount a poor round this would be the one
3134429 would i have liked both of them to have played better of course theres three weeks to go i like both of them a lot so i dont think you can say that rocco choked yesterday and i really dont think j b has any choke in him
3134430 i really liked the leadership and demeanor billy showed in the spring but he didnt take anything for granted at that point
3134431 he really took charge over the summer during our conditioning program and the players workouts that was where he earned the respect and confidence of his teammates
3134432 at approximately 2 30 this morning police were called to a report of a disturbance outside bamboo nightclub
3134433 a 23 year old male was the victim of a minor assault as a result two men aged 18 and 19 were arrested and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal
3134434 a 21 year old man was also arrested for a breach of the peace he was issued with a fixed penalty notice and later released
3134435 he didnt go to many camps this summer because we wanted him to go to summer school he did well and helped him out a lot if bernard does well this year in school and gets a qualifying sat he should be good to go
3134436 bernard is very good in space and has great instincts and closing speed
3134437 in his first two games he picked off four passes and returned one for a touchdown
3134438 after the first two games our opposition stopped throwing to the middle of the field
3134439 i can only remember one other pass thrown down the middle
3134440 all i know is that in the past when anythings been taken away from erasmus hes always come back with a vengeance
3134441 and thats the plan he needs to come back with a vengeance wanting to establish himself as a good football player in this league
3134442 its always been a first round draft pick and trying to overcome injuries
3134443 its been pretty hard but i enjoy the patience the redskins have had and i feel like im ready to go out there and actually show what first round is
3134444 weve seen in the training room and the weight room that desire to get back healthy
3134445 he has definitely overachieved there were very hopeful thats going to carry over
3134446 it adds another very good football player into the mix
3134447 i dont want to judge erasmus too quickly weve got some other guys who have been pushing for some playing time as well so its nice to have that problem
3134448 i have never missed practice it is frustrating it was awkward for me very awkward the only thing i can do is try to go back
3134449 the referee made me come out because i was bleeding
3134450 everybody in this sport takes care of themselves gets massages eats right does all those things a lot of times with pro linemen injuries happen when you are in the wrong place at the wrong time fortunately for me that hasnt happened and i am not going to think about that now
3134451 i was sitting there watching the plays and trying to think through what i do out there think through the footwork
3134452 if you can see little things that can help the other guy out thats part of being a teammate and part of being in our group
3134453 i definitely feel more comfortable than at this time last year
3134454 i have all of last year under my belt you have to go out there and earn it i have taken each week and each day of training camp to improve as a player and get better
3134455 injuries are a part of this thing and you deal with it
3134456 the young uns have to step up and play weve said that already and now they just have to do it for a while
3134457 i went to the temple one day camp and i think that was in june

3134460 i went on a vacation down south and visited some campuses like virginia and clemson
3134461 virginia clemson and boston college are going to be in my top five
3134462 i like virginia because they have really good academics clemsons location is very nice and that would be a good atmosphere to play in boston college is just a couple of minutes away from boston you could go to a celtics game or watch the red sox play there would always be something to do

3134467 c ollateral source benefits may relate to the plaintiffs need to recover damages from the wrongdoer but they have no bearing on the plaintiffs right to recover such damages
3134468 it is improper to reduce a plaintiffs damages by payments for medical treatment under a health insurance policy if the premiums were paid by the plaintiff or a third party other than the tortfeasor
3134469 c ollateral source benefits may relate to the plaintiffs need to recover damages from the wrongdoer but they have no bearing on the plaintiffs right to recover such damages
3134470 there is a sharp distinction between collateral source benefits and payments by another person also charged with liability for the injury which is the subject matter of the lawsuit
3134471 the logic behind the collateral source rule is that there is no reason why a wrongdoer should receive the benefit of insurance obtained by the injured party for his own protection
3134472 t he object of compensatory damages is to make the injured party whole to the extent that it is possible to measure his injury in terms of money the object is not to place the plaintiff in a better position than he would have been had the wrong not been done
3134473 the purpose of compensatory tort damages is to compensate it is not the purpose of such damages to punish defendants or bestow a windfall upon plaintiffs
3134474 reasonable value is a term of limitation not of aggrandizement a plaintiff is entitled to recover
3134475 r ecovery for medical expenses is limited to the amount of medical expenses that he actually was obligated to pay
3134476 t he collateral source rule is not applicable under these circumstances a medical provider by agreement and contract may not charge medicaid patients for the difference between their sic customary charge and the amount paid by medicaid
3134477 w here as here the exact amount of expenses has been established by contract and those expenses have been satisfied there is no longer any issue as to the amount of expenses for which the plaintiff will be liable

3134486 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
3134487 our findings of decreased disability in addition to prolonged survival among middle aged and older adults participating in routine physical activities further support recommendations to encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity at all ages
3134488 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place

3134496 in cities and towns throughout the country neighborhoods have been plagued by gang assaults robberies and shootings often associated with narcotics trafficking
3134497 these crimes can be committed for money for revenge or to control gang turf
3134498 we recognize that the solution to gangs is both a vigorous law enforcement effort and also an effort that allows us to address the issue of prevention discouraging people to join gangs in the first place and dealing with prisoner re entry

3134505 so to lay a whole new level of change and even more uncertainty for the business i think would be a real challenge for telecom and could in fact increase costs with perhaps some rather uncertain benefits
3134506 that cant intrinsically be good value for long term holders of a telecommunications stock
3134507 there is not a wider concerted offer behind what we have put together today so far
3134508 without a full scale shareholder revolt it appears an uphill battle to turn around the company
3134509 telecom has carefully considered the implications of structural separation and does not believe that separating our retail and network businesses would be in the best interest of shareholders at this time

3134529 we really dont know as much about obesity as we think we do
3134530 a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3134531 our study shows you can still be healthy even if you are obese
3134532 altogether 10 percent of the study population and 25 percent of the obese subjects had a high insulin sensitivity phenotype or metabolically benign obesity
3134533 our data suggest that ectopic fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3134534 thats an area that we are very intrigued with as well
3134535 if you start stuffing people with calories it is very much like making pate from goose liver
3134536 the fact that all the deaths went up but we could not find the specific cause may be because vitamin d plays a role in both cancer and heart disease and potentially other things
3134537 i think vitamin d is like everything else in the body there has to be a ideal level
3134538 its not 100 percent but the correlation was very good

3134554 if both browny and the club were exactly on the same page he would have signed by now
3134555 were confident that browny will play for the lions next year but he certainly i think has been doing due diligence on what his options are
3134556 ive always been a believer in you give your home club first crack at it and if they satisfy your needs you dont really need to go any further you dont want it to turn into a dutch auction
3134557 if you want to reach a state of bliss then go beyond your ego and the internal dialogue make a decision to relinquish the need to control the need to be approved and the need to judge those are the three things the ego is doing all the time its very important to be aware of them every time they come up

3134559 people think a soul mate is your perfect fit and thats what everyone wants but a true soul mate is a mirror the person who shows you everything that is holding you back the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life a true soul mate is probably the most important person youll ever meet because they tear down your walls and smack you awake but to live with a soul mate forever nah too painful soul mates they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you and then leave a soul mates purpose is to shake you up tear apart your ego a little bit show you your obstacles and addictions break your heart open so new light can get in make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life then introduce you to your spiritual master
3134560 begley tries to steer the reader into believing the wildly speculative multiverse hypothesis a pet philosophical favorite of materialists while barely even hinting that the alternative and much more elegant explanation is intelligent design of the cosmos for those who are informed on this subject her article comes off as if she is trying to hide the design inference from the reader as a reasonable conclusion to explain the incredible fine tuning of the universe

3134565 what we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that zune could provide that itunes or any competing service couldnt
3134566 the thing weve all been looking for is what can we do that is a little more interesting than just looking at a piece of video
3134567 i cant say i understand the rules of the media and im not sure they do either
3134568 it will come as a surprise to many people that there are rules in politics most of those rules are unwritten and are based on common understandings acceptable practices and the best interest of the political party a candidate seeks to lead one of those rules is this do not provide ammunition to the opposition party that can be used to destroy your partys nominee this is a hyper truth where the presidential contest is concerned
3134569 would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee

3134576 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3134577 hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3134578 i can confirm that alcohol was involved in the incident

3134594 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3134595 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3134596 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3134597 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3134598 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3134599 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3134600 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3134601 the addition of peter fits perfectly with our strategy to build on the success we have enjoyed and to realize our full potential so the business will continue to grow now and beyond my lifetime
3134602 our main goal with this new site is to use its original content to help us climb back to the top in search engine ranking
3134603 there are so many funny pictures and videos related to sextoys out on the internet
3134604 we thought this would be a good place to aggregate all that content
3134605 we have gone from the top of the search engines to the bottom back to the top and down again
3134606 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3134607 were allowed to text out of school like on school grounds outside in the parking lot
3134608 its really best to tell kids when you are texting you know devote your attention to texting go to a safe place and do it rather than trying to operate a vehicle or a bike or walking

3134610 he does not see me do those kinds of things
3134611 among teens and young adults in particular who are arriving in emergency departments with serious and sometimes fatal injuries because they were not paying attention while texting
3134612 we see this every day since we are in downtown chicago with lots of people walking around
3134613 people are texting and they trip and fall on their faces usually people in their 20s we see a lot of face chin mouth and eye injuries from falls
3134614 some people are actually on chicagos busy lakefront path texting while walking or exercising
3134615 we see people rollerblading or biking while texting they are usually very skilled but sometimes crash and fall when they are not watching where they are going
3134616 in march we were driving and saw a woman in her twenties step off the curb and get struck square by a pickup truck
3134617 she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury you could tell she saw the truck at the last moment because her cell phone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet it was horrifying the truck stopped the driver was devastated i was amazed to hear she survived all the way to trauma center but died in the er
3134618 he was distracted and was killed as he crossed the road
3134619 in ireland the government developed advertising specifically targeted at teens for this very reason
3134620 the bottom line is to be aware of potential safety concerns and to simply exercise caution restraint and good judgment at all times when using a cell phone or blackberry
3134621 as we entered the turnstile i looked up towards one of the staircases and saw a man sitting on the stairs receiving oral sex from a woman whom i recognized from the local womens shelter

3134623 the u s market looks like it could produce a year where equipment sales come in down 7 percent to 8 percent which may not sound that bad until you judge it against 10 years of equipment sales that were plus or minus 2 percent regardless of what the economy was doing

3134644 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3134645 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3134646 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality hes that type of guy thats going to put his head down and barrel on

3134731 un razboi prelungit ar fi dezastruos pentru ca guvernul a avut succes in transformarea unei destinatii neatractive pentru investitori intr una atractiva iar o inversare a situatiei va fi un pas inapoi serios
3134732 conflictul inghetat din osetia de sud a fost intotdeauna un motiv de ingrijorare pentru investitorii straini in georgia si daca dupa acest conflict problema se va rezolva georgia ar putea deveni o destinatie mai atractiva
3134733 deocamdata soselele sunt operationale si se poate circula pe drumuri desi pot aparea intarzieri din cauza unor probleme de securitate la granite si a unor tancuri de pe drum care pot crea astfel de probleme

3134758 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3134759 consideram ca vanzarile pe astfel de categorii sunt firesti pe o piata in crestere in care tendintele influenteaza comportamentul de cumparare cateva exemple ar fi preferinta pentru produsele ce ofera mobilitate precum notebook urile dispozitivele gps trecerea de la crt la lcd si de la formatul clasic la cel wide 16 9 in cazul monitoarelor tendinta vizibila de inlocuire a modelelor vechi de camere digitale cu aparate noi care au functii si tehnologii inovatoare design atractiv mai multi megapixeli

3134770 when it comes to video games parents should know that what they play is a resource that helps demystify one of the most popular and challenging forms of entertainment their kids are into
3134771 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3134772 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk

3134833 we are not going to green light a plan where all we are doing is taking business that somebody is already getting and put it through a different partner
3134834 that is not interesting and doesnt make any sense for us we also dont want something where we are just going to have to manage conflict out there

3134843 the republicans had a winning issue that i think yall just knocked the props out from right underneath em
3134844 finally senator mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the vast majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do
3134845 so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
3134846 while i respect our senators desire to find legislation that reaches consensus with senate democrats the american people are more interested in lower gas prices than in senate procedural pleasantries

3134907 the homosexual lobby has been extremely effective in aligning itself with minority groups it is ever present at the service each year for the holocaust memorial as if to create for themselves the image of a group of people under persecution we neglect the gay movement at our peril
3134908 i take it youre beginning to see that there is a huge and well orchestrated conspiracy taking place which the catholic community completely missed

3134951 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
3134952 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
3134953 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
3134954 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
3134955 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
3134956 fall will begin mid august and it will be peaking there the end of august and first week of september
3134957 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
3134958 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
3134959 are always the first to sell out the high demand for the last part of august is because of the fall colors
3134960 near the coast is the last place youll find color
3134961 from mid september to late october we see a variation of fall color rolling through from the western upper peninsula to the southeastern portion of the state
3134962 the lakes tend to pop toward the last moment mid to late october
3134963 that makes it look like evening in the middle of the day
3134964 its not uncommon to see trees turning colors sometimes even later than the first week of november
3134965 in the fall the leaves of the tree turn beautiful shades of pink and magenta

3135032 hundreds of grasshoppers in the water washed up on the beach and hopping on the beach in the sand on people on chairs umbrellas etc very weird
3135033 i was wondering if anyone knows why the beaches have been plagued with grasshoppers they are floating in the ocean and taking over the beaches yesterday on the beach was like grasshopper d day my bro was on the beach 2 days ago and said he didnt see a single grasshopper and now you cant walk 10 feet without one trying to jump on you kinda cool really weird

3135036 my family and i also experienced the grasshopper invasion from the water to the beach and onto us and everything around us i cannot wait to find out what the story is about the grasshoppers we have been coming to ocean city for 32 years and have never seen this happen before
3135037 hardly any seagulls around normally there are tons to eat the grasshoppers is something environmental weather related phenomena or possibly an omen

3135068 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3135069 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3135070 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

3135073 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3135074 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3135075 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

3135077 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3135078 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3135079 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3135080 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3135081 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3135082 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3135083 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3135084 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3135085 concert raises more than 73 800 for shooting victims families
3135086 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3135087 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3135088 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3135089 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3135090 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3135091 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3135092 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3135093 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3135094 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3135095 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3135096 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3135097 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3135098 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3135099 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3135100 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3135101 who have uploaded at least one photo or video with a particular camera on a given day over the last year
3135102 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3135103 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3135104 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3135105 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3135106 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3135107 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3135109 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3135110 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3135111 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3135112 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3135113 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3135114 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3135115 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3135116 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3135117 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3135118 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3135119 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3135120 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3135121 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3135122 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3135123 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3135124 the collaboration will assist both countries in defining the continental shelf in the arctic ocean

3135133 m s que un problema de jayo es un problema de alianza lima porque lo correcto hubiese sido que el club se comunique con la directiva de jos g lvez y le diga que tiene inter s en juan jayo legario
3135134 si las tres partes se pon an de acuerdo el futbolista pod a regresar a alianza lima y no hab a ning n problema
3135135 ac se ha generado todo un tema medi tico porque creo que no actuaron bien los directivos de alianza lima si le propusieron a jayo regresar creo que lo primero que tuvieron que hacer los dirigentes fue comunicarse con sus pares de jos g lvez y se hubiesen evitado tanto manoseo y tanta discusi n innecesaria
3135136 este es un tema de formas m s all de posiciones si algo intent jayo legario fue no jugar por jos g lvez para tener la posibilidad de estar habilitado para hacerlo por alianza lima
3135137 hay que ver primero si g lvez tiene un reglamento interno de trabajo donde esto una sanci n econ mica est tipificado en un documento legal jos g lvez tiene todo el derecho de molestarse y de reclamar porque ellos hicieron todo el esfuerzo para contratar al jugador

3135142 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3135143 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3135144 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3135145 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3135146 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3135147 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3135165 if somebody came to us and said we need to create this scene for a movie id say sure we can do that from creating it to making sure that it was seamless enough that you couldnt tell it was faked sure
3135166 whether anybody really caught this and thought oh you mean this is on tape or on film i dont know if anybody made that connection they didnt beat people over the head with the information or go out of their way to say what you are seeing is fake that tells me they had an idea what was going on and probably thought no big deal one way or the other
3135167 i dont think anybody is going to chastize them there are worse things than that and it doesnt seem to be hurting them so far
3135168 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3135169 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3135170 its nice to be known for something good like that
3135171 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3135172 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3135173 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality hes that type of guy thats going to put his head down and barrel on

3135185 boiling everything down is arbitrage they buy low and sell higher presumably after adding some secret technology special sauce since there are tons of these companies right now and they are all offering pretty much the same value proposition the only real lever that they have to compete on is cost and here the cost is totally defined in direct response metrics cost per click cost per action cost per application and so on
3135186 basic free market theory suggests that this will be a run to the bottom each turn of the wheel will net lower and lower gross costs to the network and net costs to the publisher what is more this model totally focuses the agency and eventually the client on dr metrics with no attention paid to the brand given some of the placements that these networks produce campaigns that run through them can often actually devalue the marketer brand but since the focus in not on that end of the paradigm no one is paying attention to it

3135259 quite simply the law demands more specific knowledge as to which items are infringing and which seller is listing those items before requiring ebay to take action
3135260 unfortunately the trial court incorrectly held that trademark holders and not ebay are responsible for policing the ebay site the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3135261 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3135262 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting
3135263 the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement

3135366 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3135367 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3135368 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3135369 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3135370 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3135371 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3135372 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3135373 we hope it will impact how cities look at their trees
3135374 obviously a lot of cities havent yet stepped back and said why do we do this the way we do it
3135375 we need to look at ordinances across multiple states and see if there are common features we havent done that
3135376 without a current inventory you cant write a street tree management plan
3135377 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3135378 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3135379 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3135380 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3135381 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3135382 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3135383 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3135384 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future
3135385 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3135386 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times
3135387 we want families to provide their child with an environment in which they not only learn how to eat healthy but have the opportunity to practice what they learn
3135388 and by partnering with parents as teachers we now can disseminate this program to their sites nationwide this further impacts healthy eating patterns in parents and their preschool children
3135389 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3135390 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3135391 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3135392 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3135393 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3135394 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
3135395 more efficiently and avoid misusing it to regulate global climate change
3135396 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3135397 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3135398 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3135399 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3135400 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3135401 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3135402 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3135403 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3135404 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3135405 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act

3135412 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3135413 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3135414 wanting is like wanting to touch a star you know youll never reach it but you have to keep trying
3135415 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3135416 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3135417 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3135418 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3135419 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3135420 i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on
3135421 the one guys loyalty and passion over there i dont question is his i think we have eliminated any and all excuses now no one can point any fingers
3135422 we respect cobi hes stepping in and filling a void whether or not cobis comfortable being the head coach or whether or not he has the experience well play that one by ear cobi certainly will have a voice in this
3135423 its been a situation that unfortunately we havent brought guys in
3135424 i control what i can control come out every day and get our guys as good as we can im pleased with the top of our roster but we need to add to the bottom of our roster we need more competition
3135425 hes a great guy with talent a good nose for the ball he brings a lot to the game im excited to have him here
3135426 he can cover tight ends play defense play the run so im excited to have him

3135430 so to lay a whole new level of change and even more uncertainty for the business i think would be a real challenge for telecom and could in fact increase costs with perhaps some rather uncertain benefits
3135431 that cant intrinsically be good value for long term holders of a telecommunications stock
3135432 there is not a wider concerted offer behind what we have put together today so far
3135433 without a full scale shareholder revolt it appears an uphill battle to turn around the company
3135434 telecom has carefully considered the implications of structural separation and does not believe that separating our retail and network businesses would be in the best interest of shareholders at this time
3135435 i dont know if im confident but were hopeful that we will and i understand weve narrowed it down to at least a smaller group of people
3135436 my dilemma is that i only have a vague image of who it was who was talking to me and id hate to pin it on the wrong person but you know if you see faces again they can revive memories so well just have to see
3135437 were just quietly and methodically working our way through it
3135438 fridays opening ceremonies not only marked the beginning of the summer olympics from beijing china it also marked the start of nbcs ambitious plans to offer streaming coverage of olympic events to both computers and mobile devices
3135439 nbc which holds exclusive u s broadcast rights to the games plans to offer live streaming of more than 2 200 hours on its web site while posting another 3 500 hours of archived video but if you use an iphone or a powerpc based mac youll find yourself shut out of the festivities
3135440 at amp t wireless the iphones exclusive service provider in the u s has also struck a deal to become the exclusive provider of mobile video for the olympics the company has a republishing deal with nbc where live competition footage is available to customers of at amp t mobile tv a premium content service that costs an additional 15 to 30 per month on top of existing cell phone plans but the at amp t mobile tv service isnt available to iphone only compatible with lg vu and samsung access phones at this time whats more at amp t mobile tv service is largely limited only to major urban markets
3135441 as for nbc its official olympics web site offers a media rich environment with plenty of images statistics and other information the site also features video recaps of events and live video coverage as it happens nbc has teamed up with microsoft to enable the live video capabilities the site leverages silverlight microsofts streaming media software that the company has positioned as a competitor to adobes dominant flash media software unfortunately silverlight doesnt work on the iphone at all the software depends on a plug in technology like flash which isnt compatible with the iphones safari web browser

3135506 binational lgbt couples and families can be cruelly torn apart by deportation and immigration laws that treat them as legal strangers
3135507 we must fight for family laws that give our children strong legal ties to their parents
3135508 the ultimate irony of gay liberation is that it has made it possible for straight people to create more fluid gender sexual and social identities while mainstream gay people salivate over state sanctioned tiffany wedding bands and participatory patriarchy many straight people know that marriage is outdated tacky and oppressive and any queer who grew up in or around marriage should remember this well marriage still exists as a central site of anti woman anti child and anti queer violence and a key institution through which the wealth and property of upper class white families is preserved if gay marriage proponents wanted real progress theyd be fighting for the abolition of marriage duh and universal access to the services that marriage can sometimes help procure housing healthcare citizenship tax breaks and inheritance rights
3135509 if gay marriage proponents wanted real progress theyd be fighting for the abolition of marriage
3135510 with marriage comes responsibility to another human being this is not awesome
3135511 marriage in this country equals tax breaks and protection for children thats pretty much it its a legal contract
3135512 many straight people know that marriage is outdated tacky and oppressive and any queer who grew up in or around marriage should remember this well marriage still exists as a central site of anti woman anti child and anti queer violence and a key institution through which the wealth and property of upper class
3135513 but for the most part queer people support community and each other and processes that heteros are not familiar with we challenge ourselves to look outside the box since most of us were kicked out of the box at some point we interact with each other in our various subcultures and attempt to support kids that some heteros disown simply because they are queer

3135562 they ask questions share knowledge and build a community of practice that nasa hopes will lead them to pursue careers in fields critical to nasa and the nation
3135563 we are very pleased with our results for the second quarter and first half of the year and in particular the continued strong performance of our engineering segment in both the federal and state infrastructure markets although our energy business has underperformed to date compared to last year at this time we are encouraged by its steady improvement during the first six months of this year
3135564 the company remains committed to its business strategy of organic growth acquisitions and improving business processes in engineering as well as continuing to evaluate strategic options for the energy business
3135565 despite strong opposition from its own shareholders and other constituencies and the severe antitrust regulatory and financing challenges associated with its unsolicited proposal to acquire republic waste management is pushing ahead with its attempt to disrupt our two companies strategic plans with another offer that pales in comparison to the significant value that will be generated through the combination of republic and allied
3135566 the revised offer of 37 per share remains inferior to the range of values supporting the merger of republic and allied waste especially after recognizing that no consideration has been given for a control premium
3135567 waste managements suggestion that its proposal presents less risk on regulatory matters than a republic allied combination is pure tactical rhetoric that should be rejected out of hand
3135568 perhaps the greatest loss resulting from waste managements hostile offer to acquire republic would be the benefits that would flow from the pending allied waste republic transaction itself
3135569 even if waste management were to propose to federal and state regulators a massive piecemeal dismemberment of republic as a remedy for the serious and widespread antitrust issues inherent to a hypothetical waste management republic combination the process of identifying and evaluating those potential remedies would be protracted and complex
3135570 furthermore waste managements offer to pay republic a 250 million break up fee if waste management does not close its hypothetical acquisition of republic for antitrust reasons would hardly be adequate compensation for the disruption resulting from the abandonment of our definitive agreement
3135571 the execution risks inherent to waste managements proposed transaction are in fact so great that one can only wonder whether its unsolicited offer is nothing but a brazen attempt to distract the management teams and ultimately to prevent allied and republic from forming a new company that would have a higher revenue growth profile and significantly higher operating margins than waste management and help maintain the industrys competitive dynamic
3135572 waste managements own shareholders have publicly voiced their concerns about the challenges faced by waste management even at the level of its prior unsolicited offer to acquire republic
3135573 we are committed to not allowing waste management to distract allied from supporting the merger and integration of republic and allied for the benefit of our two companies shareholders employees and customers republic and allied have made significant progress in moving through the regulatory review process which remains on track and within expectations and the two companies have put into place a strong integration plan that will enable our combined company to timely achieve or exceed the compelling synergies expected to result from the merger we and our advisors continue to work rapidly and effectively to satisfy the second request received from the department of justice and continue to expect regulatory clearance and subsequent completion of this merger by the fourth quarter of 2008
3135574 the bank has performed well through its second quarter and intends to continue as a reliable source of wholesale funding
3135575 we look forward to working closely with the newly established regulator to ensure the continued strength of the bank
3135576 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
3135577 while our finance income has contracted due to the transfer of our large portfolio purchase in march of 2007 to cost recovery and our slower than usual buying we continue to seek strategic and disciplined opportunities in our portfolio purchases while we focus on reducing our debt in this difficult economic environment we have been very conservative with regards to new purchases investing only 7 6 million for 289 2 million of face value of charged off consumer receivables during the third quarter total debt as of june 30 2008 was approximately 260 2 million which included 8 3 million in subordinated debt sequentially down from 293 9 million as of march 31 2008 and down from 344 7 million at june 30 2007 as of today our outstanding debt is 240 0 despite the slow economic environment stockholders equity ended the quarter at 17 38 per share at the end of the third quarter a modest sequential increase from 17 19 at the end of the second quarter
3135578 this relationship reflects fresh harvests commitment and success expanding our products in the marketplace by placing our products with a company that is a leading direct marketing and e commerce marketer of high quality premium products we have a significant opportunity to increase our brand awareness throughout the united states we are excited to work with a company that shares our corporate philosophy to benefit our customers employees shareholders and our community
3135579 the first half of 2008 has been difficult both operationally and financially but the landscape is changing there are several major solicitations with awards planned for the second half of the year and into 2009 one is larger than any single soft body armor solicitation in the industrys history we have trusted brands capacity and a proven track record with our customers we are well positioned to capture a fair share of upcoming awards and grow each segment of our business while delays cut into our performance this past quarter they have become the demands for the future
3135580 in addition to our core business we have focused on building an international platform to grow the top line and diversify our geographic footprint the same holds true for our product development and r amp d initiatives we are working closely with suppliers and in tandem with lifestone materials to develop new and innovative solutions in body armor and protective solutions it is our goal to build a diversified business that will generate high returns for our shareholders
3135581 we have been greatly challenged by declining guest traffic and increasing external cost pressures
3135582 we have worked diligently during the second quarter to further reduce both the operating and administrative cost structure of shells our efforts were also heavily focused on implementing the most dramatic menu overhaul in the history of shells our new menu which we introduced in early july included both a roll back of prices as well as a broadening of offerings the menu has been designed to greatly improve our price positioning in light of the current difficult economic environment we believe our menu price proposition and broadened offerings have created a compelling value statement to our guests
3135583 on august 1st we introduced and opened our first rock beach grill which was through the conversion of an existing shells restaurant located in pembroke pines florida we are very excited about the prospects of this new brand
3135584 our utilities delivered a strong performance the addition of the wygen ii facility into our power generation fleet as a rate base asset and increased margins from off system sales more than offset the impact of planned and unplanned outages at key generation facilities during this quarter
3135585 in 2007 our energy marketing business experienced a record year
3135586 oil and gas earnings increased by 64 percent due to higher commodity prices
3135587 coal mining revenues increased due to higher average prices and production but earnings were lower as a result of increased mining costs including overburden removal expenditures depreciation diesel fuel prices and coal taxes
3135588 in addition to running our day to day businesses and through the extraordinary efforts of employees black hills recently completed the two largest transactions in our 125 year history with the sale of seven independent power production gas fired plants to hastings funds management and iif bh investment and the purchase of five utilities from aquila
3135589 the completion of the ipp asset sale and the aquila acquisition are important milestones in the execution of our strategic plan they provide a platform for growth based on a foundation of stable cash flow predictable earnings and increased efficiencies
3135590 other strategic objectives remain on track including the continued development of generation assets current activity at our gillette energy complex includes the ongoing construction of the 100 mw wygen iii plant that is on schedule and on budget and air cooled condenser upgrade projects for the neil simpson ii and wygen i plants that will add over 8 mw of base load energy at each plant at an installed cost of only 995 per kilowatt additionally we recently filed an energy resource plan with the colorado puc proposing the development of 350 mw of natural gas fired generation as well as 64 mw of renewable energy to serve our electric utility customers in colorado we are also voluntarily integrating wind energy into black hills power and cheyenne light fuel amp powers energy portfolio through power purchased from the happy jack wind farm near cheyenne wyoming as a sign of continued confidence in our strategy the black hills board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0 35 per share on july 30 2008
3135591 our third quarter yielded positive results at the operating income line even as our revenues experienced a modest decline reflecting the economic downturn in the housing market our restructuring and cost management efforts have reduced our cost base which has more than offset this decline in revenue in fact despite these economic headwinds and our residential segment volume being down nearly 33 percent this year our gross margin in residential has improved demonstrating our effectiveness in driving productivity enhancements importantly revenues in both our commercial and industrial segments showed double digit annual growth in the third quarter
3135592 we are doing what we said we would when we embarked on this transformation program we have strengthened the foundation of the business restructured into three segments aligned with the customers and markets we serve and reduced our cost structure while simultaneously investing in our infrastructure systems and people all in order to position the business for growth we also continue to improve the quality of our operations and in response to the softening economic conditions in some of our key markets have expanded our restructuring efforts and remain on track to be substantially complete by the end of september
3135593 the growth largely reflects the increased pricing environment and additional barrels sold during the quarter compared to the same period last year

3135598 exxon johns energy policy includes nearly 4 billion in tax cuts to the top five oil corporations complained rothman who stood in the teaneck marriott beside a super sized 2 million check made out to
3135599 he can use my living room if theres another republican he can find
3135600 look i know people here ive represented them in one way or another for 20 years bergen county is going to produce a large plurality for barack obama
3135601 its those ideals that have kept the u s beholden to foreign oil and those are the policies that sen mccain has been associated with
3135602 even though barack obama will not campaign in new jersey his surrogates cannot hide the fact that he voted for the 2005 bush cheney energy bill which contained billions in tax breaks for big oil
3135603 even governor corzine and congressman rothman followed john mccains leadership when they voted against this bill barack obamas vote for this bill may not have been influenced by the large amount of money he continues to raise from the petroleum industry but it certainly shows a lack of judgment and principle as well as an unwillingness to fight the parochial special interests of his state
3135604 barack obama has said he is willing to consider limited offshore drilling if the republicans are willing to join him in this fundamental shift away from foreign sources of energy
3135605 hes saying im willing to listen to your requests for drilling in those states that want it but as part of a comprehensive plan including alternatives nuclear and clean coal to me that sounds very presidential very nonpartisan
3135606 each side is willing to compromise while sen mccain is not willing to compromise
3135607 sen obama has tremendous appeal to everyone in new jersey
3135608 the people of new jersey are smart enough to know that we cannot afford another four years of bush cheney mccain represents the thinking of the past we hope barack obama comes here often we love to see him but if comes here only once or twice or not at all so be it
3135609 our treatment tip sales remained strong in the quarter despite the slowdown in the aesthetics market a strong testament to the efficacy and popularity of thermage procedures
3135610 while overall revenue from systems sales declined we sold the second highest number of system upgrades in the recent second quarter since the introduction of the nxt in first quarter of 2007 we were also pleased with the continued growth in the number of customers subscribing to our infinity partner plans which offer existing customers flexibility through volume and pricing options
3135611 we are extremely excited about our pending acquisition of reliant
3135612 the transaction will bring together two of the market leaders in skin tightening and skin resurfacing complementary technologies that can address a wide range of skin conditions and help us expand our presence domestically and overseas
3135613 the environment remains challenging we continue to benefit from end user demand due to our broad range of tips and procedures brand recognition and demonstrated results innovative partner programs like the infinity program help us maintain and grow our clinician customer base while driving additional procedures our focus over the remainder of 2008 will be on increasing systems sales especially in international markets generating strong recurring revenue from the sale of treatment tips and closing the reliant transaction

3135631 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3135632 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3135633 last i heard he was doing some online stuff in china
3135634 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3135635 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3135636 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3135638 its not something i planned but i just dont get asked out any more
3135639 men seem to look at me and think she went out with george clooney what chance have i got
3135640 the hardest thing is dealing with people who think i was going out with george to further my career in fact offers almost totally dried up people assumed i wouldnt be interested in modelling again
3135641 well barring an extravagant invitation like to wimbledon or fire island or catalina or hy res i like
3135642 i could see the pain in his eyes he was undergoing massive pain what drugs do to you
3135643 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3135644 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3135645 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3135646 the infrastructure was pretty much a hodge podge of different disparate pieces and systems that had been cobbled together by a couple of previous is directors so basically it was a swamp
3135647 i was looking for a monitoring surveillance tool that would allow me to identify detect and troubleshoot problems long before the phones started ringing or the executives beat me up in the hallways because the network was down
3135648 i had tremendous success with groundwork while working for another company
3135649 because of the fact it was open source it was far cheaper the company itself was a great implementer and the tool was geared towards the type of monitoring surveillance that i needed in my business thats ultimately why i selected it a lot of it was price driven but there was a lot of functionality decisions that i made based on groundwork groundwork requires far far less support than most of the other primary proprietary software vendors
3135650 at the end of the day it allowed me to get out of the 80 availability circus that was going on here
3135651 were at four 9s now 99 99 and have been four 9s over the last three years the second benefit was with care and feeding some of the major proprietary software packages that ive rolled out have required a one or two headcount on a dedicated basis right now we think managing the groundwork solution is about one third of one persons time per year another of the more compelling benefits that we were able to derive was people remain far more productive because there was far less downtime with the systems
3135652 businesses are doing a lot of intelligent things with open source solutions by wrapping other software packages around them and making them solutions instead of just software packages id encourage my peers to be more comfortable with open source solutions

3135660 we did everything we could but we ran out of time i will continue to have treatment from an osteopath and hopefully i will be ready for the u s open

3135722 seriously how did they hold that formation for that long communism thats how
3135723 basically fundamentally television was a performers medium and news and current affairs were the sideshow
3135724 one of the reasons that i honestly believe that the care taken on light entertainment had to be the same care as was taken for ballet or opera or serious drama is because you are contributing to the culture of the country i think its sad if it isnt
3135725 its a very sad day to lose him he knew about the business he knew about television
3135726 he was responsible for what i think was the golden age of bbc television which well never have again
3135727 he knew how to treat performers he knew how to talk to them how to get them to do things even if they didnt want to he talked them into it because he knew it would be good for them
3135728 without him i dont think the show would have gone on he undoubtedly had a nose for a hit
3135729 he was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us absolutely to the hilt
3135730 he was an entrepreneur he was a showman and theres not many of his type about any more im afraid we shall miss him terribly i loved him

3135747 quite simply the law demands more specific knowledge as to which items are infringing and which seller is listing those items before requiring ebay to take action
3135748 unfortunately the trial court incorrectly held that trademark holders and not ebay are responsible for policing the ebay site the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3135749 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3135750 our intent with the new tag is to give people a chance to make a statement and to show they care for has the second largest market for recyclables in the entire country only trailing

3135753 our continued focus on expenses resulted in cash flow positive results for our fifth consecutive quarter and we are pleased to begin to see the positive impacts from both the launch of our new mp3 store and the expansion of napster mobile the introduction of mp3 s into our line up has created positive trends for napster with increases to visitation and user engagement in addition track sales per subscriber were up 10 in july month over month with total track sales up 5 during the same period the roll out of napster mobile is driving forward and napster compatible handsets will expand by millions of new units in the coming months we expect that napster mobile will make the most significant contribution to our growth in fiscal 2009 bolstered by the integration of mp3 sales into our product line up
3135754 we expect our second fiscal quarter revenue to be approximately 30 million depending on the pace of our napster mobile roll outs including new compatible handsets and carrier promotions as well as other new marketing initiatives we are targeting a relatively flat spend during the second quarter excluding one time items considering our stronger holiday seasonal patterns and the anticipated further expansion of napster mobile later this year we expect revenue to increase in the second half of fiscal 2009

3135764 our electronic court records ecr system is a big time saver for kcdc employees and legal professionals who regularly access court records
3135765 the cost savings are huge because countless hours and reams of paper have been cut from the process
3135766 it required a huge amount of space to store our records
3135767 a lot of time was consumed hunting for physical files and moving them around the organization
3135768 every 12 hours the centera servers send me a report on how much data is on them and how much space is available
3135769 currently the total capacity for each is 9539 gb with remaining free capacity of 6038 gb on each one
3135770 some of our police agencies now report probable cause statements to the booking facility using their laptops or a kiosk in the jail and the prosecutor transmits them electronically to the emc information infrastructure
3135771 weve automated the process to the extent that human hands seldom have to touch paper documents and the documents themselves have never existed in paper
3135772 my next big project is to bring more tickets over into our digital system
3135773 we have to pay attention to various different mandated periods for document retention

3135777 nfs is getting pressure from clustered file systems like lustre and gpfs as well as custom file systems produced by web 2 0 service providers such as google gfs
3135778 even for files too small to stripe those files can be distributed across multiple nfs servers which provides statistical load balancing
3135779 with a capable cluster of nfs servers and a back end file system files or ranges within files can be relocated transparent to the applications accessing data over pnfs
3135780 pnfs moves the metadata server out of the data transfer path
3135781 instead of having to deal with a number of competing proprietary and open source parallel file systems pnfs will allow users to reap the benefits of parallel storage systems by choosing best of breed solutions without having concerns over vendor lock in
3135782 for environments that need improved performance for large sequential files where parallel access is needed pnfs has some legs moving forward
3135783 however not every environment or application needs parallel access to data
3135784 for mainstream markets pnfs will most likely remain a niche at least near term being used for specialized applications and environments
3135785 the big benefactors of pnfs will be the parallel file systems like those from ibm sun ibrix and others as well as proprietary storage systems like those from panasas
3135786 the architecture for the pnfs proposal was derived from the panasas directflow parallel protocol which is a core component utilized by the panasas panfs parallel file system
3135787 the directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfs 4 1 later this year

3135813 georgia has implemented far reaching political economic and military reforms
3135814 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3135815 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3135816 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

3135823 he has shown himself through words and actions to be a true friend to the environment however the reversal of his position toward offshore drilling combined with his shrugging off of mccains negative vote toward the restoration of the everglades reek of political opportunism
3135824 eric cantor has a history of blindly following the failed regressive policies of the bush administration and the republican party as a whole voting nearly 100 percent of the time with the bush administration throughout his cantors congressional career that having been said it pretty much goes without saying that cantor is once again siding with the republican party and the big oil companies and promoting a regressive energy policy that will provide virtually no long or short term relief for average americans struggling with gas and energy prices cantor a potential vp candidate republican presidential nominee john mccain and the republican party as a whole are once again showing where their true allegiance lies with the big oil companies that have upported their party for years a prolific fundraiser for the campaign

3135981 fortunately no one died but several houses have been destroyed
3135982 at minimum the occupation of south ossetia and abkhazia or else the occupation and enslavement of the whole of georgia
3135983 if yesterday they were saying they were responding to our operation in south ossetia today they are saying that the aim of the operation is to change the regime in georgia and end our independence
3135984 our reporters are working in some very risky areas and are taking on some very edgy topics
3135985 what do you tell a woman with two black eyes
3135986 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games

3135990 its still too early to say how many people have been killed or injured by the fighting
3135991 but our visits to these hospitals confirm that local medical facilities are dealing with a large number of wounded and dead
3135992 the u s military instructors directly command and coordinate actions of mercenaries without being involved in actual fighting the source specified according to intelligence data there are roughly 1 000 military instructors of the united states in georgia
3135993 task force of russia has annihilated a few groups of mercenaries some of mercenaries have been captured and investigators are working with them the source said
3135994 we have detained 10 agents of the georgian special services who were spying on military facilities and preparing terrorist attacks including on russian territory

3136007 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3136008 you need witnesses youve got to build a case and youve got to identify suspects
3136009 the aclu of connecticut opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
3136010 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
3136011 people who were offshoring high value jobs are increasing the intensity of that and people who were not are now in the planning stage
3136012 to me the kasbah is the perfect setting for a mystery novel because it is a mysterious place
3136013 the roots of this go back through the turkish period to the ayyubids and right way to the romans
3136014 as a journalist youre really only looking to assess whats happening right now why its happening
3136015 but as a writer of fiction i want to know the most emotionally real elements of a town
3136016 did you have any trouble with the martyrs brigades sentries on the way up here abu ramiz
3136017 but no one played the big hero with me tonight in fact there didnt seem to be many of them around
3136018 you know that those great fighters for the freedom of the palestinian people are always the first to get out of here when the israelis come
3136019 i was reading a little today in that lovely old bible you gave me abu ramiz
3136020 its not the religious message you see god knows if there were no bible and no koran how much happier would our troubled little town be if the famous star had shone for the wise men above lets say baghdad instead of bethlehem life would be much brighter here
3136021 its only that this bible in particular makes me think of all that you did for me
3136022 when i emigrated to chile i kept the bible you gave me close always
3136023 the old house is the same as ever filled with racks of dads wedding dresses the rentals in the living room and those for sale in his bedroom all wrapped in plastic
3136024 but now theyre almost crowded out by my antique sideboards from syria and elaborate old mirrors that dont seem to sell
3136025 mirrors are you surprised that no one should be able to look themselves in the eye these days
3136026 they lead us further into corruption and violence every day and no one can do anything about it the town is run by a shitty tribe of uneducated bastards whove got the police scared of them
3136027 you know ive been thinking about that the martyrs brigades they come up here and shoot across the valley at gilo and the israelis fire back and then come in with their tanks my house has been hit a few times when the bastards did their shooting from my roof and drew the israeli fire i found a bullet in my kitchen wall that came in the salon window went through a thick wooden door and traveled down a hallway before it made a big hole in my refrigerator
3136028 i can say what i feel about the martyrs brigades because i have a big clan here they wouldnt threaten me unless they were prepared to face the anger of half of dehaisha but you george youre a christian you dont have the same protection
3136029 maybe ive lived too long away from here to accept things
3136030 perhaps i just cant forget what you taught me about living a principled life
3136031 you know who else has returned to bethlehem from our old crowd
3136032 you havent seen him yet well hes only been back a week im sure hell stop by your house once hes settled in
3136033 yes but since then hes been living in rome as some kind of apostolic secretary to one of the cardinals now hes back at the church of the nativity i know elias and i are only asking for trouble by coming home abu ramiz perhaps you cant understand what it has been like for us we grow up in this dismal place wanting desperately to leave for another country where we can make money and live in peace but the day always comes when you imagine the savor of real hummus and the intoxicating brightness of the sun on the hills and the sound of the church bells and the muezzins you miss it so much you can taste the longing on your tongue then you come back no matter what it is you are giving up you just cant help it
3136034 ill go to the church and say hello to elias as soon as i get a chance
3136035 next month is christmas so i wanted to invite you to come with us to the church to celebrate
3136036 and then you and umm ramiz will come for christmas dinner at my house
3136037 jesus i think they might be on my roof again
3136038 dont worry about me get out of here before the israelis come not even your big clan will protect you from them goodbye abu ramiz
3136039 dont worry little miral daddys going to tell the men to stop playing and making noise
3136040 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3136041 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3136042 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3136043 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia

3136065 russian forces are occupying gori georgian armed forces received an order to leave gori and to fortify positions near mtskheta to defend the capital this is a total onslaught
3136066 this provocation was aimed at occupying south ossetia abkhazia and then all of georgia
3136067 is no longer a man that we can deal with
3136068 he must be punished for breaching international law he is responsible for many war crimes
3136069 nobody was listening and this is the result we have finally come to it however russia will of course carry out its peacekeeping mission to its logical end
3136070 there was an atmosphere of war about to break out from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
3136071 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore

3136078 the new players have come from big leagues croatia and holland and i think that these games are fairly easy for them
3136079 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3136080 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3136081 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3136082 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3136083 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3136084 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3136085 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3136086 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3136091 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame

3136114 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3136115 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
3136116 livestock and poultry are our number one customer consuming 98 percent of the u s soybean meal used domestically
3136117 the u s pork industry specifically uses about 25 percent of the domestically used soybean meal so there is a strong partnership between soybean farmers and pork producers
3136118 net energy for swine becomes more important as corn becomes more expensive
3136119 increasing energy from soybeans may provide added nutritional value so the soybean checkoff is funding research to look at this issue
3136120 the national pork board appreciates the working relationship we have developed with the united soybean board
3136121 especially during this time of rising feed costs net energy is a new look at how feeds can be formulated to meet the needs of pigs as well as a way to possibly save producers money this research is going to help us be much smarter with our feed

3136133 wed hoped that was the beginning of an opening in the democratic space
3136134 but the political space is contracting again its clear the ruling party is determined to stay in power by any means
3136135 i dont think the political space is in any way being constrained
3136136 they dont claim they want a socialist state but the ideology is still there
3136137 the international community espouses ideas about good governance transparency and human rights but then they help a regime that flouts and violates those fundamental rights

3136147 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
3136148 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
3136149 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
3136150 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely

3136154 antioxidant capacity and other bioactivities of the freeze dried amazonian palm berry euterpe oleraceae mart
3136155 a ai fruit from the south american tropics has the strongest antioxidant properties yet observed and has high promise for entering first world markets as a functional food ingredient
3136156 extracts from acai berries triggered a self destruct response in up to 86 of leukemia cells tested
3136157 also contains every essential and non essential amino acid that humans require also very rare in single food sources
3136158 a lot of claims are being made but most of them havent been tested scientifically we are just beginning to understand the complexity of the acai berry and its health promoting effects
3136159 acai berries are already considered one of the richest fruit sources of antioxidants
3136160 this study was an important step toward learning what people may gain from using beverages dietary supplements or other products made with the berries
3136161 this was only a cell culture model and we dont want to give anyone false hope
3136162 we are encouraged by the findings however compounds that show good activity against cancer cells in a model system are most likely to have beneficial effects in our bodies
3136163 one reason so little is known about acai berries is that theyre perishable and are traditionally used immediately after picking
3136164 products made with processed acai berries have only been available for about five years so researchers in many parts of the world have had little or no opportunity to study them
3136165 a lot of claims are being made but most of them havent been tested scientifically
3136166 we are just beginning to understand the complexity of the acai berry and its health promoting effects

3136181 mathias dahlgren was actually quite recently awarded with a star in the michelin red guide actually all of the places ive listed have a star in the red guide
3136182 er we were thinking something that has more like 4 or 5 stars
3136183 the mirrors are all gray and dusty and all the chandeliers look very old and worn youd think that when they spend so much money on the tour that they could at least clean it up in st petersburg everything was so shiny yeah sure they renovate everything so that it looks brand new but you really could do at least something to make it look nicer

3136199 the general assumption is that anemia is a disorder and that patients would be better off without it
3136200 these factors may promote the long term use of proton pump inhibitors leaving patients at increased risk of osteoporosis related fractures
3136201 once patients have developed trust in their surgeons they are willing to wait unless their pain becomes unbearable
3136202 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3136203 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3136204 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3136205 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3136206 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells
3136207 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes
3136208 there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved
3136209 we hope it will impact how cities look at their trees
3136210 obviously a lot of cities havent yet stepped back and said why do we do this the way we do it
3136211 we need to look at ordinances across multiple states and see if there are common features we havent done that
3136212 without a current inventory you cant write a street tree management plan
3136213 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3136214 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3136215 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3136216 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future
3136217 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3136218 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times

3136231 the maritime practice fits well with our integrated platform as the practice complements several core squire sanders practices including aviation communications energy environmental international dispute resolution litigation and structured finance
3136232 squire sanders believes its important for our lawyers to combine in depth industry knowledge with strong legal expertise in order to best serve the needs of our clients our new colleagues have an unparalleled grasp of the regulatory transactional and advocacy issues facing the maritime industry and other industries affected by maritime law

3136237 what do martes numbers look like if you pitch him no more than one inning at a time this guy is a short reliever lefty specialist i know off the top of my hear that at least five of those seven runs have come when girardi tried to get a second inning from the guy four of them on swing when martes pitch count was sailing into the 40s on a 100 degree night in texas what girardi is doing with marte abusing him is no different at least in my view that what torre did with proctor and some others

3136241 more efficiently and avoid misusing it to regulate global climate change
3136242 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3136243 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3136244 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3136245 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3136246 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3136247 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3136248 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale

3136268 we honor the principle that a current spouse has no obligation to support someone elses child while accounting for the reality that the current spouse may provide economic resources to the household
3136269 the problem is new jersey does not give same sex couples like jim and mark odonnell the freedom to marry and to be legally equal spouses
3136270 when the law gives a couple responsibilities without equality the law must be changed

3136280 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3136281 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3136282 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3136283 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3136284 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3136285 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3136286 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3136287 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3136288 but with energy costs going up the way they are its a very simple analysis that proves out in the short and certainly in the long term using more energy efficient equipment will benefit you on the bottom line

3136295 but with recent warming the ice is miles from shore and bears are becoming increasingly trapped on land well away from their usual seal prey
3136296 it is ironic that our efforts to understand how climate change is affecting wildlife were disrupted by the top arctic predator displaced by climate
3136297 in our time political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible things like the continuance of british rule in india the russian purges and deportations the dropping of the atom bombs on japan can indeed be defended but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism question begging and sheer cloudy vagueness defenceless villages are bombarded from the air the inhabitants driven out into the countryside the cattle machine gunned the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets this is called pacification

3136309 they must want to make it so i could never join the church they see me as a threat and a large one at that if it takes several guys to take me down and they still canr get the job done there is something wrong there they brought out weapons and other forgein objects to beat my friends back with but i wasnt scared i knew only i could help jeffrey dark at that point i also heard some whispers going about that mr eric was even thinking about striking me with that chair now leave me alone i want some sleep

3136331 let us run with endurance the race that is set before us
3136332 its the most exciting thing on the horizon its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3136333 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their head and having writers on board and producers that are in to it its been a fun thing
3136334 how could i express what i was feeling in a way that didnt sound like bitching about george bush i mean you know i love neil young but i didnt want to listen to that record really
3136335 my reaction to that kind of record is we know this
3136336 so it started with me trying to write it as a piece of fiction i was thinking it could be the worst idea ever in the world but if it doesnt work it doesnt have to come out i started by writing a kind of world bible about what life would be like around 15 or 20 years from now if things continue on the same path i spent a few weeks filling it in with the events that could lead to this kind of time and place then as an experiment i started writing songs about people in this place and from different points of view
3136337 i had a record that would make sense to me but no one else would ever know what it was because there was no narrative its modular its a collection of snapshots these were glimpses of a place maybe with liner notes i could communicate some of it but how do you get liner notes in 2007
3136338 that was the route we were going to go with initially we talked to a different companies about releasing it but it didnt feel quite right we thought about a film but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right then i started thinking about how i could make it really interactive something you experience rather than something you read
3136339 i just pitched it to hbo two weeks ago in l
3136340 yeah i bet you could feel that karma staring you in the face already

3136347 its really really difficult to look at where we might be in terms of caring for ben or what bens situation will be in a months time
3136348 if we treat our customers as our best friends we build customers trust and loyalty
3136349 its an offense that has real consequences and weve tended to treat it as more of a nuisance
3136350 youre going to have all these nonviolent offenders with slam dunk cases against them
3136351 you dont even know yourself until you compete in something like that
3136352 the no 1 thing we learned is to read our directions

3136354 the fierce competitor in you comes out you dont even know yourself until you compete in something like that
3136355 i almost wish i wasnt in charge of it so i could participate

3136359 the rides are fellowship opportunities for our church members but we hold bible studies with the rides to reach people who are non christians and then we take christian literature to share with people we meet along the trail
3136360 the important thing about our church is that people can be who they are
3136361 people like that one they dont have to dress up and two our people are genuine some of our people like to look at horses and be around horses but they would be afraid to actually get on one but they like our cowboy church its not about a building its about the people
3136362 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3136363 they can do what they want with it but he doesnt remember anything he remembers nothing before 1993 except for little bits and pieces
3136364 vmwares portfolio is exclusively virtualization with no divestiture and the hypervisor is being commoditized
3136365 clearly there are serious challenges but joe tucci emcs chairman knows whats going on in the market diane green did a great job but going forward he needed someone who thinks differently
3136366 vmwares next big opportunity is to become the infrastructure provider for cloud computing
3136367 all of the services we provide are os and application independent users dont want the headaches of all the configuration and customization that is common today
3136368 our vision of cloud computing has to do with how enterprise computing resources become pools of resources available to a variety of applications
3136369 enterprises dont care about the application or the os as such what enterprises want are productivity and performance what they want are service levels that can be agreed upon and measured they care about performance parameters about downtime about charge backs our vision of cloud computing is that applications will become platform agnostic it wont matter where they physically reside where users access them from or even what devices those users choose
3136370 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3136371 the key is for them to talk about how they have handled it so they learn from each other not necessarily from the person in the white coat

3136384 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3136385 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3136386 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave

3136398 its good to see that kind of reaction because these kind of police killings happen a lot as weve seen in the last 20 years theres been about 2 per year but if theres no public reaction then the case will be forgotten and fall out of the news and nobodys gonna think about it anymore
3136399 a war engaged in by all or most of the principal nations of the world
3136400 he advocates the full repeal of doma which goes farther than hillary clinton who only recommended repealing part of the defense of marriage act
3136401 hes talking about opening up the military to homosexuality in a time of war hes talking about gay adoption putting children in homes that are intentionally fatherless or intentionally motherless and using the white house bully pulpit to do that
3136402 that makes obama the first presidential candidate to actually support homosexual marriage when youre congratulating homosexuals for their supposed marriage thats being for and celebrating homosexual marriage
3136403 i think the central question of this election is this can barack obama take these extremely radical pro homosexual positions and yet still pull the wool over the eyes of enough american evangelicals to win the election
3136404 steve jobs apples chief executive has confirmed there is a kill switch built into the iphone operating system that allows apple to remotely delete malicious or inappropriate applications stored on the device
3136405 iphone and ipod touch owners are able to install additional software on their devices purchased from the apple application store
3136406 mr jobs insisted that the so called kill switch was there as a precaution rather than a function that was routinely used
3136407 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull said mr jobs
3136408 mr jobs also announced that in the month since the iphone 3g was released and the application store launched around 60 million applications had been downloaded for the iphone and ipod touch
3136409 what would be the scenario where a kill switch would be necessary

3136418 a muslim brotherhood affiliated organization which was an unindicted co conspirator in last years terrorist financing trial against the holy land foundation
3136419 publicly challenged the designation of hezbollah and hamas as terrorist organizations
3136420 a number of groups that the state department has funded or collaborated with have links to entities such as al qaida hamas and hezbollah all of which are designated as terrorist organizations by the united states government
3136421 legitimizes islamism to the world and sends mixed messages to our allies while sending a terrible message to moderate muslims who are thoroughly disenfranchised by the funding
3136422 inasmuch as barack hussein obama jr was adopted by his step father an indonesian named soetoro and then changed his name back to obama perhaps legally perhaps not i think we should all now refer to him as

3136437 its ready for a tram system if ive ever seen one
3136438 theres no other animal on the planet that can do that
3136439 maintain communication and cooperation links among the citizens of countries whose relationships may otherwise be strained or limited
3136440 as important as it is for the u s government to actively engage in science diplomacy
3136441 they have the flexibility the connections and the know how to engage scientists and pursue good science even in countries where government to government relations are tense and in countries with limited science and technology capacity of their own
3136442 even in times of governmental conflict relationships built on trust and mutual respect will outlast current frictions
3136443 science is often a means to bridge the political chasm that divides nations
3136444 it knows no borders is not constrained by geography and no one country has a monopoly on it
3136445 science was a global activity long before the invention of the term globalization because the advancement of sciences and the issues and challenges of science technology and health programs are predominantly global in nature
3136446 science and technology collaboration solves important human problems and thus contributes directly to security prosperity and health
3136447 they also create those personal relationships and trust that engender peace
3136448 international collaborators know that they can depend on our pariticpation as they develop and commit their share of the funding model
3136449 this limitation can impede the ability of the programs to achieve their overarching goals
3136450 in every aspect of modern life and in every major global policy issue
3136451 not only government to government but critically civil society to civil society
3136452 the pressing need for scientifically accurate biology science education digital library sources and related services
3136453 their primary promotion is to encourage higher education faculty to use ben and encourage them to submit biological sciences education resources to digital libraries
3136454 faculty are looking for teaching resources that help prepare non science majors for public issues related to biological sciences
3136455 teachers as facilitators of learning rather than dispensers of knowledge
3136456 that person will be a better informed voter a great citizen and a healthy person
3136457 the center is to be guided by the over arching goal of using science and scientific cooperation to promote international understanding and prosperity
3136458 aaas believes this use of scientific collaboration and communication is essential both to the advancement of science and its use for the benefit of our global society
3136459 the scope of countries and the scope of topics are much more broad than it was 40 years ago
3136460 none of this is a panacea but it contributes to the long and methodical building of relationships even when there are bumps in the road over the short term
3136461 from my own experience in poland and with the soviet union during the cold war and in the early days of interaction with china as america moved to bridge 25 years of complete separation the relationships that were developed between scientists made real contributions toward creating the very different world we live in today
3136462 today the challenges are different the threats are different but the potential of science to address these problems is as powerful now as it was then the potential for this new center is immense
3136463 these organizations represent the best of u s science and higher education
3136464 and they have the flexibility the connections and the know how to engage scientists and pursue good science even in countries where government to government relationships are tense or limited and in countries with limited s amp t capacity of their own
3136465 i cant think of a better organization to do that and any way we can assist in that well be happy to
3136466 recognition that a lot of the issues we face today globally the issues we face and that the next administration will face have science and technology components
3136467 may be if not the strongest one of the strongest arrows in our foreign policy quiver right now
3136468 the state department congress the white starting to come around on this i think the timing of what alan leshner and vaughan turekian have done in setting up this center couldnt be better
3136469 its a very powerful tool in diplomacy were not talking down to you were saying you regard this is important and we regard this as important so lets find ways that we can engage and in doing that we can try to build a reputation that the united states is a good country to engage with
3136470 get the story straight from the troops without the filter of the liberal media
3136471 intelligence briefings to very important persons vips and senior officers
3136472 in the attachment you will find the letter of response to centcom u s central command about our gold star family member trip to iraq
3136473 would get very good play in the media and tell our story with these dedicated families of our deceased members
3136474 under the cover of utmost secrecy the parents of u s troops who died in iraq have made a surprising and historic visit to iraq
3136475 the trip will allow these parents to see the newly liberated iraq that their children gave their lives for
3136476 a department of defense program that provides opportunities for citizens to show their support for the u s armed forces
3136477 individuals organizations and companies to hundreds of homefront groups offering a variety of support to the military community
3136478 america supports you is not well known i have spoken to about 30 soldiers and marines and only one knew anything about it and that was because he had just seen a psa public service announcement on afn american forces network
3136479 you say i started out with practically nothing but that isnt correct we all start with all there is its how we use it that makes things possible
3136480 there is one thing which gives radiance to everything it is the idea of something around the corner
3136481 does not seem to have a simple closed form solution
3136482 we failed on our travels to find anyone within the complex who could articulate what the current role of the nuclear arsenal is or should be
3136483 the world has changed the world of the missileers has not
3136484 was that the only thing worse than the american presence would be the absence of the american presence
3136485 to see if the billions being spent on preventing nuclear terrorism
3136486 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
3136487 do not cross if you think ross ocarroll kelly is not taking the pi
3136488 an islamic regime must be serious in every field there are no jokes in islam there is no humor in islam there is no fun in islam
3136489 ive learned hard lessons in aviation that you have to stop and say wait a minute things like mission completion syndrome or get there itis can make you do things you wouldnt ordinarily have done before
3136490 part of the time we were working to keep the station alive and part of the time to keep ourselves alive
3136491 retiring the space shuttle program may give nasa a chance to forget its troubled past and pursue the genuine mission it has lacked for years
3136492 when this blocker is in place the potassium physically cannot get through
3136493 the light adds energy to the system that breaks a double bond and reforms the molecule in a different configuration with a kink in it
3136494 the greater the light intensity the greater the probability that one of these molecules is going to get hit by a photon of the right wavelength
3136495 there are people developing microendoscopy which uses light from an optical fiber to image very deep structures in the brain down to single cell resolution
3136496 we might be able to use something like that to regulate neurons deep in the brain
3136497 there are disorders where kids go blind over time because they lose their rods and cones progressively over the first decade of life and once theyre gone theres no bringing them back so far as it stands now the photoreceptors are absolutely required for vision
3136498 so the long term hope is that something like the compounds weve developed might be able to restore sight using cells that arent normally light sensitive
3136499 we do know it remains very stably associated with the channel for up to 24 hours and the neurons in which they find themselves stay sensitive to light
3136500 its not clear if the molecule is being broken down or if the protein target is getting turned over but the duration may be quite different depending on what tissue or what part of the cell youre looking at ion channels turn over rapidly in the cell body but maybe not so much so in the axons
3136501 how does that tune go in porgy and bess where someone sings about not taking the bible literally it aint necessarily so
3136502 slightly less concerned by my inability to master the arcane details of modern genetics since the science itself does not tell us much if anything about how to think about the ethical and political problems it raises
3136503 im going to open up this case im going to sue cair im bringing a lawsuit back against them its going to cost me a fortune
3136504 and when judge illston rejects it again which she will do because shes a minion of the bill clinton crowd im going to take it over her head and im going to go to the 9th circuit court of appeals where again im going to hit a stonewall
3136505 how theyre targeting the midwest talk radio one talk show host at a time one company at a time dont you know that cair is going to come for you
3136506 first they came for michel savage and you didnt raise your voice and you laughed then they came after abercrombie and fitch and you didnt raise your voice because you werent in the retail business tomorrow theyll come after you and your business
3136507 one day youre going to hit the wrong judge in the wrong city at the wrong time and then the american people are going to find out where your funding is coming from
3136508 individuals entities who are and or were members of the us muslim brotherhoods palestine committee and or its organizations
3136509 cairs operational budget is funded by donations from american muslims
3136510 there is nothing criminal or immoral about accepting donations from foreign nationals
3136511 the u s government corporations and non profit organizations routinely receive money from foreign nationals
3136512 bin talal is not a member of the saudi arabian government
3136513 as long as they are not an official of any foreign government and there are no strings attached to the bequest
3136514 the democratic party is not my constituency these are people that believe in socialism i dont
3136515 but the problem is that when its come time to vote in the senate hes been a much better friend of george bush
3136516 we endorse politicians who support the things we believe in good paying jobs decent health care and retirement quality public services and improving the lives of working families
3136517 jim himes has committed to make these issues his priorities as the 4th districts representative in congress
3136518 we will not be outworked were moving full steam ahead
3136519 im not betting my house on it but i believe its extremely doable
3136520 its one thing to get elected to high office with an outspoken wife its quite another to get into a tony country club case in point sen evan bayh d ind an applicant to the blue blooded chevy chase club in suburban washington hes been on probation since his wife susan was overheard yelling at the staff on more than one occasion shes really teed off on some of the help said one member bayh whose name is often brought up as a possible presidential candidate had enjoyed club privileges while his application was being considered
3136521 what we found in blackbaud was a responsive dedicated team and are confident that they will be a sustainable partner
3136522 our old finance program was not built for a nonprofit making our fund accounting practices extremely tedious now our staff will be able to access data for a real time view of the museums finances and operations
3136523 blackbaud solutions will enable us to demonstrate organizational effectiveness to our supporters and create a more meaningful experience for our patrons just as we are a leading museum in renowned exhibits and research it is our strategic goal to be a leader in operations and technology with blackbaud we will achieve these goals
3136524 we are dedicated to the museums long term success and to helping improve its overall operations so that donors and patrons reap the benefits
3136525 with more than 25 years of experience blackbaud has partnered with over 1 500 arts and cultural organizations worldwide by providing solutions that help them meet their unique institutional goals in development finance and retail departments visitors and admissions offices and box offices
3136526 even if i am a minority of one truth is still the truth
3136527 the smallest minority on earth is the individual those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities
3136528 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw
3136529 newer countries with emerging cultures such as the us and australia seem to use international performance as a way of reinforcing their presence and importance on the world stage
3136530 so for them its very black and white winning and losing is the only thing that matters
3136531 maybe we missed this but we werent aware that whinging is an olympic sport
3136532 you cant imagine what its like flashbacks from the fx7 the drug that makes us into new humans waking nightmares you have to seriously take us apart to kill us but the scar tissues all weird and some of the nerves dont grow back properly constant pain headaches sunlight hurts sometimes thats just the top of the list it all come down to one thing man how much do you really want to be a superhero youve got to really want it really want it
3136533 how badly do you want to be a superhero badly enough to get killed for it
3136534 designers have been failing to humanize their work for years
3136535 the problem is that they apply a top down approach where they impose their design onto something or someone yet what they should be doing is thinking of word design as being synonymous with empathy and working from the bottom up
3136536 which means you want to do something that is responsive to peoples needs ambitions and dreams but you also want to do something that makes things happen
3136537 it used to be enough to gracefully respond to identified customer needs for a moment in time but now it is both a privilege and a responsibility to consider a wider array of system elements including social and environmental ecosystems and a timeline that considers the entire lifecycle of objects and infrastructures
3136538 if the goal is to sustainably improve the livelihood of people who do not have their basic needs met
3136539 rockefellers idea was to get ideo to help the design industry move further into the direction of social impact
3136540 and to give them tools to help them work with social sector organizations
3136541 what we wanted ideo to do was to take what theyve learned about innovation in the realm of non profits over the past 10 years
3136542 and see which models work and which ones dont and then apply the best more comprehensively to the non profit world
3136543 the idea was to transfer ideos design knowledge to designers in the developing world so that they could incorporate those ideas into their work and grow their businesses
3136544 is that by taking an empathic approach you make the product relevant to yourself which in turn makes it relevant to others
3136545 it gives you a very efficient incrementalism which is valuable
3136546 but it wont give you disneyland the guggenheim or lord of the rings that takes vision and imagination on the part of the designer after all parisians didnt walk around paris in the early 1900s saying you know what we need we need cubism
3136547 thats when branding became an essential business strategy and as such required designers to take a larger systematic view of the world it also required them to combine aesthetics with psychology anthropology and other social sciences to insure a stronger connection to buyers
3136548 when youre dealing with large abstract issues its crucial that you make them as concrete immediate and personal as possible
3136549 it was designed to help african farmers grow vegetables in the dry season
3136550 and working with that organization awakened us to the power of applying human centered design to some of the toughest problems in the developing world
3136551 obesity is a complex issue that has a variety of cultural medical and socio economic drivers
3136552 but at a basic level it is a problem exacerbated by the fact that culture is suffering from over consumption sustainability and obesity are similar issues in that they are both consumption problems threatening our survival as individuals and society stemming from our culture of abundance and our individual disconnectedness from the impact of our micro behaviors
3136553 marks a trend toward making transparent the development process by tracing the global manufacturing path of a product and highlighting what the company is doing environmentally as well as where they can improve another example is the nau clothing website which provides education about sustainable fabrics and hosts a customer blog site thought kitchen to invite collective inquiry
3136554 the beneficiary of aid is a customer the farmer who buys a kickstart pump as opposed to receiving one will make further demands and refinements which leads to the growth of an entire system and thats what were trying to promote
3136555 i believe that social issues are becoming business issues for example obesity is a business issue as seen by manufacturers of 100 calorie packs and the airline industry which faces rising fuel costs due to passenger weight
3136556 i started at ideo a year ago in that time ive met an astounding number of people who genuinely want to use design to make the world a better place and thats not just designers
3136557 but also philanthropists ngos and foundations where there is genuine passion and excitement about doing this kind of work

3136583 we are pleased to partner with the new jersey audubon society to encourage farmers to undertake these projects that not only protect soil and water resources but increase productivity and profitability for the farmer
3136584 the mini loan program provides the seed money to help farmers take the next step toward implementing practices that improve water quality soil health and diverse habitat
3136585 the farm bill provides many opportunities for farmers to consider in conserving natural resources on their land

3136678 oricum dup trei ani doar de produs tiri i niciun fel de cercetare eficient niciun fel de act de justi ie era normal ca daniel morar s nu mai fie confirmat n func ie sper ca doamna erb nescu s se prezinte la csm cu un plan de management cu o idee despre ce are de f cut n continuare

3136681 where you were what you were doing and how you really felt
3136682 its a good situation that you can ask that question
3136683 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years
3136684 it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3136685 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3136686 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together
3136687 its a long way to catch tiger at the top
3136688 but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me controlling what i can do
3136689 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
3136690 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
3136691 i dodged a bullet because there was some more high profile losers that day
3136692 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major
3136693 and youve got to lose them to know you can win them ive got to put myself in the position and learn from it and understand it before i actually go and do it
3136694 this things going to crest a half a billion soon who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
3136695 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3136696 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3136697 we hear talk of a meeting with the russian leadership offered up as if it were some sudden inspiration a bold new idea that somehow nobody has ever thought of before
3136698 yet its hard to see what such a summit with president medvedev would actually gain
3136699 newer countries with emerging cultures such as the us and australia seem to use international performance as a way of reinforcing their presence and importance on the world stage
3136700 so for them its very black and white winning and losing is the only thing that matters
3136701 maybe we missed this but we werent aware that whinging is an olympic sport
3136702 what would an ethical problem look like in the system of evaluation nietzsche advocates in what ways would things look different what would a bad conscience be like in these circumstances or conscientiousness generally it would look different from what we often call conscientiousness partly because there is no element of humility involved in it can you be conscientious about showing bravado about taking a devil may care attitude in what youre doing
3136703 nietzsche feels that he cannot accept christian ethics similarly someone may feel that he cannot accept nietzschean ethics
3136704 a puritanical land delivered into the hands of women which signifies the same thing as having fallen into a state of absolute decadence
3136705 no one who works in tv gets to ask that question you know where the time comes from it comes from the cognitive surplus youve been masking for 50 years
3136706 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it

3136709 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3136710 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3136711 in fact getting married increases ones risk for eventual marital dissolution and marital dissolution seems to be worse for self rated health now than at any point in the past three decades
3136712 its not our beef because we dont have any beef anymore
3136713 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3136714 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3136715 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3136716 i dont know how much else youre going to learn about these things
3136717 were about maxed out in everything that we have been able to learn about them its all about track position
3136718 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3136719 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
3136720 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3136721 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

3136724 she calls or sends something shes so busy and she seems to make time not just for me but for everybody
3136725 i forgive people not because i fell like it or not because i want to or feel that they deserve it i forgive people because that is what god wants me to do and i forgive because it keeps satan from having any advantage over me
3136726 i forgive people not because i fell like it or not because i want to or feel that they deserve it i forgive people because that is what god wants me to do and i forgive because it keeps satan from having any advantage over me
3136727 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

3136729 i have just been informed by the archbishop of acapulco mexico that a man named martin davila gandara is operating within the diocese of dallas as a catholic bishop but indeed is not a roman catholic bishop nor is he in communion with the roman catholic church
3136730 perform sacraments such as baptisms first communions and confirmations for a charge of 100 to 200
3136731 people should beware of anyone who performs a celebration of sacraments that is not in one of our parishes roman catholic sacraments are administered in the parish also our priests do not charge for sacraments
3136732 there are a whole host of sex traffickers who specifically prey on children
3136733 in the last few years and due to the advent of the google
3136734 and the result and the end game of this operation of russian troops is to commit ethnic cleansing and the annihilation of the ethnic georgian population in the entire abkhazia
3136735 i want to appeal to the worlds present consciousness can one in the eyes of todays world say openly and cynically those lies and can one still hesitate and so oh you know maybe we should think who is at fault and who is doing what and who started and who responded it is so clear whats happening we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3136736 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
3136737 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3136738 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3136739 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3136740 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3136741 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3136742 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3136743 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3136744 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3136745 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3136746 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3136747 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3136748 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3136749 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3136750 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3136751 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3136752 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3136753 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3136754 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3136755 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3136765 i just dont understand why the police took my sons life

3136768 i cant tell you what they were doing we dont even know how many teenagers there were
3136769 we were six guys and two girls we approached but we didnt touch them
3136770 at one point the group began to move and a good number of individuals charged toward the police and threatened them
3136771 one of the police officers present then fired in the direction of the suspects striking three of them
3136772 we want to know whether this is standard police technique

3136975 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3136976 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3136977 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them

3136995 thank god the russians have come it is getting better
3136996 what they wanted to see was an immediate ceasefire and see a mediation effort put in place to resolve the conflict
3136997 they also talked about the need to end attacks and casualties of civilians
3136998 they are going to have some discussions over how to set up this mediation mechanism
3136999 we are calling on the russians to accept international mediation
3137000 we have an agreement with the georgians to help move their troops out of iraq back to georgia i dont see that we are a part of this conflict what we are doing now is calling on the russians to stop their aggression

3137004 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years

3137009 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3137015 making sure not to add too much information or contrasting detail that would break up the strength of the shapes
3137016 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place
3137017 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3137018 when i look at a setup or a composition the first thing i see is a bunch of shapes and values and how they relate to one another
3137019 in the beginning stages im working very abstractly and just thinking about getting the correct placement and proportions of shapes and values
3137020 right now im more interested in the transition of light and its presence in each area of the form than i am in edges and details
3137021 i will work on those aspects in the later stages of the painting
3137022 i dont like to commit until the end of a painting
3137023 i work very slowly and organically in the beginning stages and just kind of feel my way through the process until im sure that ive not only captured the subject as accurately as possible but also made a statement about what ive observed
3137024 my husband and i enjoy hiking and being in nature and i felt challenged by the idea of responding directly to the landscape with oil
3137025 four years ago i participated in a workshop with michael albrechtsen at the scottsdale artists school and traveled to sedona arizona to study with william scott jennings those experiences helped me redirect my studio work toward oil paintings and when we moved into a new home with a large studio space it became possible to work with the solvent based paints
3137026 i learned early on that sticking to the same palette of colors and the same arrangement of those colors is very helpful in plein air painting
3137027 the less time i have to spend locating the ultramarine blue or the cadmium yellow for example the more time i have for painting and using the same reasoning its better to know how i can mix a wide range of colors and values from a limited selection of tube colors than to bother with four or five yellows reds and blues
3137028 its very easy to become absorbed in the excitement of painting outdoors and lose track of why i chose a scene and what i want viewers to recognize as the center of interest
3137029 i constantly remind myself what needs to be the most important part of the picture and how i can direct viewers to that area
3137030 getting viewers to notice the focal point is only half the challenge of composing a picture
3137031 the other half is directing their eyes from that center to the other important sections of the painting i dont want to leave the viewer stuck in the center but rather i want to lead them around and through the rest of the composition this can be done by carrying a line from the focal area toward another location or just repeating colors and patterns that link each section of the composition
3137032 when you think about how landscapes actually register in our minds you realize that we take in a general impression of what we see and one or two important elements of the scene not every single detail
3137033 it makes sense for artists to paint their pictures in much the same way
3137034 keep in mind that the point of this demonstration was to create a sketch not a finished painting
3137035 i kept things simple because i just wanted information i could take back to my studio if at some point in the future i want to use the sketch as the basis of a large painting i will be able to remember the scene or i will know how to make up details that would fit logically into the picture once artists have spent two or three hours staring at a scene and recording it in an oil sketch they can usually recall everything they saw and felt at that moment its really quite amazing but i can look at a sketch i did two years ago and immediately recall the weather the sounds around me and the colors i mixed in each area of the painting
3137036 starting with the demonstration on the first morning i let students know this will be more fun than they expect and less stressful than they anticipate
3137037 most of the participants in a workshop are very successful in their chosen careers and are willing to push themselves to enter a whole new field they just need instruction and direction
3137038 i try to convince them from the very beginning that no matter how experienced or inexperienced they may be they will have fun and take home a lot of useful information
3137039 i can always hear a couple of students take a deep breath when i say the word critique so i quickly assure them they have nothing to fear
3137040 ive heard horror stories about instructors who deflate students enthusiasm with harsh criticism so i make sure to point out that my approach is to help them identify their personal strengths as well as the challenges they are capable of handling the workshop is not about showing off or feeling hopeless its all about enjoying the extraordinary experience of painting
3137041 i have experience teaching portrait still life and landscape painting and love sharing information about developing those kinds of pictures in watercolor or oil but most of my workshops are now a combination of outdoor and studio instruction in painting landscapes in oil
3137042 the best circumstance is when the students and i have five days together in a location that completely removes us from our work and family obligations but of course it is sometimes necessary to shorten the program to three days and to accept that people will be commuting from home whatever the circumstances i try to prepare students in advance by sending them a list of recommended supplies but i assure them they can bring whatever they want and ill find time to help them
3137043 i try to read the expressions on the faces of the participants so i learn as much as i can about their needs
3137044 that way each presentation can be focused on the issues of greatest concern to them for example if they dont understand color temperature center of interest or relative value i show them what those terms mean and how to use the concepts as they develop paintings if on the other hand they are ready to introduce figures into their landscapes or want to capture the angular warm light at the end of the day then i demonstrate techniques for accomplishing those goals i always point out what works and why it works so they understand how to apply the knowledge to their own work
3137045 although i have always enjoyed working with skilled artists because they are generally very driven in some ways the most interesting groups to teach include students who have no background in art because they often work the hardest for every piece of knowledge they can acquire
3137046 they are so excited by the magic of making swirls of paint look like trees buildings distant mountains or reflections in water its such a revelation to them and its exciting for me to offer the skills needed to accomplish that visual communication
3137047 the biggest struggles for most students relate to the concept of color intensity and the specific ways they can vary the degrees of intensity to create better paintings
3137048 much of what they have been taught is inadequate or wrong or else they look at parts of the subject in isolation and lose the ability to see shapes values and colors in context
3137049 to help students understand exactly what i mean i ask them to form a shape the size of a 2b eraser with their thumb and forefinger
3137050 their tendency is to arrange the elements of a still life portrait or landscape in the same way they would if taking a photograph of people at a wedding
3137051 finally the issue of paint quality can be a problem for students who arent accustomed to working in oil
3137052 for example watercolorists have a tendency to thin oil colors with too much solvent and they wind up not being able to control the washes of paint i demonstrate why it is advantageous to work from lean to fat colors without thinning the paints with so much solvent that it wont accept subsequent layers solvent is used to break down paint whereas medium thins the paint without making it run
3137053 but just as there can be a problem with paint that is too thin one can also struggle with thick paint i also show students why it makes sense to sketch in the outline of the shapes in the composition with a thin layer of cerulean blue the weakest pigment on their palette so the subsequent layers of color wont be distorted i find that to be a much better technique than drawing with charcoal or a strong earth color such as burnt sienna
3137054 i dont display my paintings in the studio and i try to avoid painting on other peoples canvases because i want them to find the solutions that are best for them
3137055 i try to steer them in a direction that will allow them to feel they have achieved success on their own that makes it easier for them to solve problems long after the workshop is over if all they learn is how i resolved an issue for them they are less likely to figure things out by themselves
3137056 i assure them the aim is to point out their strengths and opportunities not to destroy their confidence by hammering them with negative criticisms
3137057 we start out congratulating each other on having completed a great day of painting and i enumerate suggestions for enhancing that experience during the remaining days of the workshop
3137058 we also address topics that may not have been covered during the painting demonstrations
3137059 another feature is the opportunity to see everyones work displayed together
3137060 most of the time we paint alone in a spare bedroom studio or outdoors and we have to motivate ourselves to keep working
3137061 i try to give workshop participants as much information and self confidence as i can because they will need a large measure of both to face the isolation and the self criticism i know i always leave workshops excited about the possibilities in front of me and i do everything i can to help the students return home with the same sense of excitement
3137062 im going to demonstrate how to mix and apply oil colors judge the relationship among those various mixtures and use the mixed range of values to paint a still life of simple objects
3137063 after that 60 to 90 minute demonstration well take a short break and then you will have the opportunity to mix black and white oil color and paint a value scale
3137064 but it always helps to review the basic concepts governing anything we do ive been painting for decades but i still have to evaluate the relative value of the shapes im painting whether you are hearing this information for the first time or the 20th its important to listen carefully and watch how i demonstrate the concepts
3137065 the best way to look at relative value is to paint objects of varying shades of gray and white rather than the colored objects you can see in the storage cabinet
3137066 ive chosen objects that allow me to address the issue of scale and ive aimed a spotlight to the left and above the objects so there is a distinction between the highlights and shadows all these arrangements will help you evaluate the simplest aspects of relative value and simultaneous contrast
3137067 if one of these objects blocks the light hitting another then it casts a shadow
3137068 if one is taller shorter fatter or skinnier than the others then i have to paint them in a way that maintains those relationships thats what i think about when im deciding which shapes to put together and where to place them in front of me
3137069 i want to start by mixing a gray that is halfway between white and black you might think that if i combined equal amounts of the two i would get a value right in the middle but can you speculate as to why that approach isnt going to work
3137070 students have a tendency to mix shades of gray that are too dark to indicate an equal progression from white to black
3137071 knowing you might have that tendency i would encourage you to gradually add the black to the white and stop when you have a gray that seems to be halfway between the two
3137072 im simplifying the shapes and only painting a general indication of where one surface is darker or lighter than another in general this is a good way to begin a painting because once the relationship between the large shapes is accurate we can always refine those shapes with more oil paint oil doesnt dry quickly so there is time to add more brushstrokes to refine the individual surfaces finally i use the white paint to indicate the lightest surfaces and sharpen the edges of the shadows by painting alongside them
3137073 when starting a composition it is important to think about the whole page and not individual objects
3137074 address the whole composition using just two tones with an approach that is both conceptual and perceptual working perceptually means working from observation the term perceptual indicates that i will use the middle value and white to establish the composition or arrangement of shapes while thinking of both positive and negative shapes as well as scale and placement the term conceptual refers to the process of deciding what to put in what to leave out and how to compose the picture if these ideas are guided by an idea concept they are easier to make concepts can guide our perceptual decisions in working with tones there are two concepts that are foremost light and volume we ask ourselves what is the direction and strength of the light and how is it defining the volumes in the composition combining the conceptual and the perceptual allows you to make the simplest and most direct statement about volumes they have a light side and a dark side as more tones are introduced to the composition volumes start to assert themselves it is very important to remember that the subject is unified by the light because it hits every part of the composition with the same intensity
3137075 i deliberately kept this painting simple and loose so you could see how i began with an abstract arrangement of shapes now well take a break and come back to practice mixing black and white oil paints to establish a range of five values and well paint those mixtures on a piece of canvas paper to create a chart
3137076 in almost any studio class you take the instructor will ask you to put your work together with everyone elses or they will recommend that you walk around the studio to look at what your fellow students have done thats not because this is a contest to establish winners and losers its because all of us can learn from seeing how other people approach the same process when you participate in this kind of critique as its called the class will talk about your paintings and drawings not about you personally the purpose is to help you look objectively at your work and use that awareness to get better so please remember this when we look at everyones gray scale
3137077 the challenge is to sharpen our ability to make visual judgments about how much darker or lighter one thing is next to another
3137078 as we go through this course the aim will be to improve your ability to make those judgments when you look at something and have to mix paint that matches its relative value next week well expand that to include judgments about the color of the objects we see
3137079 follow the same procedure of mixing the grays on a palette and then apply them with a brush to depict the light midtone and dark shapes that give those objects a dimensional appearance
3137080 or to say it more fully answer the questions what is the color how do i mix the right color what is the right shape where does that shape go
3137081 the trees and bushes in front of the larger trees could be lighter they are getting more light from the sky
3137082 and the trees in the back would benefit from more variety and punch she minimized the lower part of the right mountain probably a good and logical thing although i wouldnt have done it
3137083 the artist has a nice soft touch and im enjoying the lack of definition
3137084 the close greens could be a little richer a little more saturated in the foreground nice variety of edges the addition of a few rocks or details in the foreground should help
3137085 the right side where the sand meets the water is well done but the area on the left where the rock meets the water should be darker as it is wet
3137086 also the water and sandy beach are equal in size the artist should decide which element is more interesting and make that bigger the artist should also pay close attention to edges where the terrain is rolling the edge is soft an abrupt edge is a sharp one and its better to soften the edges of distant mountains where they meet the sky
3137087 even though she broke up her treeline it still reads as a triangle and could be more interesting
3137088 the treeline could use a more sensitive line one that moves usually natures lines are random also remember that trees are as much horizontal as they are vertical sometimes a horizontal stroke is best to suggest a tree nice coloring on the left bank in the center of the painting the depiction of light is the best thing in this painting
3137089 this artist should have spent more time on drawing to get it more accurately rendered
3137090 again the trees are as big as the mountains which is counterproductive this painting also needs something to keep the viewer from sailing off the right side of canvas other than the blob on the right the composition is too heavy on the left side there needs to be more of the influence of the dark trees via reflections on the water the artist needs to vary the line along the tops of trees and the trees on the left are too tall keep in mind that when theres not enough sky in the composition it can look like you ran out of canvas my guess is the artist started at the bottom when the frame goes on this the mountain peak will be crowded by the frame
3137091 remember that every shape in a painting should be interesting there are a few in here that could be more interesting
3137092 also one should avoid having dark areas on the edges of the canvas it makes viewers feel like they are behind bars theres a dark band across most of the painting that is too much the same all the way across finally to have trees as tall as the mountains contradicts what you have to say its usually best to make the trees smaller than they may appear so the mountains seem bigger
3137093 never mix a drab gray grays should always be at least pinkish or bluish nature very rarely makes neutral grays sometimes in the middle of winter youll see a neutral gray
3137094 most people painting these mountains would mix a green color for the trees at the bottom but its best to just modify the mountain color with a little black that will do it
3137095 so i moved on to adding a warm and a cool of each color then i added others that seemed like they would save me time and energy
3137096 is this an interesting shape if you cut out that treeline would it be interesting on its own
3137097 theres a difference between a subject and a always a subject but a painting is design color and value and a painting can have nice grays or great color but you have to ask can you cut out any shape on the canvas and enjoy it if so then it is likely to be a successful painting
3137098 if you are painting one of these mountains you are painting a portrait so you had better get it right
3137099 for parts of the ranges you dont have to be too worried they are quite generic
3137100 the rocky parts of the mountains are usually very close to the sky color and the atmosphere between the viewer and the peaks softens the contrast between light and dark considerably
3137101 snow patterns usually define what is going on up there
3137102 the way snow lays in crevices is what makes a mountain convincing and evident in some areas they can be nondescript and not well delineated but most of the time you had better pay close attention to the shape and pattern that is there usually snow patterns are more interesting than what you would make up around here you could cut up the mountain shapes and make beautiful jewelry out of them they are so perfect
3137103 two brushes allow you to do most everything you want to do a size 3 filbert and a size 7 flat
3137104 with these two you have everything the slender width of the size 3 to the fatness of the wide size 7 i can sign my name or add little branches with the size 3 but i dont need to do this much you shouldnt add little tiny trees on the hillside even though you know they are there its like the artist who asked the model what color her eyes are if you cant see it you shouldnt paint it
3137105 theres no reason to be intimidated by various subject matter
3137106 no matter what it is you just have to look at it its nice to know the anatomy of a horse when painting one the bones muscles and all the rest but all you really need to know is what you see
3137107 just remember if you are trying to be accurate the question becomes if i paint i right will it be a good painting
3137108 if its not then there is no point in painting it
3137109 remember that clouds should have a direction they indicate the wind direction
3137110 as harley brown says if you get the value right you can do almost anything with the color
3137111 they understood the lessons better but they needed to hear the same things no matter where students are at the beginning of the workshop i try to move them to a higher ground
3137112 there should never be any sign that you were there
3137113 we had worked 23 labor days in a row it wasnt like it was a day to spend with our family
3137114 i just dont think i can overemphasis the importance of many of these programs and the role they have played in the lives of children and adults in this community
3137115 i hope that painters start by having a good attitude
3137116 decide that youre going to paint a masterpiece or at least a pretty good painting every time
3137117 i couldnt hear that dog splashing in the water or those grasshoppers snapping their wings if i were wearing headphones
3137118 its natural everybody starts out using photo reference but you get the best possible information in front of you when you paint plein air
3137119 once you can break away from using a photo you are free you feel like a bird leaving its nest
3137120 find your spot find the subject focus in and go for it
3137121 dont look around the whole time wondering about other views
3137122 im not trying to put the world in a 16
3137123 just the essence of the area the big shapes can suggest it all students sometimes jump ahead and put in details with a little brush without having a good foundation underneath
3137124 i take painting very seriously even though i am laid back about things
3137125 its a joyful experience but that doesnt mean it isnt serious its a lot of hard work
3137126 the life that begins when light meets form and the two become one is sacred to me
3137127 ive never worried about style or technique or the fads that come and go but try to be consistent with quality with my chosen interpretations of nature and mankind
3137128 an old leaning weathered barn all the textures and character of it appeal to me i grew up around old stuff i drove a team of horses toots and molly when i was younger so all of this is in me
3137129 i enjoy watercolors spontaneous sparkle and flirtatious nature as the paint and water caress the paper surface and the creative process begins and ends and begins again
3137130 you have to try to do your best every day you can never think im going out to paint another disaster today you should say i want to go out there and do my best its all about confidence
3137131 when students are using a variety of media i teach not only watercolor but good painting principles such as values composition textures and rhythm that apply to all artists
3137132 my goal is to nudge each person to the next level of artistic confidence and ability if you learn one or two important lessons from this workshop your energy will have been well spent
3137133 she advanced very quickly in her art career by attending workshops
3137134 susan was constantly pushing the envelope trying new things thats the kind of environment we try to have here at the workshops the intent is to give professionals a place to get together and be students themselves its not just to learn from instructors but from peers

3137146 no theological grounds for condemning or prohibiting marriage between consenting adults merely because of racial origin
3137147 laws which prohibit inhibit or hamper marriage or cohabitation between persons because of different races religions or national origins should be nullified or repealed
3137148 as such she is prohibited from marrying a negro or any descendant of a negro a mongolian or an indian a malay or a hindu or any descendants of any of them likewise as a descendant of a negro she is prohibited from marrying a caucasian or a descendant of a caucasian
3137149 under the facts presented the appellant does not have the benefit of assailing the validity of the statute
3137150 there was a 448 per cent increase in the number of interracial marriages
3137151 if the only arguments against same sex marriage are sectarian then opposing the legalization of same sex marriage is invidious in a fashion no different from supporting anti miscegenation laws
3137152 one of the arguments for the allowances is youre never not a public figure any more you are always a public figure once youve been prime minister and or governor general that carries with it certain responsibilities

3137155 were trying to get better at recording what we see rather than what we know
3137156 we have to avoid the tendency to automatically act on our preconceived notions or the formulas that worked for us in the past
3137157 for example we know a head is covered with thousands of individual strands of hair at least when we are young
3137158 but when we paint a head we have to see the pattern of shapes each of which is a different value depending on the color form and texture of the hair as revealed by the light we start with the biggest of those shapes and then break them down into progressively smaller shapes but not thin lines similarly if someone taught us how to mix a standard flesh color we have to be willing to adjust it if a face is in shadow if its illuminated by a warm or cool light or if another color is being reflected onto the face from a scarf blouse or jacket the challenge is to respond to what we actually see not what we think we might be seeing
3137159 in the limited time we have over the next five mornings the most we can accomplish is to paint two studies of heads
3137160 in this instance you shouldnt even be concerned about painting a portrait likeness of the model although the more accurately you record what you observe the more likely it will be that one could recognize the model the point really is to learn an approach to developing the form of her head by concentrating on relative value and color temperature as indicated by the light if you can grasp that then you can later apply the same principles to painting the entire figure
3137161 i use the same array of colors each time i paint but i never premix the colors because i dont want to fall into the trap of following a formula
3137162 for the first demonstration i wont use any artificial lights or special props so i can show you a simple process of painting a model sitting under the cool north light coming through the skylights for the second demonstration well start on wednesday im going to shine a warm light on the models face but pose her in such a way that part of her face will be in shadow i want you to see how the values and color mixtures can be adjusted in order to convey that sense of light in a painting
3137163 like most realist painters i use photographs to supplement the drawings and paintings i create from life
3137164 in the case of these large paintings i needed to determine how to put together large groups of figures with a variety of poses and a believable scale for each of the people in the crowd however if you saw the photographs i took on the streets of new york you would understand that random photographs have only limited use in putting people together in a painting although they do help in choreographing the figures into believable positions and they provide the kind of information about lighting textures and backgrounds that is hard to imagine photographs tend to be flat and generalized i had to use them to suggest poses for the models i hired to come to my studio
3137165 i was obviously told what the action had to be in order to convey a story or sell a book
3137166 i would then hire attractive models to take poses photograph them and create the painting using the same techniques im going to be showing you
3137167 i never studied with my father in a formal way but obviously i was influenced by him from an early age
3137168 unfortunately he was working during the height of the abstract expressionist movement and didnt have many opportunities to exhibit and sell his paintings he was a portrait painter and accepted a lot of commissions
3137169 my technique is to paint wet in wet by which i mean that i build up the paint from thin to thick and try to complete as much of the painting as i can while the oil colors are still wet
3137170 that will allow for a more fluid manipulation of colors values and edges than would be possible if i were to work on a dry surface
3137171 be careful not to overwork the wet paint or the colors will become dull and gray
3137172 lay the strokes of paint on the panel and leave them alone until you determine where you need to blend and soften edges the paint will gel better when its wet and fresh if you manipulate it too much with a soft brush the paint will start to look flat dull and spotty this is one of the techniques you will need to practice after the workshop is over because it will take some time to develop a solid wet in wet painting technique
3137173 in most cases i was correcting problems with the drawing or adjusting the composition of values
3137174 its always hard to see our own work objectively enough to know when the drawing of shapes and edges is not accurate or when we arent seeing the balance of light and dark shapes correctly we have to step back and think about the abstract relationships between forms rather than the representation of literal facial features its the old problem of making ourselves see forms not features

3137180 weve uncovered a key ingredient in the birth of hurricanes
3137181 we call it a marsupial pouch because its like a mother kangaroos pouch that provides a nurturing environment for the storm and gets it to the point where it gains enough strength to jump out of the pouch
3137182 it makes some sense from a forecasters point of view
3137183 el apoyo que han recibido los prefectos traduce un mensaje que los prefectos con su proyecto auton mico y el gobierno con la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado tenemos que construir ese pacto de unidad nacional
3137184 creo que debemos cerrar r pidamente este conflicto latente en aras de la tranquilidad de los bolivianos de combatir la zozobra y lograr la armonizaci n de nuestros desacuerdos

3137189 the bill calls for the enactment of an inclusive emoloyment discrimination bill and an end to dont ask dont tell
3137190 the platform addresses many of our communitys critical issues however it does not explicitly use the words gay lesbian bisexual and transgender
3137191 while this has prompted much discussion it is our responsibility as a community in this election year to compare this document with the soon to be adopted republican platform and to judge which party would best advocate for us additionally we challenge the republican party to for the first time adopt equally supportive language
3137192 firmly advocates that all who are qualified be allowed to serve in the military without regard to their sexual orientation this is a bold and historic moment for all those who must serve in silence today and for all who believe in equality
3137193 it has nothing to with real life nothing to do with justice its politics and politicians
3137194 this is more of a kick at the mayor by the governor
3137195 all this talk about police not able to control violence is a pissing match between the powers above us
3137196 yes i know chicago is chicago and its a big city and mayor daley is the mayor there but im the governor of all of illinois
3137197 when communities are being dominated by gangbangers i think we have a responsibility to be as helpful as we can
3137198 youd have to strip some section of the state bare to provide enough state police to make any sort of impact
3137199 and its not like there are 200 300 sitting around a barracks somewhere waiting to get a call
3137200 if the idea was there is a need for more police theyd hire more chicago police officers
3137201 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change

3137207 the imposition of multiple taxes on adult material will likely result in less in state production and more internet based purchases from out of state businesses where collection of use taxes is more problematic these developments would result in an unknown but potentially significant reduction in gf general fund sales and income taxes
3137208 r equires that a business with more than 50 of its gross receipts from adult material pay an 8 3 tax on all of its gross receipts including those attributable to non adult material
3137209 i mposes an 8 3 tax on the gross receipts of businesses involved in the production post production and distribution of adult material
3137210 opponents of the bill question the constitutionality of the measure and dispute the basic premise of the author regarding ill effects of the adult entertainment industry they claim that numerous studies indicate that there are no substantial negative secondary effects caused by adult businesses
3137211 a lot of times common colds are viral and dont require antibiotics and thats why we recommend that when a child gets a cold parents should go to their nearest health center
3137212 parents should not self medicate because it is not necessary and are wasting money in vain
3137213 we always recommend that a child be taken to a health establishment when he she has a respiratory problem
3137214 when the gap starts to narrow on the cost shift the former sad 5 will be receiving programs they pay for
3137215 so the towns wont pay for something theyre not receiving
3137216 one would expect that over time all six towns will be receiving the same types of services within the budget
3137217 so we had to come to some sort of agreement or compromise
3137218 there is a mandate in the plan for the regional school unit to evaluate whether or not the cost shift formulas are working correctly
3137219 will undertake a methodical detailed and comprehensive analysis to project such transition costs and long term savings
3137220 anticipates that the start up costs including the cost of financial audits legal services and systems reconciliation will offset any initial cost savings

3137244 the man doesnt assume that because something good or bad happens that similar consequences will follow it might be good or bad in the moment but no one knows what will happen later because of it when you look back on failures or bad luck you cant ever claim with perfect accuracy that your life would be better had the past been something other than what it is you can only state that your life would be different whether it would be better or worse is something youll never know

3137254 crushing blow not to see his name in the list but badri was not ready to miss training but he looked drained out
3137255 for the first time in my life im feeling that im training out of duty
3137256 forget emerging nations trophy i have scored heavily during the a series against australia and south africa earlier and the only player to have done better than me in domestic competitions is gautam gambhir the india a captain pointed out
3137257 when manoj tiwary went to australia i was intrigued still i tried to keep my cool now its virat kohli this is really going nowhere badrinath fumed
3137258 even today i was there in front of the tv with my wife waiting for the team to be announced i was numb when they finished reading the names he said
3137259 i dont know what badrinath has told the media but i cant discuss the outcome of the selection meeting with the press because it is confidential and not for the public
3137260 forget about the performance during the emerging players tournament even before that i scored heavily during india a series against australia and south africa and the only player to have done better than me in domestic competition was gautam gambhir
3137261 it baffled me when manoj tiwary went to australia but still i kept my cool now it is virat kohli this is really going nowhere none of the selectors have told me where i stand they should allow me to fail by picking me in the side if i am unable to prove my worth i will be a fringe player all my life
3137262 i have more self belief now if i break into the eleven during the odi series in sri lanka i should do well

3137285 the goal of our program is to make the ncaa tournament
3137286 in order to do that we need to win our conference tournament we have won the conferences regular season title the past two years which is a great accomplishment but we are ready to take the next step to try to prove ourselves among the nations elite teams
3137287 i have come into a fortunate situation with seven very talented seniors
3137288 they know nothing less than winning in their first three years they have won no less than 13 games each season and that is a great accomplishment they are so hungry to get to the next level and they want to leave their alma mater as the first class to go to the ncaa tournament
3137289 our style is going to be defense oriented attack minded soccer
3137290 if you are not getting scored on you are not going to lose many games at the same time you have to score goals our team is focused on doing whatever it takes to find the back of the net we are concerned more about how the team does than any individual glory
3137291 emily and jacki are going to be key for us this year in getting the attack going
3137292 they were very good in the spring and molded to the new system i brought in very well schumacker and bailey decker are also going to be able to contribute at the forward position this season
3137293 one of the keys to a strong team is to have a strong central midfield and i believe we have one of the best in the conference
3137294 we have a defending and attacking central midfielder in annie and katelyn they are two inter changeable parts as each can play either position they have a green light to be creative and have a great chemistry together
3137295 on the outside megan is going to be huge for us and sarah schumacker will probably play more midfield than forward
3137296 they give us an added dimension on the outside with their speed and athletic ability christine will help contribute in that area as well while sarah orisich will give us depth technically also patti hoeg is in the mix and will give us added depth
3137297 each year you have losses but you cant replace a player with a player
3137298 i think caitlin kristina cortney and meg mellott have stepped up this spring and will be crucial to our success this year
3137299 we already have an anchor in the back with jen and we will look to build on that and develop chemistry throughout the back line
3137300 as a former goalkeeper i feel it is necessary to have depth in the goalkeeping position
3137301 rachael has been trained very well and has performed at a high level here at ball state the past couple of years i look for her to have a really strong senior year amy has really come on in the spring and has proven her worth as a goalkeeper while alexa coming in as a freshman is so athletic and strong
3137302 we always want to bring in quality over quantity we have brought in eight players that will give us quality depth throughout the lineup the type of depth championship teams need throughout the season

3137306 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3137307 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3137308 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3137309 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3137310 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3137311 overall the playstation 3 outputs visuals that are either on par with the xbox 360 or only slightly behind
3137312 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3137313 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3137314 virginia is still fundamentally a republican leaning state it still hasnt changed too much despite the growth in northern virginia and i dont think obama has any better than a 50 50 chance of winning the state
3137315 i think peoples expectations got too high because they began to believe that these prices couldnt drop and almost the beginning of bubble mentality had taken place over the last year or so
3137316 no one knows how far prices will drop but the fact the world economy is slowing is finally getting recognized in the marketplace
3137317 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year

3137358 well i kept thinking are we going to go to one of those strip joints up there over on philips
3137359 wed known each other a whole month six weeks before getting married we met on a blind date and six weeks later we were married
3137360 we are continuing in our efforts to streamline operations improve efficiencies and reduce costs as well as to explore new strategic initiatives in order to increase profitability and shareholder value during the past quarter we have discontinued several unprofitable ventures settled the irs dispute and made changes that should result in a leaner and more responsive operation
3137361 we are very excited about the opportunities and prospects afforded by the merger of model and e com
3137362 the merger will enable us to pursue future growth strategies take advantage of the synergies between the two companies and position ourselves as a large independent national vertically integrated specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of designer perfumes and fragrances

3137365 the surgery was very successful in lining up the fractures and repairing the nail bed
3137366 not to use too much of a pun but i think we probably hit a home run putting it back together considering what the doctors said in cincinnati
3137367 im so happy and calm now in your heart you feel its all going to be fine but until they tell you its over youre not calm
3137368 he didnt seem scared or apprehensive of course hes a little drowsy but he seems just fine we were real happy
3137369 this was the first option the best option for him

3137462 a feasibility level metallurgical and environmental testing program on the cumo project

3137468 these professionals continue our momentum in building a world class forensic accounting and investigation practice and give us a stronger presence in the strategic new york and texas markets
3137469 their addition further positions lecg to take on large scale forensic investigations and litigation assignments tied to the credit crisis and ongoing wave of sub prime related litigation

3137472 we know that many of our competitors were pursuing this team for their outstanding investigative and analytical skills and experience
3137473 we are gratified that they decided to join lecg and lend their collective expertise to our finance and accounting services practice
3137474 its true that many of us have worked with a number of lecg professionals from our prior days at big 4 and other consulting firms so there was an automatic comfort level of reuniting with former colleagues whose work and credentials we trust
3137475 more importantly lecg has established itself among the worlds elite litigation consultants and expert services firms with an extraordinary client base among leading law firms corporations government agencies and institutions and associations
3137476 the firm is committed to growing a broad offering of financial advisory services and i hope i speak for all of us in saying we couldnt be happier at the opportunity to help lecg take its fas practice to the next level

3137480 during the second quarter we continued to see our revenues transition from legacy tdm services to data and ip services
3137481 on a year over year basis our data and ip revenues grew over 32 which underscores the strength of xos network and our ability to deliver scalable high performance network services for our customers
3137482 the completion of this financing gives us the financial strength and flexibility that we need in order to support fast growing areas of our businesses
3137483 at a time when the capital markets have tightened dramatically we have strengthened our balance sheet and have significant cash available which positions us to pursue opportunities that create value for our shareholders

3137494 market conditions for jones act petroleum product tankers remained very challenging in the second quarter of 2008 although our chemical business recovered somewhat in may and june following a weak april the effects of record high oil prices on both refining activity and consumption of refined products caused a sharp drop in spot market demand for tanker transportation in our core market persistent record prices for fuel consumed to power our vessels also contributed to pressure on operating margins for those units primarily trading in the spot market in response to the drop in spot market demand the partnership has redeployed three of its six itbs into carrying grain for humanitarian organizations under a u s government financed program where demand has been reasonably strong however given continued microeconomic stresses on the us economy and unprecedented crude oil prices our outlook for 2008 remains very guarded

3137581 wii sell through should increase dramatically during the summer due to higher manufacturing capacity coming online during the last month
3137582 between april 2007 and march 2008 nintendo manufactured 1 8 million wiis per month shipping an average of only 600 000 per month to the u s the company announced its intention to ship 25 million wiis this fiscal year implying its intent to increase monthly production to around 2 4 million in july because the u s has received only around 1 3 of total wii production to date instead of a more normal 40 there has been a severe shortage of wii supply here that has yet to let up we saw the shortage relax somewhat in april with 714 000 units sold through 675 000 in may and 667 000 in june we expect the monthly figure to increase once the company is able to deploy its recent production increase to the u s and we expect monthly sell through to increase by as many as 300 000 units per month beginning in august
3137583 in our view u s supply last year should have been somewhere between 720 000 900 000 units per month 40 50 of total units produced but nintendo chose instead to divert a significant portion of its available supply to europe since april 2007 as the weak dollar has made u s sales less profitable for the company than european sales it appears that european console supply has caught up with demand while at the same time the u s dollar has appreciated slightly against the yen making shipments to the u s far more likely going forward as a result we think that the company likely shipped the u s a figure closer to its fair share in the month of july and we expect a further increase in wii supply beginning in august

3137594 londons telegraph newspaper reports that some of the fireworks which appeared over beijing during the television broadcast of the olympic opening ceremony were actually computer generated but hold on its not necessarily as bad as you think the faked fireworks were actually set off at the stadium but because of potential dangers in filming the display live from a helicopter viewers at home were shown a pre recorded computer generated shot it sounds dishonest but im not sure its such a terrible thing

3137661 in the end my responsibility to put bread on the table for my family won and i took the job
3137662 the first two weeks with imc changed my whole perception about life i found myself thinking that i was being treated very special
3137663 this program is the greatest dream i have ever realized

3137682 the glorious vision of ezekiel reveals that it is impossible to locate its fulfillment in any past temple or system which israel has known but it must await a future fulfillment after the second advent of christ when the millennium is instituted the sacrificial system is not a reinstituted judaism but the establishment of a new order that has its purpose the remembrance of the work of christ on which all salvation rests the literal fulfillment of ezekiels prophecy will be the means of gods glorification and mans blessing in the millennium

3137729 if i was going to be an assistant coach it wasnt going to be with any other organization to be honest the fact that its ruud gullit makes it possible for me to do this unless it was someone of his stature i probably wouldnt have put myself in the position of being the assistant coach
3137730 well that makes sense even if gullit does well i dont really see him staying in mls hell probably go back to europe at some point and then cobi can step up and in
3137731 thats always the possibility im not writing off anything but i know that my immediate future is to be the assistant coach here id say that it doesnt put me on a different path it opens up another path
3137732 sometimes there are forces behind the scenes the only certainty you have as a coach is that youre going to be sacked
3137733 we are the los angeles galaxy we are going to attract attention i think that was one of the points that was made clear you need to be able to perform under pressure thats something that i think all the players that are in there need to learn but it shouldnt be stressful you should relish that i did i loved it

3137740 griffit is a player that has been recommended to me he is a very positive lad
3137741 he likes to run at people plays left right or in behind the striker and is just a good acquisition really
3137742 we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
3137743 i think an august transfer is still a possibility although kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal he is waiting and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it for now we must just wait and see
3137744 one of the most important things is to discover how long hes going to be out for we saw on saturday what kind of difference sodje makes to the team
3137745 any length of time will be detrimental to the team so we need to find out as quickly as possible so we can adjust
3137746 im not looking forward to finding out the news because i dont believe it will be good news no matter which surgeon he goes to see
3137747 the wolves will be at the door already because of what happened last season
3137748 as ive said before ive been in the championship three years as a manager and won two promotions

3137751 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
3137752 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
3137753 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
3137754 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
3137755 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
3137756 fall will begin mid august and it will be peaking there the end of august and first week of september
3137757 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
3137758 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
3137759 are always the first to sell out the high demand for the last part of august is because of the fall colors
3137760 near the coast is the last place youll find color
3137761 from mid september to late october we see a variation of fall color rolling through from the western upper peninsula to the southeastern portion of the state
3137762 the lakes tend to pop toward the last moment mid to late october
3137763 that makes it look like evening in the middle of the day
3137764 its not uncommon to see trees turning colors sometimes even later than the first week of november
3137765 in the fall the leaves of the tree turn beautiful shades of pink and magenta

3137786 said a democratic congressional aide who spoke on condition of
3137787 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
3137788 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that
3137789 president bush created this problem we would put in place rules so it never happens again

3137800 importantly during the quarter we delivered updated software for the new dell platforms which we believe will commence shipping later this month
3137801 while enterprise customer behavior is difficult to predict we are currently working to continue our revenue growth in q3 versus q2 and are working very hard to convert our expanding base of pilot customers into larger scale deployments we remain optimistic about the positive responses we are getting from our customer interactions
3137802 its got all the bug fixes and performance enhancements that youd expect in a service pack but there are just so many new features in the net framework that were bringing to visual studio that we think sp1 is going to drive significant net adoption
3137803 this is a laundry list of things that didnt make it into this release for which theyve had a lot of customer demand since they released the ide
3137804 its exciting to see microsoft not only provide a roll up of performance and bug fixes but also deliver critical additional features that immediately address key customer scenarios
3137805 im happy to see that microsoft is delivering these kinds of features out of band so that we dont have to wait on the next major release i hope microsoft continues this pattern with future service pack releases
3137806 for developers the improvements to the wpf design time experience within visual studio have been greatly anticipated and welcomed
3137807 id recommend updating net framework 3 5 to sp1 just for that reason alone
3137808 most of the developers who have moved to wpf have been very happy with the core developer productivity
3137809 i agree that a lot of the marketing around wpf and a lot of the demos that you see look like eye candy but when the developers start working with whats essentially a declarative programming style around xml they realize that its a fundamentally better way to develop uis and i do believe that its the next generation approach to uis
3137810 id be the last person to recommend moving away from winforms just for the hell of it
3137811 but there are places where richer consumer experiences really matter and thats where wpf comes in
3137812 but user expectations for a rich experience appear to be rising
3137813 a lot of exciting stuff for the asp net space
3137814 the ado net entity framework allows you to have a higher level of abstraction over your data
3137815 so developers can deal with these high level concepts and do more model based programming starting with the database
3137816 it replicates what people like to do with hibernate linq to entities is as close as youre going to get to microsofts orm facility any time soon
3137817 to some extent microsoft is putting in place some real structural underpinnings that will let them do some nice things in the future around model view controller mvc architectures
3137818 when you look at the growing popularity of things like ruby on rails and spring you notice that one of the reasons developers like them so much is that theyre well established mvc architectures that you can program at a metadata level
3137819 and that lets you program against it in a whole new way
3137820 a combination of patterns and libraries that allows data stores to be exposed as a flexible data service
3137821 often in the most interesting application scenarios today youve got your data running on a server somewhere and you need some kind of web service to get at that data from a client machine
3137822 the new ado net data services allows richer and easier access to those services and in a more restful kind of way we can give you direct access to those web services and the platform takes care of the grungy stuff underneath
3137823 weve definitely been working on some of the normal service pack kinds of things in terms of making performance improvements and responding to customer feedback
3137824 but sp1 is about increasing developer productivity and lowering the barrier to good ideas with the net framework
3137825 in some ways were victims of our own success with the net framework
3137826 since the first release in 2001 weve added more features and more value and i think its come a long way but its gotten a little heavy as well
3137827 we think it gives us 80 percent to 90 percent of the features that client developers would want but in a much smaller package
3137828 were starting to see a lot more net projects that wed classify as enterprise scale
3137829 a lot of the features im seeing in sp1 are likely to make it easier for people to deploy net in bigger ways in broader senses in the enterprise
3137830 i guess thats a nice problem to have if youre microsoft
3137831 but this richness of choices is something that can create confusion among developers microsoft needs to continue to support developers to help them make the right choices among all the options they now have
3137832 as you can see from the pmbok guides project scope management process flow diagram this process uses the project charter along with the preliminary project scope statement organizational process assets the enterprise environmental factos and the project management plan to create a project scope management plan
3137833 these vehicles blight the landscape and damage the sea defences
3137834 i cannot understand why the owners of these motor caravans which can cost 20 000 or more are too mean to pay for an overnight stay at one of the many caravan sites nearby one of which is less than a mile away they seem to think that they own the sea front they do not it is a public amenity and not there to be dominated by their ugly camper vans if you want a free holiday go somewhere else
3137835 i will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes
3137836 im not sure what i will be willing to support of not support it depends on the entire package
3137837 we going to have to see what the total package is inga what the governor proposed i am not sure can be characterized as a tax increase
3137838 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of our economic environmental and national security crises were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3137839 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world our economy cannot stand 10 more years of sending 2 billion every 24 hours to foreign countries for oil
3137840 we should tax what we burn not what we earn
3137841 both parties have agreed on mutually agreeable terms to part company
3137842 it is an amicable arrangement and we appreciate and respect the issues that ruud has highlighted with the club and are very grateful for all the hard work he has contributed while with the organization hopefully he has laid the foundations for future success for the los angeles galaxy
3137843 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision i would like to thank the players and the fans for their fantastic support and i wish the la galaxy much success in the future i would now like to spend some time with my family before considering any other position in football
3137844 with rudd moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organization
3137845 our commitment continues to be focused on not only winning the mls cup this and every season but to build a club capable of competing at the international level this decision is the right one for the organization the right one for the players and the right one for our fans we thank alexi for the tremendous hard work and dedication he brought to his job each and every day
3137846 buy side investors have seen a realignment of investor expectations in recent months as wild fluctuations in the market make for a greater focus on transparency and process
3137847 fund managers love volatility because it creates a major opportunity for profit but investors need additional assurances from the buy side in the form of increased reporting of exposures
3137848 the time has come for florida and america to once again bring purpose and focus to the most pressing challenge of our time energy
3137849 ethanol will make up 10 per cent of floridas total fuel supply by 2010 the public service commission will develop a renewable portfolio standard to increase the use of wind solar and other renewable energy and our state is now a leader in advancing the development of a carbon cap and trade programme
3137850 in the past couple years there has been a new wave of interest in transporting natural gas under pressure
3137851 perhaps rather than build a 200 million 10 inch pipeline across the flats from ocean cay and then somehow working around the problems of crossing the tongue of the ocean we should look very carefully at using a pair of small cng tankers
3137852 private bahamian capital can surely very easily do the domestic transport in turn that may mean that bec can negotiate a better price for buying gas f o b free on board ship at ocean cay cng deserves a close look in any event
3137853 the target value of bahamian lng is a lot more impressive than the insignificant storage at the everett terminal in boston it would be nice to trivialise terrorism by indicating that no lng terminal has ever had a catastrophic problem but in world history no skyscraper had ever been taken down by an aircraft prior to the 21st century
3137854 nothing more than public bribery and deceit not only oil but gas prices too are on the increase and are expected to do nothing but rise into the future
3137855 while promising to reduce our carbon emissions at bec aes has conveniently forgotten to mention how many hundreds of thousands of tonnes of greenhouse gases will be spewing into the atmosphere from shipping lng from its source to their proposed facility at ocean cay not to mention the running of the plant itself

3137897 ik heb heinen drie keer de kans gegeven met een concreet bod van een andere koper te komen iedere keer is er weer wat anders wat mij betreft is het voorbij
3137898 dit koppel stond vorig jaar als eerste op mijn verlanglijstje maar omdat beide pr olympische verplichtingen hadden in peking kon dat niet doorgaan want die wedstrijden in peking vielen nagenoeg samen met onze zesdaagse
3137899 direct na de huldiging hebben ze mij laten weten graag weer naar zuidlaren te willen komen omdat ze het hier prima naar de zin hadden nou je hoort nogal eens verhalen van sportmensen die zich niet aan hun woord houden maar deze mannen dus wel dat mag ook wel eens worden gezegd
3137900 maar dat is te doen bovendien zullen we de renners maandagavond niet met een al te zwaar programma belasten
3137901 we hebben de stellige indruk dat er sinds de introductie meer capaciteit is waardoor pati nten hun auto kwijt kunnen op het parkeerterrein maar ik houd nog een slag om de arm want deze week zijn de scholen weer begonnen en is de vakantie bijna ten einde
3137902 we hebben het dan over slagbomen die omhoog gaan als ze naar beneden moeten en omgekeerd maar ook dat technisch malheur lijkt achter de rug verder waren er mensen die het kaartje in de verkeerde gleuf duwden dat leverde ook probleempjes op
3137903 natuurlijk lopen de bezoekers niet direct de polonaise maar het aantal positieve opmerkingen is groter dan het aantal negatieve
3137904 dat kan gaan om mensen die een chemokuur ondergaan of voor de pijnbestrijding naar het lucas komen iedere beslissing is arbitrair maar we hebben de grens gelegd bij bezoekers van de polikliniek gratis en kliniek betalen ook mensen die zich melden op de spoedeisende hulp moeten betalen als ze tenminste hun auto op de parkeerplaats hebben staan

3137920 in just a few hours we didnt launch into deep discussions
3137921 we discussed how economic relations could flourish between us jordan has a key interest and strategic relationship with iraq
3137922 on his part the iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki welcomed his majesty s visit to his country describing it as a progressive positive step that enhances the relations between jordan and iraq on the one hand and a prologue to enhance iraqs relations with the other arab countries

3137933 the attack vector is not new but simply a repeat of dans work to a much higher degree of speed
3137934 add s mathematical difficulty of a brute force attempt essentially making the attack take so long that it would be unreasonable to be successful
3137935 for example if in 20 years that secure credit card transaction you made over the internet was hacked it would be rather useless to the attacker
3137936 by adding more randomization in dns just like with cryptography by the time someone breaks in it would be too late anyway
3137937 so far what polyakov has managed to prove is that in a controlled test with highly powerful systems on a fast network dan kaminskys attack vector window still exists and is about 10 hours in length
3137938 and finally apples move towards a traditional contract based subsidy model has enabled it to shift the economic burden of unlocked phones to the carriers emphasis by tmo in the previous model an unlocked phone meant that apple was not going to share in the highly profitable monthly carrier revenues now a carrier may choose to sell a phone without a contract but apple still gets the same wholesale price for the phone with the subsidy baked in we believe this provides a higher degree of certainty to apples earnings and cash flow stream

3137945 salt sensitivity in children is low and rises with increasing age through adulthood
3137946 during adolescence about 18 percent to 20 percent of adolescents in the general population have the condition however in the study salt sensitivity was present in 37 percent of all low birth weight lbw and in 47 percent of the children who were small for gestational age sga
3137947 these children should be followed for signs of reduced renal function and also for an elevated blood pressure
3137948 theres nearly a 50 percent chance of favorably affecting blood pressure by simply reducing salt intake in children born sga and nearly a 40 percent chance for those born with lbw these individuals can be determined very easily if their family physician just gets data on their births

3138003 because the commander in chief sets the mission charlie thats not the role of the generals now i will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics once ive given them a new mission that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out we will not have permanent bases there once i have provided that mission if they come to me and want to adjust tactics then i will certainly take their recommendations into consideration but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief
3138004 we dont need more spin about how the surge is succeeding
3138005 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse

3138016 hp is missing the boat in smb if hp poured half as much money into making their partner programs easier more accessible and of higher quality they would reach a lot more people than they would with cdw

3138119 we will make adjustments to ensure sustained operations and dont anticipate their departure will result in any significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
3138120 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals

3138263 this is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from alpas illegal activity cited in our lawsuit which details the organized and concerted effort to harm our customers our employees and our performance and is part of the unions ongoing two year campaign to intimidate united into reopening a contract that runs through december 2009

3138331 so if you have a gige lan any trojaned machine can poison your dns during one night

3138333 any dns server with a host based firewall can implement a 100 effective mitigation for the polyakov attack and its possible that an upstream outboard firewall could also be made to do it
3138334 at some point isc will have to put logic like this into bind of course but protecting against the polyakov attack is like synflood protection in that its a rate limit problem

3138367 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis

3138377 i think this study demonstrates that the problem of refractive eyesight errors is on the increase particularly in terms of the amount of nearsightedness in the american population
3138378 no one knows for sure what accounts for this but its a pretty smart hypothesis that the increased amount of near work that were doing as a population may be increasing the incidence of nearsightedness and it does suggest that we should be looking into ways to deal with it
3138379 i would hazard to suggest that in general the widespread prevalence of refractive issues today could be related to environmental factors like extensive use of tv and computers and among the young video games because today we get much heavier loads on our eyes from all of that and those are strenuous activities for our vision
3138380 studies have shown that when used in combination with optimal medical therapy crt is associated with a 50 percent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure and a 36 percent reduction in mortality or death
3138381 we did this study to analyze if and how this new therapy is being used in u s hospitals
3138382 thats a small percentage when you consider that we estimate 30 percent to 50 percent of hospitalized patients with heart failure were eligible for crt based on previous studies
3138383 that means that there are a lot of patients who potentially could benefit from the device who arent receiving it
3138384 we also found that 10 percent of patients discharged with a new crt implant had an lvef of greater than 35 percent which suggests that those patients are over treated they have not been shown in trials to benefit from the therapy

3138448 lo que hemos entendido es que ryanair va a anular los billetes de clientes que los adquirieron a trav s de p ginas de internet falsas
3138449 hay que comprobar cu l es la situaci n legal
3138450 es un intermediario por lo que no hay indicios de ilegalidad

3138458 dont try to lie to me i can see right through you
3138459 but it is important yet again to call out the endless neoconservative search for new enemies mini hitlers it is the product of an abstract over intellectualizing of the world the classic defect of ideologues it is as we have seen the last eight years a dangerous way to behave internationally and it has severely damaged our moral authority in the world i mean after the u s invasion of iraq after abu ghraib after our blithe rubbishing of the geneva accords why should anyone listen to us when we criticize the russians for their aggression in the caucasus
3138460 he confirmed this in writing to the swimming federation weve also spoken with the national olympic committee and they have underlined to us that all their athletes compete here in the right spirit against athletes from any nationality
3138461 we take both the athlete and the national olympic committee at their word on this
3138462 the most important starting point is to have the public accurately understand the history and grasp the situation of the ainu
3138463 i want people to know that discrimination is still going on
3138464 the government seriously accepts the historical fact once again that despite being legally equal as japanese people there were many ainu who were discriminated against and forced to live in poverty in the course of the nations modernization
3138465 i would like the members of this panel to come up with proposals that lead to establishment of a comprehensive policy that is necessary for the ainu to hold on to their honor and dignity for generations to come
3138466 public viewing of the documents potentially harms japans relations of trust with the united states
3138467 we requested that the national diet library delist the material from the list of publicly accessible materials because we decided it is not appropriate to make it available as long as it is classified material
3138468 this was a technical mistake and i dont think it was nerves i was a bit too pressed up at the beginning of the dive and didnt have a strong entry
3138469 we have proved ourselves in the past but it just wasnt there today
3138470 im a little disappointed i wanted to win a gold medal today and i didnt i cant explain why
3138471 the creation of a new marketplace is going to be a big step
3138472 but liquidity is a key to developing the right kind of trading marketplace
3138473 the japanese market should be globally competitive and transparent and the liquidity of its trading should grow
3138474 the market must be the place where participants are all able to easily join
3138475 we see significant potential to provide liquidity in the japanese carbon credit market and to help counterparts with managing their combined power fuel emissions weather cross commodity hedging and risk management
3138476 how can i ensure my friend does not starve and do you know of any vegan restaurants in tokyo
3138477 vegans or pure vegetarians eat no foods derived from animals in addition to meat poultry fish eggs dairy and honey they also shun leather silk wool and other animal products people become vegan for various reasons including health ecological and religious concerns compassion for animals and belief in nonviolence
3138478 i only know its a city far from tokyo can you help

3138489 now were focused on the weak demand side of the equation
3138490 there was this thought process that the high price of energy didnt matter to china and other countries but were finding that thats not the case
3138491 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3138492 now were focused on the weak demand side of the equation
3138493 there was this thought process that the high price of energy didnt matter to china and other countries but were finding that thats not the case
3138494 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3138495 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
3138496 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3138497 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3138498 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
3138499 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3138500 my motivation is that smiles cheer up people and bring peace to the world
3138501 surprisingly zhang replied to me by e mail and said this is exactly what we want to do
3138502 i am simply happy my photos are used in such a big event to show what i do to the world
3138503 my philosophy is that if you invest in society two or three times you get one return
3138504 mit 21 prozent der stimmen den zweiten platz hinter den usa die politische stabilit t und die starke technologieszene in deutschland gaben hier den ausschlag
3138505 in our enthusiasm for web 2 0 style tools many blog publishers may forget just how popular sharing by email is its clearly the favorite method email sharing does tend to be one to one however having items shared on digg or facebook has the potential to reach many many more people
3138506 i am very happy to stand at the same position on the podium this time
3138507 you definitely had to bring your a game today to win a medal and those three guys that won they did
3138508 we see world records get broken like its an easy thing but its not
3138509 youve got to take your hat off to someone like that
3138510 in the first half i made myself relaxed tried to swim with big strokes
3138511 i knew that the last five to 10 meters would be the decisive part so in the first part i wanted to keep my energy my race went as i had planned
3138512 this is what i was hoping for and i won with that time
3138513 i tried to swim precisely for each stroke and keep a good rhythm
3138514 my performance was perfect and ideal i would be baffled if you do not say that was perfect
3138515 i had a training period with him two years ago hes great
3138516 i saw him speed off in the first 50 meters but i didnt panic
3138517 i knew that i had the opportunity to get the putt in first
3138518 and that was important i knew if i holed this i probably would win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win the pga so it was down to that
3138519 they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
3138520 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
3138521 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
3138522 i had to convince myself that no its going to be my day and i deserved to win three majors youve got to be very selfish in this situation when youre on the golf course off the golf course you can look at it in a different light but on the golf course youve got to be hard you cant be soft
3138523 1984 was the wolverines worst season in the last 40 years when they finished 6 6 they played byu in a second rate bowl that i thought they should have won byu beat them by a td hardly impressive
3138524 i came across vibeagent while reading a review of it on a blog i cant remember which one my experience so far has been good there is more interaction with other members than on typical travel sites and i like that
3138525 i have used tripadvisor for a few years to look for reviews when booking a hotel but i thought the idea of vibeagents reviews plus social networking would be right up my alley
3138526 participating in the beta stage was interesting with a lot of give and take between those that were running the site and the agents
3138527 because the site is relatively new it doesnt have the depth of older sites but its growing fast
3138528 i especially like the absence of all the commercials found on other travel sites
3138529 the rooms are huge but kind of plain and a little worn
3138530 when the site went public i continued to write reviews
3138531 and i have also used it to plan vacations it has a pretty good search engine for hotel prices and as more people use the site the reviews will become more and more helpful
3138532 we have lots of hoteliers that are building relationships directly with guests and were working on more ways to help facilitate this direct communication
3138533 when you read a review on vibeagent you have a lot of context as to who has written the review you know how they fit in your social network
3138534 you know they are not some jealous hotel competitor or the hotel themselves as happens on some of those other sites vibeagent lets you create a network of trusted friends so you have immediate context as to where they are coming from
3138535 i believe that vibeagent has the potential to become one of the big internet travel sites combining aspects of kayak tripadvisor and facebook at least i hope it does
3138536 efforts to gain as much support as possible for this legislation are being made in order to ensure it becomes a high priority for consideration in next years reauthorization bill

3138540 many women in this age group have already been freed from the chores of bringing up children and have relatively large sums of money at their disposal
3138541 buyers are mostly in their 50s and 60s and some of the women say they reward themselves for their years work by buying our cream

3138543 with expensive foreign brands selling well we cant afford to be complacent but we believe there is still room for sales growth for our high end products
3138544 the defense tonight was ridiculous i mean the guys were making plays all over the place and diving for balls and picking balls
3138545 especially in conditions like this with the wind blowing in
3138546 here it is hit it thats why you have nine guys out on the field who can make plays and some guys make spectacular plays and they did that for me
3138547 thumbs up yall good ol boys simply marbleous whip world

3138557 i have to go back to the hotel i have some washing to do
3138558 they wanted to know who you were i told them you were tourist they asked me where you were from i said england they said they didnt think you should be here
3138559 i cant phone you then we are visiting the boghe ye shah e cheragh shrine and then tomorrow we are catching the bus to yazd
3138560 ooooh that is interesting ok i will go now thank you for talking to me
3138561 i thought americans hate us why would one be here like this
3138562 people and people together no problem but i dont like your president
3138563 because we can do nothing about this traffic we can all say death to traffic
3138564 death to hatred and militarism based on misunderstanding fear and national pride
3138565 what a lovely time im having dying in this van would really put a damper on that
3138566 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3138567 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud i dont think it was working out for him and his family i have no issues with ruud i appreciate what hes done for us and we move on i appreciate cobis stepping in the one guys loyalty and passion over there i dont question is his i think we have eliminated any and all excuses now no one can point any fingers
3138568 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start
3138569 the prepaid offering turned out to be a very popular thing
3138570 its always nice to play the big names especially when you pride yourself on playing well in the big tournaments
3138571 the second rounds extremely early to play nadal hes probably the best player going around at the moment but its a good time to knock him off too
3138572 mathematically no its not impossible but its very hard to turn around the way weve been playing we will get a few troops back next week but it doesnt get any easier
3138573 were disappointed with the result i dont think they gave up trying to be honest with you i thought physically they looked a lot stronger than us
3138574 the game went so quick but it was a dream come true i cant believe im here with all these team mates i just wanted to do everyone proud
3138575 its something ive worked on for years its surreal being here i just want to make my friends and family proud of me
3138576 theyve been good for the past week or so they wanted me to push them around thats my job
3138577 my defence wasnt on par there were a few big boys out there tonight and thats something ill work on my attack was sound i got roughed up before but thats what you expect
3138578 i wish i could have scored that try im back to school tomorrow ive got to start studying for my end of term tests
3138579 failure by parties to abide by the simple procedures may have the result of a petition being invalidated but it is their failure to comply not a mere technicality that causes such a result
3138580 to turn a blind eye toward the blatant disregard of the process and the statutory requirements would divest the voters of the confidence they have in the law and thus would fail to protect the voters in the exercise of his or her franchis
3138581 the decision makes crystal clear that there was a blatant disregard of the process here and this is just a devastating blow to a faltering campaign first johnson didnt get the independence party line now hes lost the working families party line and next hes going to lose this election
3138582 its been a situation that unfortunately we havent brought guys in
3138583 i control what i can control come out every day and get our guys as good as we can im pleased with the top of our roster but we need to add to the bottom of our roster we need more competition
3138584 hes a great guy with talent a good nose for the ball he brings a lot to the game im excited to have him here
3138585 he can cover tight ends play defense play the run so im excited to have him
3138586 just trying to enjoy 100 percent the experience and later try my best on court
3138587 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3138588 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3138589 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3138590 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3138591 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3138592 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mind set
3138593 i was lacking sharpness yesterday and i tried to be more offensive today
3138594 i had a chance with the second set at 5 5 i was on a roll and i am ruing the fact that i let it slip away
3138595 we heard the horn for about a second like this beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
3138596 people lie all the time everyone lies if we chase down and lock up everyone who lied in this country we wouldnt have enough room in the prisons
3138597 not only do i want an elite president i want someone whos embarrassingly superior to me
3138598 but its possible were trying weve one or two options were looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
3138599 it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform

3138604 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3138605 it seems that this will not change anything but will move us away from resolving the situation

3138611 as service provisions a critical aspect of cloud computing grow vendors must become or partner with service providers to deliver their technologies indirectly to users
3138612 user organizations will watch portfolios of owned technologies decline as service portfolios grow the key activity will be to determine which cloud services will be viable and when
3138613 we currently believe this is more likely a 2010 event rather we believe a smaller version of the 13 inch macbook air is likely in the 2009 timeframe

3138617 we conveyed our position on the reinvestigation including what kind of method should be used who should play the main role what should be targeted and how long it should take
3138618 i believe there will be more exchanges with the other side tomorrow
3138619 i repeated that if north korea takes a big step forward we will take a big step forward
3138620 if the step is small ours will be small too
3138621 since the last talks in june bilateral relations have deteriorated further
3138622 the abduction issue is not the only matter between the two countries
3138623 if the two sides do not try to sincerely implement their promises relations will worsen if things stay as they are there will be concern that the talks will end

3138630 every act of creation is first an act of destruction
3138631 he was one of the good ones who came out of here
3138632 its a very proud feeling knowing that someone from here is coming home with the gold it was overwhelming to actually see it
3138633 even if no else was there hed be in there practicing
3138634 watching how passionate he was about it got me into swimming he was a great role model always trying to help someone out
3138635 he was already talking about making the olympics when he got here
3138636 we could tell he had a lot of talent and that he had the drive to do it
3138637 jumping up and down screaming and crying at the same time
3138638 my trip to kenya has been remarkable and has etched memories in my mind that will last forever a few days ago we visited a maasai enkang or village homestead the bright garb and telling faces will cause your heart to beat faster the singing will make you shuffle your feet and some sadness will also enter your soul to gaze into a life so different from mine was very emotional perhaps in many ways the experience was more moving then time spent seeing the strangest animals in amboseli and tsavo national parks
3138639 rob sangster and tim leffel have written the definitive guide to traveling in mexico and central america its a smart roadmap for any south of the border traveler
3138640 maybe not on the surface but women understand the transformational power of travel
3138641 women tend to travel to help them through lifes passages they go when theyve been dumped after a divorce a bout with cancer
3138642 i got over my own mothers death by hiking in the colorado rockies with my girlfriends
3138643 my book doesnt list everything to do in a city
3138644 for a woman its often better to have a meal that is an
3138645 ive visited hiked biked eaten shopped slept you name it in 90 percent of the places in the book and the remaining two spots my sister did
3138646 i dont have an inheritance i do travel on a budget and i do want to share with women what ive learned i want to save them time and money
3138647 women are more independent and confident than theyve been in the past and more of them have the income and the means to travel
3138648 ive got figures that say the average adventure traveler is a 47 year old woman
3138649 women account for 70 percent of the adventure travel industry and its no wonder when you consider that the number of tour operators that are now working exclusively with women has risen 300 percent in the past 10 years and i dont mean gay travel these are women only tours
3138650 weve found that the number one reason women dont travel alone is fear they fear for their safety
3138651 but this is what i find so interesting they cant really say what it is they fear
3138652 womens travel concerns are based on their lack of knowledge part of what i want to do with tango diva and fly solo is to alleviate these insecurities if women have the knowledge they will go
3138653 women tell me they overwhelmed by lonely planet and fodors
3138654 theres so much information its like turning a hose on in your face in fly solo i try to bring it on gently i start each chapter with why i think that place is great include some historical facts and cultural know how then highlight unique places to see
3138655 i want to say to women give me a few days of your life and let me transform it by putting you on a plane
3138656 when you travel alone you dont have someone to buffer you from all the stares all the looks all the comments are directed at you
3138657 we think someone said hi to me i should say hi back but if you do that if you say hello you open yourself up to contact and it snowballs from there thats when the questions start do you have a boyfriend where are you going
3138658 you dont have to engage with everyone you come across
3138659 at home you dont feel this need if youre walking by a construction project in the u s and a man calls out you dont stop to say hello
3138660 the problem is that when you get outside your country when you get outside your comfort zone you lose track of what the rules are and you dont want to be perceived as rude
3138661 and their biggest fear in traveling alone is that they will feel completely isolated
3138662 in reality thats the furthest thing from the truth solo travelers are like magnets they attract one another
3138663 when i travel on my own i become bolder than i normally am i go up and insert myself into tour groups i say im traveling alone can i sit with you people always say yes
3138664 when you step outside of your little box and succeed you realize you can do anything you set your mind to

3138666 the book has done well enough to convince me ive hit upon a market that is underserved

3138670 theyve turned into interactive workshops about how to travel as women
3138671 most of the women were between 40 and 70 years old they were recently divorced or empty nesters they were at transition points
3138672 they wanted to travel but were scared they wanted to know how to take the first step
3138673 it was really touching for me to watch them look around see they were part of this network of women who also want to or already are traveling a lot of them had real breakthroughs realized they really could do this
3138674 they see it as a liberating thing to do and that is really infectious
3138675 dont stay home because you dont have a travel companion because your friends dont have the time money or inclination to go pretend like youre gutsy and just go forth and go there are other women out there i promise
3138676 a language immersion program can be a great experience for a woman who is traveling alone for the first time the school will arrange your room and pick you up at the airport or bus station they fill your morning with classes and plan activities every night like cooking or dance lessons and lots of them have free internet access the school and other students provide a built in community
3138677 if youve never traveled alone take baby steps choose a new restaurant and go out for lunch by yourself take a weekend trip closer to home the key is to step outside your comfort zone and that doesnt have to mean leaving the country a newly divorced woman from iowa might find new york city to be just as foreign as india
3138678 all women should travel to their motherland wherever that is to you it can be deeply moving to be surrounded by people who look like you to learn about the roots that dwell within you

3138785 the aclu of connecticut opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
3138786 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
3138787 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
3138788 such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
3138789 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city

3138796 this is the word of god that im holding in my hand and this is infallible and perfect and theres no contradictions and is scientifically accurate
3138797 oh he hung himself and then the branch broke and he fell off a cliff

3138806 that a democratically elected russian ambassador vitaly churkin repeating the exchange and saying
3138807 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
3138808 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression
3138809 we do not use such an expression but sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
3138810 without the departure of saakashvili it is impossible to stop the conflict in irakli alasania told the council it was

3138813 the danger of radiation is that you cannot see it and the effects emerge subsequently we have to live in fear
3138814 as a person who experienced the atomic bomb in nagasaki i am opposed to anything that produces radiation whether it is nuclear power generation or a nuclear powered aircraft carrier or submarine
3138815 this kind of unforeseeable accident could happen in the future the government should not accept the deployment because anxiety among the people has not been dispelled
3138816 if an accident occurs the whole area around tokyo will be exposed to radiation posing a risk to people for decades
3138817 the united states also does not release information to the japanese government nor can japan check the aircraft carrier
3138818 it is important that japan convey the fear and the accurate information it has regarding radiation
3138819 i dont want such vessels to come near us its sad that the japanese government cant reject it
3138820 it would be wonderful if really secure nuclear power facilities could be established but anxiety and fear will never disappear even if the government says nuclear facilities are 100 percent safe
3138821 if radioactive materials contaminate the environment it cannot be erased with human power we cannot lay our hands on things we cannot clean up
3138822 humans do not have the ability to control nuclear power they cannot exist together
3138823 im alan yeah i just got into an argument with my drunk wife

3138828 it doesnt seem like it will have an immediate impact on the economy
3138829 otherwise fukuda would be criticized for not having any policy it would be a very narrow way for fukuda to go on if he really wants to keep a tight fiscal policy
3138830 the corporation has the expertise and wherewithal to suggest the best alignment and keeps in mind the number of passengers during peak hours and at other times this is because it has to generate the funds for operating the system one has to consider the socio economic and environmental benefits of metro rail accidents too will fall once the system becomes functional in delhi the dmrc has been running feeder buses to and from metro stations for the convenience of passengers there is no doubt about the financial viability of the kochi project

3138832 i am very happy to stand at the same position on the podium this time
3138833 you definitely had to bring your a game today to win a medal and those three guys that won they did
3138834 we see world records get broken like its an easy thing but its not
3138835 youve got to take your hat off to someone like that
3138836 in the first half i made myself relaxed tried to swim with big strokes
3138837 i knew that the last five to 10 meters would be the decisive part so in the first part i wanted to keep my energy my race went as i had planned
3138838 this is what i was hoping for and i won with that time
3138839 i tried to swim precisely for each stroke and keep a good rhythm
3138840 my performance was perfect and ideal i would have been baffled if you do not say that was perfect
3138841 i had a training period with him two years ago hes great
3138842 i saw him speed off in the first 50 meters but i didnt panic
3138843 if everything goes as planned the grading system will start this academic session
3138844 we can become a knowledge society by 2020 only if the talent in every student is identified and nurtured
3138845 said a sheet of snow white paper pure was i created and pure will i remain forever
3138846 and the multi coloured pencils heard her also and they too never came near here and the snow white sheet of paper did remain pure and chaste forever pure and chaste and empty
3138847 it is not in the realm of this court to enforce every panchayat resolution without looking into its substance if the prayer of the petitioner is countenanced that will run counter to article 17 abolition of untouchability of the constitution
3138848 i always knew he would make it i just couldnt control my tears when i saw him i am so proud of him and the way he received the medal he was so composed but i cried so much i could talk to him four hours after his victory he is very happy but as always he was calm
3138849 i have never been happier in my entire life abhinav has done the country proud
3138850 it has been a tale of sweat extreme hard work abhinav bravely fought a career threatening back injury we put him through a commando type of training which has given good result before the training he could not even lift a rifle
3138851 we will be rushing to delhi day after tomorrow to receive him when he returns on thursday but before that we will go to the golden temple in amritsar to pay obeisance for his success
3138852 all the prayers of his friends and well wishers have been answered
3138853 he has beaten the entire world this is bigger than the world cup
3138854 abhinav is a singh and when a singh sets his mind on a goal he achieves it which makes him a king and abhinav indeed is a king
3138855 there usually isnt a solution that can make all the parties happy
3138856 the message has gone out in both srinagar and jammu
3138857 that behaving in completely unreasonable ways gets new delhis attention and with elections around the corner all parties hope to benefit from a communally polarised political landscape
3138858 i just went for it on the last shot it went my way today was my day
3138859 going in fourth i had a poor sighting series thankfully it went my way once the competition started i just focused on each shot
3138860 there is not much i can say you have to be at it
3138861 i thank my parents coaches and everyone for their support
3138862 i was trying to concentrate on shooting well i wasnt thinking about making history being two points behind i had to shoot good my coach asked me to be aggressive and that is what i did
3138863 i sincerely hope that it changes the face of olympic sport in the country
3138864 the force consists of more than 9 000 troops and more than 350 armoured vehicles
3138865 if the ultimatum is rejected all necessary enforcement measures will be used
3138866 russia has historically been a guarantor of security in the caucasus
3138867 we have never been and will never be passive onlookers in the region
3138868 i had to go for it on the last shot today was my day i am happy and thrilled i cant describe it
3138869 despite challenging market conditions we are pleased with our continued efforts to resolve our credit issues and maintain our financial strength

3138871 fell victim to a war between old mentalities and growing civil liberties
3138872 we are trying to raise awareness of gay rights in this country but the more visible we become the more we open ourselves up to this sort of attack
3138873 i award death sentence to both the convicts under section 302 of the indian penal code both the convicts be hanged till death
3138874 if the facts are seen closely it would be found that the gravity of the present case is more than the case before the supreme court in our case the victim was of such an age that she should have been seen by the convicts as a motherly figure committing rape of an old lady shows a mind which is more depraved than dhananjoy chatterjees
3138875 in the present case there is a very high degree of certitude and therefore i am unable to restrain myself from awarding maximum punishment
3138876 all the circumstances have been proved by prosecution and lead to irresistible conclusion that the accused subjected the foreigner to gang rape and killed her after robbing her of valuables
3138877 if i cant remember this you can shove skittles up my vagina
3138878 sport at its best obliterates divisions between peoples such as ostentatious flag waving and exaggerated national sentiment
3138879 family courts will usually do what is easy and giving custody to the japanese parent is usually going to be easier
3138880 whoever has the children when proceedings begin gets sole custody of the children in virtually every case its then easy to understand why parents do such cruel things to each other and the kids to get physical custody before divorce is petitioned for and custody is decided in family court
3138881 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
3138882 oh that would be glenys over here shes a real beauty
3138883 a lot of basic information about the japanese market is never translated over to english and lots of bad information such as the fact that 94 3 percent of japanese women in their 20s own louis vuitton bags is repeated over and over again
3138884 so we felt providing the latest news and information was necessary

3138902 we will make adjustments to ensure sustained operations and dont anticipate their departure will result in any significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
3138903 they were an important and valued partner and contributed quite a bit to the improved security in wassit province where the bulk of their forces operated with us and our iraqi security force partners
3138904 i do not think that the departure of the georgian soldiers will have an impact on the situation in the province
3138905 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3138906 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals
3138907 we want to thank them for the great support theyve given the coalition and we wish them well
3138908 weve adapted quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt the battle space to account for their loss
3138909 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
3138910 i was considering giving up before belgrade and now i have to say im very doubtful about ever wanting to do eurovision again ive had so much fun but i think its time for someone else to take over
3138911 days before the show i knew russia would win the fact is putin was getting nasty which means the former satellite states were always going to vote for russia in order to keep the oil coming
3138912 its unfortunate i suppose but whereas we have always taken eurovision with a pinch of salt the former eastern bloc countries are not sufficiently versed in the ways of democracy to realise they are supposed to be voting for a song not a next door neighbour

3138933 and thats the plan he needs to come back with a vengeance wanting to establish himself as a good football player in this league
3138934 its always been a first round draft pick and trying to overcome injuries
3138935 its been pretty hard but i enjoy the patience the redskins have had and i feel like im ready to go out there and actually show what first round is
3138936 weve seen in the training room and the weight room that desire to get back healthy
3138937 he has definitely overachieved there were very hopeful thats going to carry over
3138938 it adds another very good football player into the mix

3138960 for example if in 20 years that secure credit card transaction you made over the internet was hacked it would be rather useless to the attacker
3138961 by adding more randomization in dns just like with cryptography by the time someone breaks in it would be too late anyway

3138993 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3138994 at the moment our troops are pushing out capturing and disarming groups of georgian law enforcement agencies which have been surrounded in the capital of south ossetia
3138995 the 1992 treaty which georgia signed among others clearly defines the limits of responsibility of the russian peacekeeping contingent and is doesnt have any tasks of invading the georgian territory

3139012 there is something downright wicked in casting the old easy rider as the liberal standard bearer and the sinister figures who run their campaigns the karl rove stand in martin fox stanley tucci and the desperate to win democrat art crumb nathan lane the election itself over in the films first few minutes is a frightening reminder of how divided we are in this country the premise would seem ridiculous if george w bush hadnt lost the popular vote to al gore in 2000 but claimed the white house on the basis of a disputed 500 vote win in florida in swing vote the election comes down to the electoral vote of new mexico where the popular vote is tied with the ballot in one malfunctioning voting machine yet to be counted that ballot belongs to trailer dwelling pickup driving unemployed factory worker bud johnson kevin costner a good ole boy who likes to sleep late and drink hard if buds precious 10 year old daughter molly madeline carroll wasnt a current events whiz bud might not even realize an election is underway he doesnt like voting because he knows it would expose him to the possibility of jury duty but this time vote bud must and with the next occupant of the white house to be determined by one man boone and greenleaf launch a two week campaign directed at bud alone their operatives try to sift out his prejudices and the candidates then adopt whatever position they think might win his vote all played for laughs the pro development republican becomes an environmentalist while the democrat pulls a bush i and abandons choice for right to life this is all at least middling funny theres a nice side bit about bud playing in a willie nelson tribute band brightly called the half nelsons costner has found a nice recent niche playing deadbeats with a cuddly core his performance is much akin to his role in the upside of anger and buds complicated but ultimately loving relationship with molly will recall alan arkins with abigail breslin in little miss sunshine were it not for mollys urgent determination to see her dad as a hero we would have little choice but to judge him an irredeemable lout not a lot of the plot makes much sense bud is practically trapped in his trailer by the howling mob of reporters but when its convenient hes able to move around as he chooses and since bud readily agrees to meet with both candidates their decisions to produce elaborate television commercials seem unnecessary and stupid openly exposing their hypocrisy when it would make much more sense just to lie to bud behind closed doors of course the filmmakers had a ball with those commercials and much of the comedy proceeds from them swing vote gives off a strong whiff of frank capras celebration of small town american individualism buds concluding speech about core american values has a rousing fourth of july spirit but in the end the picture isnt nearly as optimistic as capras where mr smith can go to washington and actually make a difference swing vote tries to fudge this point in the late going but boone and greenleaf are buffoons we dont care which one bud votes for and through the bombast of the end we hear buds opening snarl about the pointlessness of voting because whoever gets elected doesnt change anything
3139013 the quest for establishing a democratic republic of nepal had begun two decades earlier than the kathmandu explosion that was carried out targeting the king and the royal palace of nepal in 1986 the explosion was made possible after a long and meticulous planning
3139014 i taught them the maoists skills to make powerful bombs which were used during the armed struggle
3139015 i am almost certain that the madheshi parties in nepal will find themselves close to the maoists in the days ahead and i hope that the rest of the parties too will cooperate in the process of drafting a new inclusive constitution for the nepali community
3139016 transport fares have not gone up for the past eight years when fuel prices increased many times
3139017 we cant run any vehicles with a mere 25 percent hike in fares
3139018 im not expecting to win but if you dont take action theres no chance to let the outside world know the truth
3139019 its an opportunity to talk about the unfair treatment of tibetans over the years
3139020 she went into unknown territory i think no tibetan had ever spoken out so openly in print or in the media
3139021 when she first started to write about these things i think everyone assumed that her position would be impossible to sustain but she has never faltered the risks she took were off the chart
3139022 there were things in there that were the opposite of what we had been taught
3139023 im an author who writes from home all the time if i really am posing a threat to society doesnt it make the great country of china seem very weak
3139024 its hard to say whether she will win or not
3139025 both woeser and her husband are sensitive figures but no matter who they are they should enjoy their basic rights as citizens
3139026 i still have hope in china which is such a strong nation
3139027 i hope it will be strong enough to give me a little space
3139028 the maoists thought they had a mandate to have both the presidency and the premiership the other parties thought that was concentrating too much power with the maoists i expect within a week or so the maoists will start to form a government they will be under heavy pressure from both the voters and the international community to do so
3139029 it is a nonsense idea to have a single madhesh state because different colors of people live there the madheshi people want their rights not a separate territory
3139030 the politics of consensus can only make our people rich and happy if we unite and make our efforts for developing our small country by utilizing the natural resources and beauty of our country we can be a rich country soon
3139031 nepal itself continues to remain an outsider next to other asian ldcs that have enjoyed higher rates of growth over recent years and are making faster progress in transforming their economies away from a dependence on commodities towards manufacturing and services
3139032 on current trends the report suggests nepal could be more than 50 years away from graduating from the ldc group
3139033 we need a much greater sense of urgency amongst all those responsible to get nepal out of the ldcs club only effective economic policies that create employment increase agricultural productivity and reduce dependence on commodities can ensure that growth when it comes will translate into poverty reduction one third of nepals population continue to live in some of the worst conditions to be found on the planet
3139034 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3139035 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3139036 they can do what they want with it but he doesnt remember anything he remembers nothing before 1993 except for little bits and pieces
3139037 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3139038 people are starting to understand more and more why this is important
3139039 i have all these gamecamp students and these parents who tell me this is exactly what these students need and what they want that motivated me to accelerate what we were doing with 3 d squared and broaden it to be more oriented toward training and education
3139040 they all understand it at some degree what i became aware of is that the programming side of that is a huge breakthrough industry and the question to me was why not louisiana and if louisiana why not lafayette especially when we have a place like the lite center thats a perfect incubator for that
3139041 this is one of the industries about which were most excited as an agency and about which im personally excited as well
3139042 it also involves simulations and military applications this is an industry sector with massive potential an industry sector that as big as it is is still in a lot of ways in its infancy its got years and years of double digit growth ahead of it and i think our state has the potential to be a major player
3139043 the question is not really does the state have the talent the question is does the state have a strategy to do it in a way that makes sense that can compete with the other states that are doing these kinds of things
3139044 were going to be able to tap into his expertise to bring in industry leaders that can help the students here really learn the industry the way that it needs to be learned and that will allow us to help create the workforce to do video game development work in the state long term
3139045 lites mission is to provide access to technologies that companies and individuals dont have the capacity to access on their own whether its the technical artists or our experts in 3 d projection our staff here is going to be part of those things at times to make sure that the business community understands how to get involved and how to learn more
3139046 the video game development industry is bigger and growing dramatically faster than the overall entertainment sector
3139047 and these jobs are high paying permanent positions in contrast to many of our movie productions where they come they shoot but then they leave
3139048 is the development of the workforce thats really the holy grail to making all this happen pulling together a compelling workforce situation for potential video game development companies
3139049 good start toward more efficiently pairing state dollars with state needs
3139050 non governmental organizations to compete for state funding on a level playing field
3139051 joe weise elizabeth eckman heidi klee charles bartley and oliver
3139052 the affair began long long long before she was hired to work for the campaign almost half a year before she was hired to work on those videos
3139053 my sister she obviously made a mistake that doesnt mean shes a bad person to the contrary shes a great person i love her very much
3139054 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3139055 shes not going to tell me i dont love her
3139056 the american society of civil engineers has shown their true colors and that is more of a drive to protect their own than to protect the american people
3139057 as a past president of asce i think they would support that kind of investigation at the drop of a hat
3139058 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
3139059 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
3139060 in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama
3139061 every political party now deploys the language of the advertising executive and the skills of the pop video maker in their election campaigns
3139062 cheap maybe we could use a little of that in washington
3139063 the agreement today will free financial resources for important hurricane protection measures such as the morganza to the gulf larose to golden meadow and important restoration and hurricane protection projects in southwest louisiana
3139064 this announcement marks a significant step in the recovery of this region and our state
3139065 not only do our citizens rightly deserve the flood protection they were promised but just as importantly they deserve this protection in a way that will not financially undermine our state budget
3139066 with less than 100 days to make their case for change to voters in their districts the red to blue program will give these candidates the financial and structural edge to be even more competitive in november
3139067 currently assessing the best path to take to name a successor

3139100 we cant keep them there and no decision has yet been taken about what to do with them
3139101 maybe the livestock department under the ministry of agriculture should use these cows for research purposes
3139102 listen a few years back when it was ultra chic to be pro tibetan and media coverage was huge we had plenty of big name celebrities who came out to march with us and speak on our behalf when the novelty wore off many of them moved on not bob to this day even if theres only a handful of demonstrators who gather in front of the un to commemorate the march 10 1959 uprising in lhasa if theres only five of us and were freezing our butts off and theres no press covering it bob thurman will be right there freezing his ass off alongside the rest of us
3139103 they cant have both the posts of a prime minister and the president at the same time
3139104 we will no longer tolerate criticism as we have already been elected by the people we have become the largest party
3139105 we cannot take this comment lightly by the chairman of that party which is preparing to form the government
3139106 it will be a long time before the change in government results in any concrete economic change for nepal the advent of a republic is not a sign of an economic take off the country is in a state of political and legal flux in terms of bringing an end to civil conflict yes its a positive whether its a positive for the business and investment environment remains to be seen for now we are not expecting any major economic programs to emerge
3139107 independent secular inclusive federal democratic republic with sovereignty and state authority entrusted in the nepali people
3139108 no one really knows what items are there in the palace as it was closed for the public so far
3139109 we have formed a committee to collect the details of all these within 10 days all items will be catalogued so they can be displayed in the museum
3139110 we believe that no contact means just that no contact
3139111 the only thing the magistrate said she wanted was to stay away from the two officers
3139112 its only fair for them the prosecutor to look at it but its nothing if it is what we think it is
3139113 we will be talking to the mayor next week and we expect to resolve this
3139114 she was concerned about mckinney and white her no contact order did not extend to the sister or the epu officers
3139115 we are going to be looking into it to see what travel was approved
3139116 looking like someone opened a bar in an old chinese restaurant
3139117 how could they deliberately and cruelly separate mothers and children and call it good
3139118 how could they not see that they were simply trafficking in the most innocent and vulnerable of us all exploiting them horrifically
3139119 in direct relation to the iraq war its tempting to see henrik ibsens classic
3139120 it could apply to anything from who benefits from city contracts to the use of bogus intelligence to start a war but this play will always be relevant to something and always timely this is the story of how hard it is to be a whistleblower or more accurately how the most predictable reponse to one is an attempt to kill the messenger and does that martyr that person for the cause or does it simply bury the truth the first act of the play sets up the conflict clearly and starkly as the audience surrounds the stockman family dining room on three sides almost close enough to sit at their table donald lewis plays an effusively optimistic and dignified dr stockman who has discovered that the citys great new attraction its baths are not in fact having the advertised healing effect on visitors its a poor town and the recently constructed baths promise to let everyone share in the wealth generated by tourists unfortuantely stockman has treated people for illnesses that he believes are caused by pollution in the water supply serving the baths he believes the solution is to get water from another unpolluted source his brother peter ron reeder is the town mayor so the doctor believes it will be easy to get the town to support the changes but nothing is simple reeder ably handles peters soft spoken and calculating ways the changes will cost a fortune and besides being mayor hes an investor hes skeptical of the health report and not at all eager to throw away all the money already spent on construction and then there are the media representatives of a local paper dine at the doctors table they are eager for the scoop and the mayor goads them as rabble rousers and rebels the doctor believes that the townspeople must be told and the paper is going to run the story until the mayor stops by the publishers office the paper is after all a business if the paper prints the story and the townspeople decide the baths must be fixed that will be expensive and the only way the company could do the peoples will and rebuild the baths would be to levy a tax and let them pay for it the mayor says the papers owners dont want to support a new tax on such an impoverished town the mayor suggests that they might not want to to print the pollution story and risk losing advertisers who just happen to be many of the same businesses and wealthy people who invested in the baths the second act brings in the townspeople or more fairly the mob theyre a loud and unruly bunch under andrew vaughts direction they mill about throughout the play coming and going at the four corners of the stage the compact performance space at the north rampart community center echoes with their disruptions the doctor schedules a lecture
3139121 they are using nepals territory for political purposes and trying to disturb peace and security in our country it is against the law
3139122 theres a huge discrepancy hundreds over a thousand are unaccounted for
3139123 80s the music coming out of new orleans largely sounded like what was happening in the rest of the country a singsongy sugarhill gang style vocal rhythm over fat methodical beats and soul and funk samples
3139124 trick stop talkin that s t and buy your name here his outfit
3139125 oct 21 1998 that was the first time i got on the mic
3139126 and when i got up there everyone knew what to say back
3139127 00s including freedia and later nobby plus artists like vockah redu chev off the ave
3139128 90s but favored lighter cheerier samples than the ominous ubiquitous
3139129 we got to hear that music in the club because thats what makes the females do all types of dances
3139130 you are too stupid for calling us guys you know you tried it so stop telling them lies
3139131 90s and had a hand in the startup of the cash money label
3139132 im not a woman im not a man im bobby marchan
3139133 you know the reunion that starts with big hugs and warm feelings but ends with arguments and hurt feelings cuz somebody says or does something stupid theres the perfect example the panel that was supposed to educate amp enlighten and pay tribute to the only contemporary new orleans originated genre of music and its colorful characters spiraled out of control
3139134 the music has a lot more to it than just the stigma of being gay or transvestite
3139135 90s wave of popularity there was a lull that allowed the sissies style to take over because of their multiple releases and frequent shows
3139136 when we took a break it was left open for them and now its oversaturated with their style of bounce
3139137 work ya elbows the djs act like they dont have any other music to play its nothing against them its just the only thing i hear now in bounce is gay and its something i dont want my children to hear
3139138 but i hear the same complaint that bounce is gay at the barbershop at the studio everywhere i go
3139139 theyre not ok with a man talking about another man ive seen it turn out ugly you know how people are when they dont understand something
3139140 she would march with her hair done and makeup and people would be yelling and even throwing stuff
3139141 wed be interviewing freedia and thered be some guy in the background just heckling
3139142 i asked vockah how is it being a gay rapper
3139143 im still doing my thing in the street on the mic in the club every week
3139144 and theyre hustling and grinding like me so they hot people new to the music might say that bounce is a gay thing but they dont understand and theres no big contract coming through right now so what are you fussing for we all scraping and scrapping if you get mad at that youre not doing your homework
3139145 you have to transform from an old generation to a new generation freedia and nobby are like an upgrade from katey red and theres really not a lot of bounce artists still doing it and eventually ill probably get to a new level with my music too
3139146 what were trying to do now people like us and 5th ward weebie is reinventing bounce
3139147 and that led a lot of people to say to hell with it they took our style but now were gonna look like copycats
3139148 if theres going to be a town where gay rappers are going to break out new orleans would pretty much be the only place in the world that could happen
3139149 in new orleans theyre more accepting to homosexual music theyve got less prejudices
3139150 theyre providing music for a core new orleans audience that wants uplifting party dance music instead of rap that focuses on lyrical development and narrative
3139151 new orleans people want music that keeps the vibe going not a think about lyrics vibe but a party in the street vibe and its still original in the wider context of rap even as it repeats itself it captures the energy down there in new orleans the way nothing else does a joyful energetic living culture
3139152 weve been playing a lot of college campuses a lot more white events
3139153 just because a song dont have a triggerman beat or something doesnt make it not bounce
3139154 in terms of next steps i really wouldnt want to speculate it is going to depend they are on the terrorism list they remain on the list for the moment
3139155 there has been a policy that we had of not making contact with the maoists the fact that nancy powell met them and that i met them should suggest that we have just revised that policy with respect to this group
3139156 the organizations terrorist activity or terrorism must threaten the security of u s nationals or the national security national defense foreign relations or the economic interests of the united states

3139162 we had classes with three students who were on convalescent leave and it was incredibly successful
3139163 dijo un portavoz del kremlin como que los rusos no quieren terminar el conflicto
3139164 the appellate court did not decide anything on the merits
3139165 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3139166 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3139167 the occurrence of plant death was obvious to everyone living in that area
3139168 drought certainly stands out as a real likely explanation it is an extremely severe event
3139169 there is sufficient evidence to prove this incident was organized premeditated and meticulously orchestrated by the dalai clique
3139170 the dalai lama is a jackal in buddhist monks robes and an evil spirit with a human face and the heart of a beast
3139171 we possess ample evidence that the violence has been organized plotted in advance and meticulously orchestrated by the dalai clique
3139172 we the sherpa himalayan community of nepal express our serious concern over the barbaric and repressive behavior of the nepalese government in dealing with the peaceful demonstrations of tibetan refugees here in kathmandu behavior exhibited in the name of
3139173 we are very much worried about those injured both during those peaceful demonstrations and during incarceration afterwards these abuses are very serious violations of the interim constitution of nepal which upholds the dignity of all peoples basic human rights
3139174 we share with tibetans the same religion culture language and tradition and we are pained to see beating of protesting buddhist monks whom we revere very highly we also urge the government of nepal to stop the double standard when it comes to dealing with both tibetan and bhutanese
3139175 we are also concerned with the international communitys negative image of nepalese people as a whole due to repressive behavior of the government towards tibetan refugees we request that our government pays attention to world opinion we stand in solidarity with the tibetan refugees in this critical moment of tibetan history we appeal to all nepali political parties civic society and human rights organizations to help stop the governments repressive actions
3139176 the maoist camp commander told my relations that my brother died after beatings the commander said my brothers body was thrown in the narayani river
3139177 i suggest the nepali congress and the uml leadership to dissolve their parties first prior to demanding the ycl dissolution the government will be formed under the maoists leadership if hurdles are created to block such a formation under our leadership we will retaliate with equal force
3139178 then all bets would be off i am worried india should be aware of all possibilities
3139179 european union india japan and some other countries have made their commitment to support the maoists led government the maoists led government does not need the us support at all
3139180 there should be some sort of special relation between kathmandu and delhi we want a new relationship with india which means better relation better understanding and better cooperation
3139181 at the political level we will never side one country against another we will try to maintain equidistance between delhi and beijing in the political sense but not in practical sense and in matters of cooperation
3139182 it was only due to the open border between the two countries that nepal could not achieve the economic prosperity as it should have been if we want to live as a sovereign citizen of an independent county the open porous border must be controlled with immediate effect
3139183 the suspended king will spend some time in nagarjun before going to his own house nirmal niwas after abandoning narayanhiti
3139184 ive heard the king is planning to leave narayanhiti for another palace for a few days i dont think hell be back until after the declaration of the republic
3139185 the king leaving the main palace would be a way for all sides to save face
3139186 gyanendra will no doubt stay very quiet for the next two to three years but nobody can rule out the king coming back
3139187 we are going to bring in 50 000 young communist league members to celebrate the declaration of a republic on wednesday
3139188 the prime minister has urged prachanda to initiate moves to forge the necessary political consensus to form a new government as the biggest political party in the constituent assembly
3139189 where is your son they answered that they had not seen me for the last twenty years since the last contact was lost they also were brave enough to say
3139190 our son is lost this is all that we know and you can even have us killed but we cant say anything more
3139191 acting upon concerns of the chinese government towards ensuring safe passage of the torch 25 army and police personnel have reached camp 2 to prevent any activities against china
3139192 if the security personnel felt pressure to control any untoward incident we have made arrangement to deploy additional forces during the olympic torch run
3139193 nepal will not allow any such activities inside its territory
3139194 it would be good if king gyanendra peacefully voluntarily leaves the palace after the first sitting of the constituent assembly decides to abolish monarchy if he does not do so the government will treat him just like any common criminal and use the army or other force to oust him from there
3139195 if by any chance any leader of our party has given an impression that the maoists want to keep some sort of monarchy it is certainly not the official viewpoint of the party
3139196 our mandate is to establish peace in the country to do that the integration of nepal army and peoples liberation army is crucial so we will integrate both the armies to make a new national army
3139197 ambassador powell said the us took the election results positively as it was the verdict of the people the us would provide continued support to the constituent assembly and the new government to be formed
3139198 we have an organization being placed on the list of designated foreign terrorists organizations it has legal requirements that are placed on us we have to honor those legal requirements and well certainly do so in the case of nepal to the broader question certainly to the extent you have an organization that moves away from violence and terror and participates in a political process and engages in those kinds of legitimate activities that would certainly i think give people an opportunity to at least look again at that situation and that organization
3139199 but at this point you know theres no change in their status and well follow the law as appropriate

3139208 the president thinks that the way to address the issue of nepal is not by a statement that you are not going to the opening ceremonies what he is doing on nepal
3139209 we look forward to the formation of an assembly that reflects the will of the nepali people ready to begin the important work of framing a constitution that addresses their needs
3139210 my gut feeling is that this victory will make the maoists more and more of a responsible party they now have a tremendous burden of expectations to deliver on their promises and they are intelligent enough to realize they cant do it on their own
3139211 the nepalese government will never allow other powers read tibetans to conduct activities against china by using nepalese territory
3139212 we will continue our protests until the chinese suppression of tibet ends
3139213 china is happy to see the smooth constituent assembly election in nepal nepal is chinas friendly neighbor we respect the nepalese peoples choice of their social system and development road in line with their own national conditions it is our sincere hope that nepal can realize political stability and economic development at an early date china will continue to provide assistance to nepal within its own capacity
3139214 our stand is that politically indoctrinated people cannot be taken into the national army
3139215 i dont think the maoists want to stir up that particular nest of hornets or make a powerful enemy of an armed force
3139216 maoists in nepal have their hands full and they have an agenda for their own country
3139217 but it will be a tremendous encouragement to indian maoists
3139218 i think within one month all these things should be cleared and i hope and i expect that within one month we will organize the first meeting of the first assembly and that first meeting should abolish the monarchy
3139219 no i dont think so i dont think that from within the constitutional assembly there will be any kind of opposition because all parties have already taken their position against monarchy in favor of the republican system
3139220 we may not declare a republic on the first day of the first constituent assembly meeting declaring a republic may take a few days but there is no doubt it will happen
3139221 our focus has been on trying to attend to barbara and her needs and trying to deal with the shock of losing todd and trying to begin the grieving process as well
3139222 clearly elisabeth was a victim in this as well even though she was physically unscathed he said
3139223 having to deal with this event has been hard for her
3139224 she has shown incredible strength in the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it and there have been a lot of tears and hugs the fact that shes able to get in amongst it and already be able to address what happened is a testament to her strength of character
3139225 i believe random acts of violence are random acts of violence he said
3139226 it seems unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3139227 he was a great father a loving husband its hard to imagine a nicer person that this tragic and senseless thing could happen to
3139228 we are all definitely emotionally drained and have been playing with a lot of emotion for the last 48 hours said lindsey berg a former gopher
3139229 we will stay strong for the family and the whole u s delegation
3139230 this election had to take place it should have taken place last november and im not sure the country could have handled yet another postponement
3139231 first of all nepali congress should be swept away hit on their morale their fortress should be destroyed they should not be allowed to move around discourage them so that they completely lose the election
3139232 set up a district wide intelligence network to find whos who whos where whats he doing hows he what does he do on a daily basis and what kind of role he will have until the election
3139233 the pattern of these incidents has raised serious questions about whether the cpn m or significant parts of it are willing to engage in a genuinely free and fair democratic process
3139234 we did not find the security situation satisfactory in any of the four regions which we visited recently
3139235 candidates their cadres voters and human rights activists have not been provided security
3139236 in the past two weeks the activities of forces opposed to these agreements particularly the armed groups has intensified
3139237 there has been an upsurge of killings violence intimidation against candidates and voters and threats to disrupt the electoral process
3139238 an agreement has been reached to deploy the army during the polls if killings and abductions continue
3139239 at least 10 persons were injured when uml cadres clashed with maoists police fired bullets in the air to take the situation under control
3139240 the election commission has decided to disqualify 299 candidates on five grounds first 66 candidates from 28 political parties were underage
3139241 we have had only 34 days to put all of this in order not much advance warning usually these things take months to organize but weve somehow managed even with eight hour power cutoffs per day apart from approximately 13 000 national observers 20 international observers have already been trained and deployed in the field and 50 more international observers will go out to various districts on the 8th and 9th of april
3139242 the maoists know how you will vote they have such powerful binoculars that they can see where you mark on the ballot paper from the hills above the poll
3139243 the maoists have inserted computer chips within the ballot paper so that they will know who you voted for later they will come and chop off your heads
3139244 the king is laughing out loud from inside the palace walls because of the way the parties are fighting one another hes going to buy the elected representatives so that he can save the monarchy
3139245 50 of the elected nepali congress representatives will back some form of the monarchy
3139246 25 of the elected united marxist party representatives will back some form of the monarchy
3139247 all the regional madesh parties will vote to support the monarchy under pressure from the hindu fundamentalists in india
3139248 all the regional madesh parties are the brainchild of the current prime minister g p koirala nepali congress party why did he create them so that they can eliminate the maoist presence in southern nepal

3139250 after the dramatic rose revolution that saw him to power will saakashvili be able to unify his country the hardest tasks still lie ahead vast swathes of the country are outside his control having claimed independence they answer to no one everywhere you turn in south ossetia are signs of russian influence the police and soldiers wear russian uniforms cars have russian numberplates and the region even runs on russian time but technically south ossetia is part of georgia saakashvili is doing his best to win back their support but any invasion would surely be bloody
3139251 though i am deeply convinced that the struggle of tibetans will succeed only through a long term and peaceful process i have always admired these freedom fighters for their courage and their unwavering determination
3139252 tibet was independent in the past we reassert that belief that doesnt mean we demand that it be independent again but we are reinserting that into the discussion
3139253 we are certainly not happy with chinese president hu jintao
3139254 im going to stage this protest in order to get x
3139255 the dalai lama will never change his middle way of more autonomy but not independence and or the path of non violence
3139256 most tibetans will follow what the dalai lama says but there are many young people who want to demonstrate violently but this will not work
3139257 people have seen now what the chinese are doing in tibet and i think what people are seeing will increase our support those who love peace should support us
3139258 when i saw them khampa protesters rip down the chinese flag and put up the tibetan flag i was very very proud
3139259 the khampas who protested and all tibetans are in a very dangerous situation
3139260 china is not letting any journalists into tibet so those who continue to protest could be killed or imprisoned and nobody will know
3139261 from 1960 to 1965 our lives up there were really miserable we nearly starved to death and had very basic accommodation
3139262 when america stopped its support we carried on ourselves their stopping support did not bother us we had their training and their weapons
3139263 china should give tibet more autonomy but so far they are not going in the right direction
3139264 even though they are very big and powerful what they are doing is illegal we need other nations to support us strongly
3139265 all hotel rooms and offices are considered to be subject to on site or remote technical monitoring at all times
3139266 hotel rooms residences and offices may be accessed at any time without the occupants consent or knowledge
3139267 travelers are strongly encouraged to be aware of their surroundings while in china
3139268 continued vigilance is necessary to reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim of crime
3139269 no reasonable expectation of privacy in public or private locations
3139270 many hotels and apartment buildings may be of substandard construction lack emergency exits fire suppression systems carbon monoxide monitors and standard security equipment locks alarms and personnel
3139271 the tibetans said they wanted to pressure the united nations to investigate a crackdown by beijing on the fiercest uprising against chinese rule of the himalayan region in nearly two decades
3139272 i dont know why police are attacking our peaceful demonstration
3139273 the whole thing was very surprising no rumours no nothing i heard a commotion outside and looked out to see about 15 very young police or army in the middle of the street sitting down in a group they then got up and pulled riot gear from the back of a military truck geared up and formed a human barricade across ramoche 4 more riot police or army formations like a phalanx charged down ramoche almost immediately they were rushed by a massive group of tibetans it was just 15 young police with their riot shields face a group fof 500 1000 tibetans the tibetans were armed with iron bars and rocks and chunks of conrete i dont know where they got all this stuff from they then charged at the plice army pelting them with objects some of their sheilds broke and some fell obviously injured they ran down ramoche with the crowd chasing them some tibetan friends told me that another mob of tibetans was coming down from the other end of the road so it is sickening to think what happen to those young riot police the noise was so intense i have never seen or heard anything like it i was so amazed that all sorts of tibetans were taking part kids women men it was a total riot mentality i am also very surprised that they did not take out the surviellence camera on the corner of the street everyone knows it is there they were being recorded they didnt seem to care at all
3139274 i then walked down mentsikung lu towards the jokhang and hid inside an establishment while the rioting spread to the jokhang area and the whole place just went crazy i have been in name withheld ever since
3139275 i have talked with army personel and they appear very disorganised they do not know what is going on and who is giving orders a group of tourists was escorted out of the hotel and dropped on jiangsu lu they were heavily questioned and asked where they had hidden their camera memory sticks the army guys said that they should look for a hotel as the one they had been staying in had burned from what i understand the army just left them there on jiangsu lu with no clue whatsoever
3139276 now it looks like a total war zone maybe half the shops are burnt hundreds of them there is telegraph poles knocked down by tanks a tank has driven straight over the top of an suv out the front of the hotel there is a barricade of smashed cars that the tanks have bulldozed into a protective ring around the army compound out front of the jokhang we have heard that the army is inside the jokhang buut cannot go over there to look we also heard reports of a young injured monk who look unconscious being carried on the back of a soldier
3139277 yesterday we saw some very shocking things that i never want to see again
3139278 i saw army going from door to door knocking and sometimes dragging people outside we could hear them banging on doors for some time i saw what i think is chinese special forces with high powered rifles i saw one soldier fire his weapon into a shop the noise was so loud i couldnt see what was inside i havent seen any bodies on the street but i was inside during the worst of the action the most horrible thing i saw was a person riding their bike down the road a mob ran up behind them and pelted them with large rocks knocking him her to the ground
3139279 i heard occasional gunfire i assume it is gunfire this morning it is now quite quiet but everyone is very scared we have enough food for some time but have heard of many chinese workers locked in their workplaces and to scared to come out friends talked to some workers who said they had eaten all their ramen noodles and had no food left
3139280 yesterday we saw the military escorting chinese people out of the barkor area under heavy guard we think they were hiding in their shops and only came out when the military showed up they looked very very scared
3139281 friends heard the train whistle or horn this morning so we think the train is running but we assume only outgoing traffic we think a lot of chinese people will be leaving lhasa
3139282 i am inside a hotel location withheld and have been here since the start of the rioting we cannot go outside there are maybe 50 of us inside maybe a few more we really cannot see or hear much we have heard that the mosque is damaged and that the old part of town is now completely sealed off we heard this morning that there had been a big clash with muslims but have no confirmation of this we are ok they are serving only two meals a day as there is not much food we are worried about running out of food
3139283 india and nepals constituent assembly the indian government is duty bound to prevent the criminal militant nexus from using bihar and uttar pradesh as a base from which to threaten the constituent assembly process in nepal
3139284 that place from which one escapes if one has the chance
3139285 nepals army cannot recruit anyone who has been indoctrinated with political ideology the national army should be competent professional impartial and obedient to the order of the military chain of command
3139286 the army is the nations wing and it should not be politicized there is not a single example of integration between indoctrinated fighters and the professional army in the world even in our context the maoist army will not be integrated with the nepal army
3139287 such activities are having a serious impact on the human rights of others and on establishing an environment conducive to free and fair constituent assembly elections
3139288 nepal has undergone profound changes moving from monarchy to an emerging democracy with an emerging economy
3139289 the maoist party was ready to initiate yet another peoples revolt to capture the state we may have rejoined the government but we have not completely ignored the option of peoples revolt
3139290 dont ask me about the pact now both the parties and i know what was in it democracy has weakened so it is necessary to strengthen the bond between monarchy and democracy nepali people have a large heart they can accommodate all nepalis including the king
3139291 i am not so power oriented of course i have a lot of supporters who ask me who want me to be prime minister but you can also work without being a prime minister
3139292 we have invited like minded people to form a coalition that would fight to save constitutional monarchy
3139293 since the local bodies have still not been re constituted according to the agreement among the seven political parties the peoples government has been activated to resolve the problems faced by the people in the district and local level and extend help in development related works
3139294 the decision to abolish the monarchy in april does not reflect the majority view of the people this isnt democracy some leaders have tried to take action that is against cultural social and traditional values
3139295 security personnel will also be deployed at regular intervals in the highway to prevent attacks
3139296 there are protest rallies every day and clashes every now and then the town is shut down all the schools businesses and shops are closed with no sight of any vehicles and the volume of people is very low on the streets
3139297 if democracy and peace prevail in the country nepal would take off very fast economically in ten years
3139298 the communists are deadlier than the monarchy i have been advocating the cause of monarchy only after witnessing for myself the maoists erratic activities and utterances being made of late
3139299 it is by now universally accepted in nepal that gyanendra his criminally inclined son paras and the royal army chief prajjwal rana were the ringleaders of the bloody palace coup detat
3139300 what about members of the army are there still significant numbers of secret monarchists within their ranks
3139301 above the rank of major colonel and general there are still people with a privileged background who are linked with the shah and rana families
3139302 when the political problems are solved the psychosocial problems will be solved
3139303 o relato de sua hist ria ser algo muito triste e psicologicamente perturbado e provavelmente ser a coisa mais sombria que j fez
3139304 ele um param dico em metr polis um cara consciente bacana e bom
3139305 ele meio que um outsider cresceu em orfanatos e teve uma inf ncia muito dura ele trazido trama porque forma uma amizade muito r pida com chloe eventualmente ele come ar a ter apag es e fica curioso para saber o que est acontecendo consigo e o que descobre algo horr vel
3139306 onde e como esse relacionamento surgir ser algo completamente novo para a s rie eu vou dizer o seguinte n o acho que clark tenha tido a oportunidade de ter um amigo como davis e vice versa n o posso ser mais vago do que isso posso eles ter o uma singular rela o de amizade e camaradagem isso soa esquisito n eu n o posso falar sobre isso realmente n o posso
3139307 eventualmente davis se tornar o apocalipse e lembrar o personagem que os f s dos quadrinhos est o esperando ver espero que eles gostem do que iremos fazer com o vil o porque trata se de nossa leitura dele temos a b n o da dc comics empresa respons vel pelos quadrinhos do super homem e n o vamos estragar qualquer hist ria anterior do apocalipse mas estamos fazendo uma interpreta o dele e adicionando elementos a essa hist ria esperamos que os f s percebam isso e farei o meu melhor na pele dele
3139308 ele est pedindo por isso voc sabe quem n o gostaria de acertar aquele cara
3139309 is in tatters particularly in some terai southern districts and the culture of impunity remains intact
3139310 the loss of tigers in suklaphanta is undoubtedly linked to the powerful global mafia that controls illegal wildlife trade
3139311 the evidence suggests that nepals endangered tigers are increasingly vulnerable to this despicable trade that has already emptied several indian tiger reserves clearly this is symptomatic of the larger tiger crisis in the region we need a stronger more sustained response to this issue in order to protect the future of tigers in the wild
3139312 with only 4 000 tigers remaining in the wild every tiger lost to poaching pushes this magnificent animal closer to extinction
3139313 tigers cannot be saved in small forest fragments when faced with a threat like illegal wildlife trade this is a global problem that needs the concerted effort of governments grassroots organizations and all concerned individuals
3139314 in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3139315 russian actions in clear violation of international law have no place in 21st century europe
3139316 we should move ahead with the resolution despite russian veto threats and submit russia to the court of world public opinion
3139317 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3139318 it is the responsibility of the leading nations of the world to ensure that history continues to be a record of humanitys progress toward respecting the values and security of free people
3139319 the future of georgia should be decided by the georgian people
3139320 the sooner russian military action ceases russian forces are withdrawn and georgias borders are respected the sooner a settlement of georgias internal disputes can be achieved and regional security enhanced
3139321 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3139322 weve had two meetings behind closed doors on this we have agreed with the other members of the security council which of course includes russia on some elements of a way forward but we do not have final agreement but as you know from following this in a dozen other contexts including the iranian one day one were still debating and disagreeing day two or day three we often can come together on some final a compromise position and thats what were working towards
3139323 and my administration has been engaged with both sides in this trying to get a cease fire and saying that the status quo ante for all troops should be august 6th

3139332 yo creo que siempre las cosas que suceden en el camar n debieran quedar ah
3139333 es que yo creo que se van sumando muchas cosas pero en el fondo todo viene de la forma como nos hicieron los goles a lo mejor eran evitables y eso va generando cierto grado de intolerancia dentro de la cancha y de repente se exacerban un poco los nimos pero no es nada grave
3139334 estamos en un gran momento y cuando todos pensamos que las cosas est n bien tenemos esos errores que te dan bronca te dan calentura y eso es bueno porque demuestra que todos queremos lo mismo que es ganar un campeonato y que todos estamos tirando para un mismo lado

3139347 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change

3139368 the victims were inside their yacht the men boarded and attacked
3139369 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3139370 dont allow the fruits of the victory achieved through the sacrifices of the mujahedeen fighting in afghanistan iraq and the tribal belt of pakistan to be hijacked by the politicians who sat passively while the girls and boys of the red mosque perished and burned
3139371 these are the same politicians who follow the tenets of an alien western democratic system and judiciary and exploit islam to fulfill their own greedy aims
3139372 were there to listen to understand what happened he said monday adding that the police would like
3139373 one thing is for sure we have to do better than what weve been doing
3139374 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3139375 what we are seeing are youngsters a community that is in revolt because they dont like they way they are being treated
3139376 what i can say in that album is none will be trashed
3139377 none will be trashed in that cd what we want is when we worked with warner all the songs are potential singles
3139378 will i really be ready for this will i be all original but when i hear an original song thats a hit in the radio whether foreigner or not at least theres hope
3139379 its really ok it just has to an exceptional song that will really touch some peoples lives and they can sing along its risky pero good enough this is taking the harder route
3139380 there should really bea song that will top the way you look at me so that there will be another big hit because thats what singers or performers really need as ive said a while ago we are competing with the rest of the world already not only us
3139381 its like this is really the album we should push it to the extent that it could reallyb e a hit again in the asian market malaysia or singapore
3139382 what they really say is its not that christian its because you already did it so thats why this is the title so this is just a follow up so hopefully itll get the same success like the first one
3139383 meron diyang balance parang may movie theme mayroon tagalog merong parang r amp b its still all about love
3139384 he really just wrote random thoughts that he came up and became a poem and then here its ok then we included it in the album
3139385 the one who won my heart is the typical christian bautista ballad and well its close to my heart right now
3139386 whats cool about andrew fromm is he can make different kinds of songs last song that he did for me is she could be on my second album a little bit rock this creation a little bit of r amp b

3139389 it is early in the process to know the kind of damage so we dont really know a dollar figure
3139390 theres also the question of how much of the damage was insured apparently there are quite a few renters in the neighbourhood and many of them did not have tenants insurance
3139391 for as long as you cant operate and youre not making the money that you would normally make theres insurance coverage for that
3139392 its too late after the event to adjust your coverage to cover that sort of thing but the main thing is to get the claim in and hear what your personal situation is from your insurance company
3139393 in the meantime youve got to look after yourself as if you were not insured and youve got to make sure that any damages are mitigated by any actions you can take
3139394 we still have a few issues with this development vehicle
3139395 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3139396 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3139397 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3139398 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3139399 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3139400 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3139401 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3139402 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3139403 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3139404 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3139405 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3139406 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3139407 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3139408 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion

3139412 its been taken as seriously as anything else weve had all the way through were not ruling it out gerry and kate are very good at saying thats definitely not madeleine quite quickly in this case theyre not sure until we have a better resolution image and have a bit more information on what was or wasnt said we wont know
3139413 the people are being pushed towards a revolution the indian government is not serious about resolving the kashmir issue
3139414 we do not have a single ampoule remaining in the central store on the wards they are some but the situation is dangerous
3139415 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimag the real motive is a complete islamisation sic of the valley

3139423 imagine a political candidate running for office by merely circulating a resume
3139424 an executive must begin to see himself or herself as a product with discernable qualities and characteristics that set them apart from the many options a company has in todays job market
3139425 executives must then headline their campaign with these qualities which is something a resume does not do

3139431 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3139432 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3139433 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3139434 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3139435 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3139436 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3139437 more than half of ischemic strokes 52 percent in men and 54 percent in women may have been prevented through adherence to a healthy lifestyle

3139441 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3139442 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
3139443 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3139444 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3139445 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
3139446 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
3139447 when the monarchy ended and a popular government was installed under the leadership of sheikh abdullah the power base shifted to the valley of kashmir which has a larger population than jammu
3139448 i warned indias first prime minister jawaharlal nehru of the consequences of the simmering discontent in jammu soon after the states accession to india
3139449 its ironical that kashmiris who dont even consider themselves to be indians are getting all the blessings of the government while the people of jammu are always treated as second class citizens
3139450 conspiracy to reduce the majority community in jammu and kashmir into a minority
3139451 were already a long way down the operational separation route the industry is investing and theyre investing over 1 billion a year in a market thats worth around 6 billion
3139452 so to lay a whole new level of change and even more uncertainty for the business i think would be a real challenge for telecom and could in fact increase costs with perhaps some rather uncertain benefits

3139643 this exceptional award was given also in recognition of bells many efforts to integrate the site of morgantina and its history within the community of aidone it is a testament as well to the many excellent personal and professional relationships he has cultivated over the years

3139729 norman roberson beloved friend colleague and legendary presence at the american academy in rome for 20 years passed away early in the morning of 29 may 2008
3139730 the cause of death was lung cancer norm had not been able to be at the academy for several months but he was never far from our thoughts and many academy trustees staff and fellows were often by his side
3139731 all trustees fellows residents and friends of the academy are invited to attend the service or to send reminiscences to share with norms family either during the ceremony or in a guest book prepared for his daughters cory cryer and shelly desmond contributions are also invited for the norman roberson book fund in etruscan studies his daughters thought it would please their father to have the academy remember his scholarship writing friendship and the many happy trips and tours he took with members of the academy family in this way
3139732 for many fellows newly arriving in rome norms was the first face to greet them at the academy it was a welcome sight part jupiter part santa claus norm exuded an authority tempered by kindness the phone could be jangling the fax humming and the doorbell insistent but norm remained unruffled and calm through it all he always greeted me as though i were the most important person in the universe and i know i wasnt the only one to receive such vip treatment over the years i heard about his etruscan studies his family and his previous work in more exotic and dangerous locales one of his last major undertakings his trip to the us last fall i learned about in pictures on his return because he was losing his voice the trip was much anticipated norm had not been back to the states in many years and he was relishing this peripatetic journey across the country we discussed his outfit for an event at the posh newport yacht club where norm much to his delight planned to transform his usual appearance with navy blazer and slacks i am glad he had the chance to see family and reconnect with friends personally i have lost a wonderful friend and the society of fellows which i represent here today has lost one of the academy employees who in myriad ways make the fellows year a time to remember

3139745 capcom is extremely excited to work with grin to bring the world class franchise of bionic commando into the 21st century
3139746 capcom has also always been strong partners with nvidia and with bionic commando we are taking things to a new level by adding gpu accelerated physx to increase the titles realism
3139747 physics is changing the industry we evaluated all of the commercial physics systems out there for gaming and the choice was easy
3139748 nvidia physx runs faster than other solutions and it works across pcs and consoles which is important to us because bionic commando will ship on all major platforms we believe physx will help make the game seem even more lifelike and immersive
3139749 the gaming industry and gamers themselves are excited to see the return of bionic commando the addition of physics effects using physx technology is going to add a huge amount of extra fun and depth to the game play
3139750 we cant wait to see what the talented team at capcom and grin can create using the nvidia physx technology and hands on support from our developer technology team

3139758 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3139759 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3139761 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3139762 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3139764 all i know is that in the past when anythings been taken away from erasmus hes always come back with a vengeance
3139765 and thats the plan he needs to come back with a vengeance wanting to establish himself as a good football player in this league
3139766 its always been a first round draft pick and trying to overcome injuries
3139767 its been pretty hard but i enjoy the patience the redskins have had and i feel like im ready to go out there and actually show what first round is
3139768 weve seen in the training room and the weight room that desire to get back healthy
3139769 he has definitely overachieved there were very hopeful thats going to carry over
3139770 it adds another very good football player into the mix
3139771 i dont want to judge erasmus too quickly weve got some other guys who have been pushing for some playing time as well so its nice to have that problem
3139772 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3139773 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3139792 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3139793 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3139794 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3139795 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them

3139810 no country annnounces these sort of political debates without discussing with the participants

3139845 wat mij betreft zijn de kredietverstrekkende bedrijven zelf aan zet

3139851 geloof mij als een bank twijfelt aan de kredietwaardigheid van een aanvrager dan verstrekt die echt geen lening

3139854 he appreciated everybody so much and he loved all the customers who came in here
3139855 he expressed his opinion and even if you sometimes didnt want his opinion he would express it anyway the bottom line is he was pretty much right when he did
3139856 he just wanted to help out so much that he put all his time into it

3139866 today i can say that we will not need additional funds these problems are behind us we will not return to the market
3139867 we deliberately raised more capital than we lost last year we believe that will allow us to not have to go back to the equity market in the foreseeable future
3139868 right now we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
3139869 the company is exposed to 133 billion of securities backed by subprime and so called alt a mortgages it has reported unrealized losses on these securities but that hasnt run through the companys income statement if freddie has to realize losses of 30 on these exposures the company would probably need more than 40 billion in capital

3139872 this incident just shows how islamophobic the political climate is right now
3139873 baseless smears about a muslim with a very good reputation was used to marginalize not only him but the community from the political process
3139874 we need muslim americans to get excited about the campaign and theres a lot to get excited about

3139882 every time i call the national institutes of health to check on a grant proposal
3139883 i become painfully aware of the influence the brain has on the gut
3139884 the majority of patients with anxiety and depression will also have alterations of their gi function
3139885 rather than mother natures trying to pack 100 million neurons someplace in the brain or spinal cord and then sending long connections to the gi tract the circuitry is right next to the systems that require control
3139886 the brain in your gut has stored within its neural networks a variety of behavioral programs like a library the digestive state determines which program your gut calls up from its library and runs
3139887 it monitors the progress of digestion it detects nutrients and it measures acid and salts its a little chemical lab
3139888 it was like saying that new york taxi drivers never miss a showing of tosca at the met
