680001 theres no doubt that gas prices have put a serious dent in new jerseys summer fun
680002 it is perhaps a sign of the publics anxiety that many new jerseyans support drilling off our coast as well as elsewhere in the country even though they dont have a lot of confidence it will actually bring down prices

680006 i work helping to assist students with disabilities to acquire skills training and whatever their needs are to be independent and successful
680007 it helped them to look at the environment of being on a college campus and the realities of going off to college and living on their own
680008 one of the major things that we do is provide opportunities for the students to identify specific strategies and accommodations that they will need when they go off to college
680009 i cant sit in a room and there be noise off in the distance
680010 before i came to this course i had trouble with procrastination trouble organizing things i had some trouble test taking
680011 the transition between high school and college is tough for a normal student
680012 if i hadnt had this two week course i probably wouldnt have even made it a month in college but with what theyve taught me here i think i can make it
680013 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
680014 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
680015 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
680016 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
680017 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
680018 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
680019 what weve inherited from 12 years of mr costello as treasurer are the highest interest rates in the world together with his being part and parcel of a government which was engaged in climate change denial and workchoices
680020 we are all publicly saying what a terrific bloke he is what a fantastic political talent he is how much we miss him we love him we want him
680021 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
680022 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall calibre and quality of the investigation
680023 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
680024 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
680025 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
680026 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
680027 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
680028 its unacceptable that municipalities are trying to budget in the dark with a blindfold
680029 they need to get at this issue and they need to get at it in a big strong way
680030 we are close the partners have agreed that we want to get it done and we want to get it right
680031 now were waiting in the dog days of summer with bated breath to find out what the plan is
680032 and the unfortunate reality is the weight of that downloading burden continues to crush municipalities
680033 this is the only province in canada that puts social services on property taxes
680034 could have been done on the back of a napkin at a tim hortons on a saturday afternoon coffee session
680035 not just toronto but cities and towns across ontario go into their yearly discussions with the hope that the province may or may not pick up a new cost
680036 nous avons maintenant la confirmation que 145 personnes ont t tu es
680037 le bruit courait que des rochers tombaient sur nous et nous avons tous couru comme les autres
680038 beaucoup denfants et de femmes appelaient laide et jai vu des gens d gringoler de la colline

680040 underscores the urgency and the importance of our reform agenda
680041 there are some things we can control and there are some things we cant and those things within our control well we oughtto make sure we get the best possible settings
680042 with tax there are long lead times you cant just click your fingers
680043 i think the public do understand the need and in some ways are hungry for some long term thinking and policy action i think theyre up for a decent discussion on it all
680044 some people will take exception to some of the things that it says that will be a good thing
680045 the green paper on emissions trading was different it has dispositions
680046 this paper is a piece of analysis from them it explains how the system has evolved how it compares internationally it discusses the economic context of tax and the transfer payments saving incentive all that sort of stuff
680047 there was a rolled gold opportunity under the previous government when money was rolling in and revenues were revised up continuously
680048 given the more uncertain international outlook i would not want to be making any predictions about that
680049 priority from my point of view is to make the system more internationally competitive so weve got a system that rewards hard work that untangles a lot of the disincentives that are out there between the income tax system and the welfare system and just try to harmonise andsimplify the whole system which has become excessively complex
680050 for me it is not a race to the bottom we need a tax system that provides a revenue stream which supports our enduring quality of life
680051 africans are starting to prove that not only can they feed themselves but theyll help feed the rest of the world too
680052 ive been telling americans come to east africa there are tremendous opportunities here
680053 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
680054 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
680055 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
680056 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
680057 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
680058 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
680059 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
680060 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
680061 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
680062 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
680063 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
680064 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested
680065 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins
680066 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned

680069 you are everything to me and i will love you forever
680070 youre meant to be my friend mo and youre treating me differently you havent done this to anyone else in the house its like you constantly want attention
680071 all i wanted to do was go for a run
680072 can you please just stay awake please dont get me stressed
680073 everyone was screaming and jumping around in there i couldnt sleep
680074 hang up your badge if you cant deal with it
680075 yeah i have im not enjoying it i would rather be in hell im turning into a whiner
680076 if they were my friends they wouldnt be doing it anyway
680077 they wouldnt be putting me in that situation im not looking forward to this week
680078 no no i was just lying down they were just waiting to do that rachel

680080 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is complete we will investigate the cause
680081 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
680082 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation

680089 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
680090 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
680091 hes a very intelligent man and he has a lot of interesting ideas
680092 hes basically being blamed for every bicycle that has disappeared over many many years in toronto
680093 he just has a very unique way of looking at things
680094 he was a good employer even though he could be demanding at times
680095 i find it very hard to believe what people are saying about him
680096 i cannot believe that he would tell someone to steal a bike
680097 he was just very unapproachable and almost condescending to people who would ask questions
680098 its unacceptable that municipalities are trying to budget in the dark with a blindfold

680109 ja ich bin wirklich gl cklich vor allem f r timo denn er hatte vor ein paar wochen einen ziemlich heftigen unfall er hat gezeigt dass er ihn gut berstanden hat und hatte ein gro artiges wochenende
680110 es ist bemerkenswert dass er das ganze wochenende ber bei der musik war oder
680111 absolut vom freitag an als er aus der boxengasse fuhr wir waren schon von seiner pers nlichen geschwindigkeit auf dem hockenheimring berzeugt er war in der lage mit den vorderen mitzuhalten das hat ihm zuversicht verliehen
680112 er hatte meiner meinung nach ungl cklicherweise keinen besonders guten start dann fiel er hinter david coulthard zur ck und verlor eine menge zeit sp ter hinter piquet auf der anderen seite sind dies zehn punkte f r das team das war eine solide leistung
680113 und wie sehen sie ihre leistung in valencia k nnen sie den schwung mitnehmen
680114 das ist nat rlich unsere absicht auf der anderen seite m ssen wir uns auch ber das n chstj hrige auto gedanken machen wir haben aber meiner meinung nach zumindest bewiesen dass wir unsere position von dieser gruppe halten k nnen also vor renault und red bull und dass wir auf bmw aufschlie en das h ngt vom strecken typ ab wir m ssen in das auto f r 2009 viel energie hinein stecken gleichzeitig m ssen wir diesen vorsprung aufrechterhalten
680115 the muslims have said either we kneel or theyre going to kill us i dont intend to kneel and i dont advocate to anybody that we kneel and john doesnt advocate to anybody that we kneel
680116 muslim leaders and arab american groups quickly denounced the bigoted comments by day a pensacola resident medal of honor recipient and member of the swift boat veterans for truth attack machine from 2004 this is as close to racist as it gets these are cheap street tactics said khaled saffuri who helped organize arab outreach for president bushs 2000 campaign but is now a libertarian even if this is called a mistake or a slip of the tongue it shows a bigger problem with racism mccain and the republican party should denounce this its perpetuating a form of islam ophobia said saif ishoof a miami republican and president of the center for voter advocacy a nonpartisan group in florida that educates muslims about the political process

680119 herr kamps platz zwei f r timo nach dem unfall in hockenheim
680120 hockenheim war schon nicht so schlecht der zweite platz ist sicherlich eine riesenbest tigung f r das was wir uns in der ganzen geschichte ausgerechnet haben dass es schon so weit nach vorne geht damit habe ich im moment noch nicht gerechnet aber wer meine statements von vorher kennt der wei dass ich an dieses konzept geglaubt habe und auch weiterhin glaube jetzt geht es nach vorne dass die schritte manchmal ein bisschen schneller kommen dass man vielleicht mal eine stufe bergeht das ist ja sch n
680121 nat rlich sind zwei autos vor timo ausgeschieden aber er ist trotzdem vor kimi r ikk nen ins ziel gekommen
680122 der speed auf der strecke hat auch im vergleich zu den anderen fahrzeugen gestimmt das ist der hammer man muss da das tr umen mal aufh ren wir haben eine step by step philosophie gemacht wir wollten ab mitte der saison aufschlie en erstmal fahrerisch das war die erste geschichte ab und zu mal ein p nktchen holen
680123 n chstes jahr wollen wir permanent in die punkte und vielleicht mal ein podium vielleicht geht es auch schneller aber man darf nicht sagen das ist jetzt best tigt und es wird immer so weitergehen es waren sicher sehr gute bedingungen die timo und dem auto und dem team entgegengekommen sind jetzt schauen wir weiter aber auf jeden fall muss man mit toyota und timo rechnen
680124 timo hat das verdient wir haben von anfang an an toyota geglaubt heute hat man gesehen dass das richtig war wir haben gesagt wir wollen 2010 mit toyota weltmeister werden wer das nicht glaubt dem haben wir es heute mal gezeigt
680125 man muss ein bisschen was geben dann kriegt man auch sehr viel
680126 die stimmung bei toyota ist unglaublich positiv und zufrieden seit timo da ist er hat sich gro artig eingef gt nicht wahr
680127 ja aber die jungs sind ja auch in ordnung man muss ein bisschen was geben dann kriegt man auch sehr viel so ist das im leben geben und nehmen sind ein zusammenspiel
680128 wie war denn ihr herzschlag als kimi r ikk nen von hinten dahergebraust kam
680129 der war gar nicht so hoch weil ich wei dass timo ein taktisch kluges rennen fahren kann da muss erst einmal jemand vorbeikommen kimi war schon sehr schnell zum schluss aber wie wir gesehen haben ist es gut gegangen
680130 was macht ihr w hrend der sommerpause g nnt ihr euch einen urlaub
680131 nein er hat schon ein paar verpflichtungen aber ich wei im moment gar nicht welche er fliegt nach amerika wo er bei einem oldtimerevent ein showrennen mitf hrt drumrum gibt es einige tage wo er ein bisschen relaxen kann und dann geht es in valencia weiter

680134 the finepix f100fd doesnt exactly break from the megapixel madness phenomenon it too has a 12 megapixel sensor like the f50 however it uses a new 8th generation superccd hr sensor and a new image processor so hopefully it will be better able to deal with the noise that comes at such a high resolution the f100fd performs slightly better than other compact cameras up to a point iso 800 but above that images become a noisy mess the camera is marred by other flaws as well including a slow lens difficult to access menu system and poor battery life the finepix f100fd certainly isnt a bad camera its just an average one which is a disappointment considering its heritage
680135 the pentax optio w60 compact digital camera is lightweight and fully waterproof the optio w60 features 10 megapixels and a 5x zoom lens with 28mm wide angle capability the enhanced design of the optio w60 allows the camera to operate up to 13 feet underwater for two hours and at extreme temperatures well below freezing the optio w60 captures movies at resolutions as high as 1280 x 720 pixels which is comparable to hdtv resolution at 720p the camera also features movie shake reduction to automatically correct camera shake and an underwater movie mode that optimizes color settings for recording underwater

680137 sigma an admired lens company that only recently started making cameras has introduced the dp1 the worlds first compact camera with an s l r sized sensor inside its whats called an aps c size sensor the same size as what is in pro cameras like the canon 40d and the nikon d300 it measures about 1 inch diagonally the lack of zoom is probably a deal killer for a lot of people but not everyone the 16 8mm f 4 lens the film camera equivalent of 28mm gives it a wonderfully wide angle which is ideal for landscapes cityscapes interior real estate shots and so on
680138 replacing the popular eos 400d at the entry level of canons dslr range the eos 1000d eos rebel xs in the u s brings yet another level to canons dslr nomenclature reflecting the days of film when canons lowest priced slr cameras had four figure model names the 1000d has been designed for photographers who want to upgrade from a digicam to a more capable better performing dslr it boasts the same 10 1 megapixel imager as the 400d but is smaller and lighter and supports live view shooting low light performance was very good shots taken at iso 1600 were sharp and color accurate with only a hint of visible color noise this was eliminated with the high iso noise reduction setting long exposure noise reduction produced minimal image softening lateral chromatic aberration was generally low and negligible at the 55mm focal length setting
680139 the sd890 is is actually a little lighter than the nikon coolpix p60 i tested recently but its also far more compact so the weight about 5 5 ounces body only is more noticeable and at 2 3 by 3 8 by 1 1 inches hwd the sd890 is is small enough to tote around easily yet the camera strikes a nice balance between size and comfort as its big enough to hold easily without being too bulky thanks in large part to a generous feature set and good picture quality the canon powershot sd890 is holds its own among compact cameras still theres no getting around the high 400 price tag
680140 the new 10 megapixel olympus e 520 dslr camera is an evolutionary upgrade to last years popular e 510 model it boasts some notable advancements including wireless ttl flash control shadow adjustment technology improved image processing two extra scene modes face detection and more convenient auto focus options in live view i personally enjoyed using the e 520 very much and doubt it would disappoint anybody who decides to buy one after careful weighing of its strengths and weaknesses the olympus e 520 is a camera that i can recommend to beginners and enthusiasts alike and i would not be too surprised to see it in the hands of a few pro photographers either
680141 isnt it great when a company puts out a product thats not only better than the one it replaces but superior in some ways to higher end models

680143 billed as the worlds longest zoom the olympus sp 570 uz is a model bound to catch the eye the 10 1 million pixel model boasts an impressive 35mm equivalent zoom range of 26 520mm or 20x beating the 18x range of recently reviewed models from the likes of nikon and sony olympus is really hitting its optical limits with the sp 570 uz the lens struggles to perform well and there are countless instances of chromatic aberration or purple fringing throughout the pictures similarly the af and image stabilization struggled at the far reaches of the telephoto end and i had several out of focus blurred shots
680144 the fujifilm finepix s8100fd is a new ultra zoom camera sporting an 18x zoom lens offering a focal length of 27 486mm announced a mere 6 months after its predecessor the s8000fd the new model adds more megapixels 10 to be precise new zoom bracketing and instant zoom modes and some new continuous shooting modes the fujifilm finepix s8100fd sets itself up as a jack of all trades device for a very reasonable price on that claim it very nearly succeeds though its not perfect

680162 digital camera manufacturers are constantly adding new features in efforts to differentiate themselves from their competitors
680163 however in adding new features ease of use becomes critical in maintaining satisfaction as average satisfaction scores are 235 points lower among customers who say their features were difficult to use compared with those customers who say the features were easy to use designing features with the consumer in mind and providing clear and concise instructions can help maintain high satisfaction levels with new features and functions
680164 a worldwide community of photographers provided valuable insight and feedback as part of the lightroom 2 public beta program ultimately helping us deliver a better product
680165 weve considered their requests which helped us develop useful features that make it easier than ever for our customers to quickly refine enhance and present brilliant photographs
680166 one of the big reasons why lightroom has become such a phenomenon among serious photographers is that adobe built it with the input of a very vocal user community
680167 adobe really listens to the issues and challenges todays photographers face and theyve built a complete solution that not only meets the needs of photographers it really feels like it was made just for us the enhancements to lightroom 2 combined with the power of photoshop give photographers the ultimate freedom to produce professional images quickly

680175 our second quarter represents another step in our journey to create a growing profitable kodak
680176 the digital franchise that we have built performed well during the quarter customer acceptance of our digital plates digital cameras digital picture frames retail printing systems and consumer and commercial inkjet products remains strong
680177 in our traditional business entertainment imaging revenue improved but unprecedented commodity cost increases across the business are presenting a headwind that we are aggressively addressing
680178 we delivered another quarter of growth which reinforces our confidence in the promise of our digital franchise
680179 as a result we have decided to increase our investment in a number of product lines in just two examples we are increasing the projected volumes for our consumer inkjet printers for 2009 and pulling forward by three to six months the delivery date of our new stream inkjet technology for commercial printers the more we develop these opportunities the more we see the value in investing to accelerate growth
680180 we have built a great portfolio of digital businesses and we have exciting new product introductions planned for the remainder of the year
680181 while we face challenges today from rising raw material prices and a soft economy our view of the future remains confident and optimistic our boards recent decision to repurchase up to 1 0 billion of our own outstanding shares and the increased investment in our most promising digital businesses underscore the confidence we have in our ability to create significant value for our shareholders
680182 this printer is about the size of one and a half xboxes laid on their sides and is all decked out in silver apart from black cheeks at either end and a black bar across its top bearing the canon logo
680183 this model offers 10 1 million effective pixels on a 1 2 33 inch ccd with a total population of 10 7 million pixels the cameras most significant feature though is its 18x optical zoom covering a range of 27 486mm in 35mm terms the camera also has built in vibration reduction vr to avoid camera shake especially useful at the long end of the zoom as super zoom bridge cameras go the nikon coolpix p80 is okay but there are reservations while the handling is generally good and instinctual it feels a bit of a lightweight and its not the most responsive in the world image quality is average too with good exposure and color but its let down by fringing and noise
680184 the epson r2880 features a couple of very welcome enhancements that bring the printer up to the same output quality as the larger 4880 7880 and 9880 models
680185 the digital darkroom questions ddq started as a total experiment
680186 part of the motivation for the ddq email was my notion that people learn well in the question and answer format i had been answering questions for about six years when publishers began telling me what a great book it would make i agreed so i decided it was time to make it happen
680187 today many photographers feel they dont need a lot of new information because they have already learned so much but what ive found is that what theyve learned isnt always accurate
680188 writing take your best shot provided an opportunity for me to settle some common questions once and for all readers will discover how to reconcile the conflicting information theyve received from various sources
680189 i love photography i love technology i love digital imaging and i love writing

680191 while many respondents see benefits to both delivery methods net to retail is clearly taking some business away from net to mail services and some 60 of survey respondents indicated that they expect their online printing to shift even more toward net to retail in the coming year online photo services should continue to differentiate their products and services from those available at retail focusing on items that cannot be easily produced at retail locations

680235 the work fucks you up and you are not even paid properly for it
680236 the strike wont go on for too long they have to fulfil our demands we blockade the freight traffic of the whole country even of some of the neighbouring countries the big industrial areas depend on us
680237 last year they negotiated and signed a contract without asking us and the contract was shit they are in process of negotiating for five months now but this time we are watching them closely
680238 to walk out is the only way to enforce our demands
680239 we are hundreds of strikers here they should come here and negotiate with us they have the space here to do that not behind our backs at some far away location
680240 it doesn t really bother us if they don t report about us anyway what is important is that here everything keeps being at stand still in the end the country will take notice of the blockade
680241 at some point the management all left the table saying right we will meet again in front of the court we will check whether the strike is legal at all thats it for us now we dont want to waste our time they said that they have made plans for the weekend that they will take a trip to the delta of river danube go fishing
680242 do you know what guys on monday we will turn up and change our demands as well we will keep up the demand of a 700 hike but not 700 ron we talk about 700 euro
680243 if we had continued the strike for one or two more days they would have faltered and eventually given in to all our demands but what can you do there were only about fifty of us willing to continue the others got scared or maybe didnt believe any more that we could win
680244 we could have got more but in the last few days we were lacking cohesion too many were satisfied with the result

680247 tuhan yang menciptakan kita tuhan yang menciptakan bumi dan langit tuhan yang menciptakan siang dan malam
680248 berani beraninya engkau berkata dengan tuhan seperti itu engkau sungguh telah melecehkan tuhan sumpal ucapanmu dan jangan sekali kali engkau berkata seperti itu lagi nanti tuhan mengutuk semua orang di muka bumi ini karena dosamu
680249 apakah kamu pikir tuhan itu manusia sehingga butuh sepatu pakaian dan minum susu serta yang lainnya
680250 tidak tuhan itu maha sempurna dia tidak membutuhkan apa pun
680251 apa yang membuatmu harus mengusik ketenangan ku engkau telah menyakiti orang yang mencintai dan setia dengan ku
680252 apakah engkau lupa kalau engkau diutus untuk menyatukan pencinta dan sang kekasih bukan untuk menceraiberaikan
680253 ingatlah sesungguhnya orang yang terikat sopan santun itu sama sekali tidak sama dengan orang yang diikat oleh cinta orang yang mencinta tidak mengetahui agama kecuali sang kekasih itu sendiri
680254 allah swt telah berpesan kepadaku bahwa engkau bebas untuk berbicara apa saja dengan tuhan mu tidak perlu lagi ada sopan santun engkau boleh berbicara apa saja dengan cara yang engkau sukai
680255 dan aku minta maaf karena kebodohanku ternyata apa yang aku kira menghujat itu akidah dan cinta adalah yang dapat menyelamatkan dunia

680266 ahmadiyah sect is really misleading if it is still a part of islam the assessment does not only come from the indonesian council of ulemas but also other countries
680267 just open its book and read the basic principle of the sect it is written that ahmadiyah believers are tasked with spreading the teachings of their leader mirza ghulam ahmad
680268 ahmadiyah was already banned by the government a long time ago because its teachings go against the main religious tenets of islam
680269 if ahmadiyah claims its teachings to not be a part of islam there will be no problem but if it continues to claim its teachings are a part of islam it is totally unjustified
680270 because the 18th century was fond of personifying abstractions corruption has seized the provinces etc and because carlyle carried that further and gave us a tinge of poetry in his french revolution whence it passed into every writer who wants to write impressively on poetical and historical subjects we have now reached a stage at which causes movements tendencies etc are talked of as if they were real things who did things as if it were bolshevism not bolsheviks who fomented revolutions and the revolutionary spirit instead of the revolutionary spirits which made men drunk

680275 i was in our back room after you left yesterday and came across an order with your name on it dating back to april 19th in our computer it looks as though you have picked up the wine 6 btls 2004 varner pinot noir in july of this year
680276 i guess what i want to say is that some things and people changed me here but i know that the things i want havent changed and i sometimes feel i still dont know what to do with my life probably thats why i try and do a lot of things here be it mediocre shallow tasking or serious because im searching for what i want or im trying to do these trivialities because im filling up something empty and hoping it would become an overflowing bucket of happiness
680277 i felt like we were one of the top five cars again in race practice friday
680278 we switched to qualifying setup and just missed it a bit and didnt have a good qualifying lap for the race on sunday i think that we can bring a lot from what we learned here in june
680279 we had a great car it was the dominant car here at pocono that weekend i think we brought some good data back with us and think that well have a good car
680280 i feel like we have as good a shot to win as anybody out here
680281 i think we have a great car great team weve been running really well and have had some great races some tough races i think pocono is one of our better tracks this year and think that we have a really good chance at making the chase
680282 thats the main goal thats what all the teams want to do for their sponsors and owners and the employees that work on these cars out of the 14 drivers in contention for the chase i think that we have as good a shot as anyone from sixth on back
680283 we have some different people in place at gillett evernham motorsports and we have a better starting point this year our testing has been great i think we have a great test team that does a lot for our team now i feel that everything that they work on is much better than last year
680284 its good for a driver good for the team and good for the people back in the shop
680285 i think winning races and running up front is as much of a confidence and momentum builder that you can have in racing

680291 what seemed extravagant in 2004 when we decided to go for renewables now seems to have been a very good decision
680292 when you have a programme like this there is no need for nuclear power
680293 countries that do not invest in renewables will pay a high price in future the cost of inaction is very high indeed the perception that renewable energy is very expensive is changing every day as the oil price goes up
680294 juraban que una taza de infusi n de azafr n aliviaba la melancol a una bolsita llena de azafr n que colgara del cuello y se moviera encima del coraz n encender a el amor
680295 para que sus comidas fueran tan fragantes y bellas como todo lo dem s en sus vidas el acto de comer se transformar a en un ardor casi religioso
680296 en el uso del azafr n se revela claramente la diferencia de temperamento de los cretenses y los egipcios pues los primeros lo empleaban por su encanto huidizo y refinado mientras que para los egipcios ten a un significado m s permanente y valioso
680297 adorar el azafr n era tan perjudicial como consentir a un ni o pues con un tratamiento tan suave sin adversidades que reforzaran su naturaleza el car cter de la flor se volv a l nguido y perd a muchos de sus atributos

680303 this small bedroom project then somehow managed to gain the attention of my record company who wanted to hear what i had been doing
680304 after lots of eerrrrs and aarrrgghs i sheepishly took them my music to listen to i was shocked when they said they wanted to release the whole album
680305 one thing lead to another and they the record company finally after many phone calls and emails decided that they wouldnt release it very confusing
680306 so i set about trying to release it myself spending lots of time researching phoning mailing it was a challenge very tiring but hugely rewarding and educational
680307 the teenage cancer trust provide a valuable service to young sufferers of cancer being around people of a similar age whilst undergoing difficult treatment must be a huge help and a comforting factor during the whole process
680308 were very pleased that by doing something so simple as the gig at the royal albert hall and donating prizes to be raffled more facilities can be built throughout the uk to help other teenagers like ben
680309 weve got some great prizes and i hope to get some more now i am after something signed by roger daltrey
680310 people should come and help raise money because all the profits will go directly to the teenage cancer trust ward at st jamess hospital so its a good local cause

680316 the blue crab commercial fishery likely faces the same economic threats rising fuel prices and competition from foreign imports as other commercial fisheries
680317 crabbers cant afford the fuel and expenses almost all have found other jobs there used to be hundreds of crabbers with their own boats now there arent enough crabs for them to pay their fuel bills
680318 in the late 1980s we had to start importing labor from mexico
680319 theres been too much pollution and maybe overfishing theres been too much development and farm runoff core sound is an outstanding resource water i dont want to lose it

680321 how could you be thinking about that dalton is gone
680322 wait a minute mindi you never told me it was a lever action

680324 well if thats true lets just call them right now and find out
680325 every course is unique but weve had four two week training camps here
680326 weve prepared to the gold standard we have good technical paddlers and they are performing extremely well
680327 ive been to the games before so i know a little bit about how it all works
680328 what we need to do is practise as many different variations of gate positions and what we think are going to be the feature moves in all the main sections because the course is only set the evening before and come race day we dont get to practise it at all
680329 in athens i didnt really come close to taking a spot in the team but in the last few years ive really come on
680330 i am not really in awe of it although i am very excited to be out here ive come off the back of a successful year ive done two major world races and picked up a medal at each of those
680331 that is filled with funny stories that you dont have to be a christian to laugh at anyway the jist of this series is that joy is the one attribute that draws people towards you
680332 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
680333 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
680334 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
680335 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
680336 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
680337 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
680338 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
680339 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
680340 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
680341 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
680342 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
680343 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
680344 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
680345 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
680346 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
680347 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign
680348 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi

680351 about powers other than reason i would be sorry if you mistook my position opposition to the anthroposophy of rudolf steiner not one is more convinced than i that reason is utterly inadequate to the richness and spirituality of real things indeed this is itself a deliverance of reason nor do i doubt the presence even in us of faculties embryonic or atrophied that lie in an indefinite margin around the little finite bit of focus which is intelligence faculties anticipating or remembering the possession of huge tracts of reality that slip through the meshes of the intellect and to be sure i believe that the symbols presented by imagination at its height are the workings of that fringe and present to us as much of the super intelligible reality as we can get while we retain our present form of consciousness my scepticism begins when people offer me explicit accounts of the super intelligible and in so doing use all the categories of the intellect at all events if more knowledge is to come it must be the wordless amp thoughtless knowledge of the mystic not the celestial statistics of swedenborg the lemurian history of steiner or the demonology of the platonists all this seems to me merely an attempt to know the super intelligible as if it were a new slice of the intelligible as though a man with a bad cold tried to get back smells with a microscope

680357 la corte no tiene nada que negociar con el gobierno la corte no puede negociar sus decisiones y tiene que mantener la independencia
680358 esta no es la oportunidad para proponer ese tipo de reformas especialmente cuando tocan a tribunales que vienen haciendo bien su tarea
680359 esos temas se pueden discutir pero en un ambiente distinto no es en este momento cuando la corte suprema de justicia viene haciendo su tarea como la tiene que hacer

680365 you must picture me alone in that room in magdalen night after night feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second my work the steady unrelenting approach of him whom i so earnestly desired not to meet that which i greatly feared had at last come upon me in the trinity term of 1929 i gave in and admitted that god was god and knelt and prayed perhaps that night the more dejected and reluctant convert in all england i did not then see what is now the most shining and obvious thing the divine humility which will accept a convert even on such terms the prodigal son at least walked home on his own feet but who can duly adore that love which will open the high gates to a prodigal who is brought in kicking struggling resentful and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance of escape the words compelle intrare citing vg luke 14 23 compel them to come in compel them to come in have been so abused by wicked men that we shudder at them but properly understood they plumb the depth of the divine mercy the hardness of god is kinder than the softness of men and his compulsion is our liberation
680366 people in search of criminal records had to hire private investigators to navigate byzantine courthouses and rudimentary filing or computer systems and to deal with often grim faced legal clerks in a way the obstacles to getting criminal information maintained a valuable ignorance fueled civil peace convicts could start fresh after serving their time without strangers knowing their pasts and there was little risk that unsophisticated researchers could confuse people with identical names

680385 this facebook group is emerging as a new business source we also make all sorts of interesting industry connections and referral opportunities where were able to team up with different organizations
680386 for example if you launched your identity on facebook as your companys name i think youd be in violation on the terms of service because youd be posing as someone else

680407 as banks and financial institutions seek to differentiate their online banking offerings we are seeing that web 2 0 technologies making a real impact on how these typically traditional organizations can do business
680408 there is a greater pressure on banks to explore new business models that meet evolving customer demands and requirements and being able to use diverse tools such as personalized homepages social networks rss and gives financial services firms a significant advantage as long as they meet strict corporate security and governance requirements
680409 banks and financial institutions are currently trying to prune the cost of customer support as well as enhance the level of promotion of new services to small business and corporate customers and web 2 0 technology is able to satisfy both these needs with much higher degrees of business interaction which increases the likelihood customers will do more business with their existing institution
680410 celents report concludes quite rightly that whilst business banking online services provide a raft of services they look and feel out of date and are not what todays customers are really after in the web 2 0 driven e business world
680411 banks have been holding back from embracing web 2 0 technology and its attendant advantages because of uncertainty on how to implement these solutions with enterprise grade security
680412 as more banks move to the web 2 0 environment the rest of the industry will follow

680437 so far no organisation has claimed responsibility for the bombs planted in surat the authenticity of the indian mujahideen images which has sent an e mail to a media agency before the blasts in ahmedabad is yet to be ascertained
680438 it is possible that the group which may be responsible for the blasts in ahmedabad images and planting of bombs in surat belongs to a new generation of terrorist groups
680439 it could also be simi images working under a new identity these facts need to be ascertained

680456 today we showed the worth of our team and our drivers but we lacked the total reliability which is absolutely vital felipe drove possibly the best race of his career and we are very disappointed about what happened to him just a handful of kilometres from the end he made an amazing start attacking at the right moment and then he was comfortably managing his race in the final stages heading for a well deserved victory kimis race was compromised by his poor qualifying result yesterday when you start further back its hard to climb up the order he was stuck behind alonso for much of the race but when he finally had a clear track ahead of him he showed all his and the f2008s potential we have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as well prepared as possible for the european grand prix
680457 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever i am very frustrated at the moment because today we had a great car and we had done everything perfectly until just a few kilometres from the finish unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
680458 i am sorry for felipe and for the team as it is horrible to lose a race in this way it was tough for me because when you spend a long time behind a slower car it becomes frustrating and boring when i was finally able to push the car was behaving very well but by then it was too late i came up behind glock but in the end i had to slow as i had a mechanical problem with the rear end and the team told me to be very careful to ensure i brought the car home its true that im the one who has won the most points out of the top three in the classification which shows this championship is really unpredictable with ups and downs for everyone it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result we must try and fix the problems we have in qualifying to start at the front so as to exploit the potential of the car if we can do that then we can get back to fighting for the win
680459 saya diperintah oleh rasul untuk mengqadla puasa dan tidak diperinath untuk mengqadla shalat
680460 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe hard and it worked i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
680461 congratulations to heikki for his first and very well deserved grand prix win the race could have been better for me my start was okay but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
680462 one of the oldest motor racing phrases ever coined is to finish first first you have to finish
680463 lewiss race was compromised by his losing the lead at the start but we fuelled him long for the second stint and therefore believed he was well placed to leapfrog felipe in his final pitstop sadly for him though it wasnt to be damage to his front left tyre cost him that victory chance however from lewiss perspective as bad days go it could have been a lot worse but today was heikkis day and a very good day it was and everyone at vodafone mclaren mercedes is absolutely delighted for him
680464 we fought hard today and we were on the pace with a car that was working well which is encouraging for the rest of the championship we scored some important points which is satisfying even though we could have maybe been on the podium we must now continue working hard but todays result shows that we are moving in the right direction
680465 i am happy with my result this weekend i scored some valuable points which is promising for the rest of the season i made a good start but unfortunately i made a small mistake on the first lap which meant that i lost the two positions that i had made up it shows that at this level you cannot afford to make the smallest error i am continuing to learn and i am determined to continue building on this progress when we go to valencia at the end of the month
680466 todays result is a solid and encouraging one for the whole team our two drivers did a great job and we are now ready to continue pushing hard in the second half of the season to finish in fourth place in the constructors championship
680467 there have been two sides to this weekend it got off to a good start and then i had some problems in qualifying the race also started quite well as i had a good pace then it all went to hell at the first pit stop as the guys had to use the fire extinguisher and i got a lot of foam on my visor it happened again at the second stop and this time i had foam inside and outside my visor and couldnt see a thing so had to make another stop to get it cleaned by this stage we had lost so much time there was nothing else to do and i preferred to make the extra stop as the lack of visibility was dangerous
680468 i didnt have a very good pit stop and that caused the engine to overheat and that messed up some parts and i had no choice but to retire its a shame as i had a good pace from the car this afternoon i made a mistake in running wide at the last corner on the first lap and lost a lot of places i was stuck behind barrichello and it was impossible to overtake this hasnt been a good weekend and that goes back to friday when i suffered reliability problems and then came the disappointment this afternoon
680469 there can be no excuses this was a bad weekend for the whole team
680470 volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice
680471 queremos lanzar un anteproyecto de ley para que sea sometido a discusi n de los distintos sectores involucrados
680472 nunca se vio desde la recuperaci n de la democracia hasta ahora un nivel de virulencia de lockout patronal y cortes que impidieron el abastecimiento originaron suspensiones de f bricas y hasta escenas de pugilato sobre las rutas hubo escraches a legisladores y a sus familiares la virulencia no fue por parte del gobierno no hab a ning n funcionario cortando rutas de nuestro lado todo fue manejado institucionalmente evitando cualquier episodio de violencia
680473 cuando se sancion la actual ley de radiodifusi n durante la dictadura lo m s moderno que exist a en la argentina era la televisi n a color ni siquiera hab a fax la realidad requiere de un instrumento que d cuenta no s lo de las demandas de pluralidad y de actuaci n de todos los sectores culturales comunitarios p blicos y privados sino tambi n preparar el marco regulatorio para la incorporaci n de la tecnolog a tenemos que recurrir a una legislaci n comparada no vamos a inventar nada nuevo en un mundo donde ya se ha trabajado mucho
680474 estamos trabajando y hay much simos instrumentos la cgt ha planteado otros pero una asignaci n universal familiar o de cualquier tipo tiene que tener los recursos para ser pagada si no se convierte en un discurso demag gico que tanto han ayudado a descreer en la pol tica
680475 esto comienza a presionar sobre los precios internos porque se quiere tener un mayor excedente exportable por parte de aquellos que producen los alimentos para poder ganar m s dinero
680476 no podemos volver a ser un granero del mundo sin valor agregado tenemos que reindustrializar el pa s
680477 yo siempre digo que con la plata del estado todos son socialistas esos son fondos tributarios que el estado toma de todos sus contribuyentes los que tienen trabajo los que no los que tienen plata los que no el problema es ser un poco m s distributivo como lo hacen en otras sociedades m s modernas desarrolladas y progresistas all la renta de aquellos sectores que tienen un mayor nivel de rentabilidad se distribuye hacia los sectores que menos tienen
680478 tal vez la lecci n o la autocr tica que deber a hacerme es cierto grado de ingenuidad ante la afectaci n de lo que yo considero son privilegios
680479 esta es una discusi n que podr retardarse demorarse o fracasar en una instancia legislativa pero que necesariamente deber ser retomada como un instrumento de pol tica econ mica
680480 se ha disparado una discusi n que va a seguir porque el problema del modelo econ mico de la concentraci n de la riqueza de un mundo cada vez m s complicado por los alimentos y energ a va a exigir a las autoridades sea esta presidenta o el que venga instrumentos muy importantes

680483 my start was normal i was on the outside going into turn one but then i had to go a little bit wide and dropped back a place then the problems started on the third lap when my brakes started to overheat particularly the rear ones and i had to move my brake balance forward from that point on i had problems with lots of locking on the front and understeer and it was difficult to handle the car considering this my race pace was not bad in the first stint but then in the second stint i was held up by the group in front when i was quite light and lost some time there in the final stint i had a puncture on the front right under braking and then the brakes gave up and my race was over overall i am disappointed because weve worked hard for the whole weekend and then after three laps we have a problem so i couldnt show the performance i wanted to
680484 it was a tough race as we were fighting quite a lot we were quite heavy at the beginning of the race but the pace really wasnt too bad and i could keep up with the others in front of me in fact the two williams were only two laps heavier than me when i was just behind them but i was keeping the same pace even at the end of the race in the last few laps i could do a 1min 22 6 which is a good lap time in terms of strategy we did well that was the maximum we could get from this race we just need a step forward for the next few races
680485 an exciting race for our guys with both driving very good races under the circumstances giancarlo lost a position at the start but both drove good first stints we put them on slightly different strategies with a short middle stint for adrian and a longer one for giancarlo we were able to jump some people in the pit stops with giancarlo and although he just wasnt able to hold it in the final pit stop at least we were able to race with the group in front adrian had a brake problem very early on which meant we had to wind his brake balance forward and ultimately he had to stop with a puncture caused by this brake failure while its disappointing not to get two cars to the finish we can be pleased with the teams performance and both the drivers who all pushed very hard this weekend

680489 taubat adalah melakukan enam hal atas segala dosa yang pernah dikerjakan yakni menyesali kesalahannya mengqadhai kewajiban yang pernah ditinggalkannya mengembalikan hak orang lain meminta maaf kepada orang yang disalahi memiliki komitmen untuk tidak mengulangi kesalahan dan mendidik dirinya untuk selalu taat kepada allah sebagai ia mendidik dirinya untuk bermaksiat kepada nya

680533 se ha solicitado repetidamente por parte de la conferencia episcopal que la iglesia de tarso que se ha convertido ahora en un museo sea concedida a todos los peregrinos cristianos que llegan a esta localidad
680534 se nos ha hecho distintas promesas pero hasta ahora solo se nos ha concedido colocar una cruz dentro del edificio museo y no cobrarle la entrada a los grupos que previamente avisan de su llegada me parece francamente un poco irrespetuosa esta actitud dado lo expresado por distintas autoridades locales y nacionales

680558 im patriotic and support our troops and everything but i dont think its right for them to play it that loud
680559 it blew me away when the bugle sounded and cars continued to drive past me while i was standing at attention
680560 when the first note of the national anthem is played military members in uniform will stop face the flag or music and render the appropriate salute until the last note is played
680561 concerned that the music could not be heard very well on base proper
680562 i have figured it out my hair looks like gilda radners
680563 your hair does not look like gilda p your have grew 1 32 of an inch and you say this stuff
680564 i look like an onion head pull an onion up out of the ground turn it upside down and this is what youve got

680567 professor meyers needs to be disciplined if not fired by the university board of regents for his unnecessary provocative and inflammatory actions directed against christians
680568 had professor myers engaged in similar such egregious acts like burning a homosexual flag or painting swastikas on a synagogue or burning books in front of the library he would have been terminated on the spot because meyers merely offended christians he goes unpunished this reinforces the perception of hostility towards christians on secular university campuses and brings disgrace on the university itself for condoning this provocation by their silence
680569 when they start to lift it theyll look to see where the stress points are where its cracking and where the building starts to separate
680570 theyll stop and go back in for a week or so to brace it and do whatever needs to be done

680573 it is one of the essential ingredients in the success of our marriage
680574 every time that we come against a challenge we turn to the tools we have learned and a solution follows
680575 the offer comes at a time when blake is very much on amys mind things still need to be worked out but if she does the gig she will hand the fee straight to blake who should be free soon afterwards
680576 kim knew how much the project meant to heath he released the funds to finish construction
680577 kate is keen to have another baby before lila grace gets any older she doesnt want her to grow up a single child
680578 lila even calls sadie frosts little girl iris her sister because she wants one so much which has made kate feel guilty but it has become a real sticking point between her and jamie
680579 she thinks he will be a great dad but he has been unsure whether hes ready for such a huge commitment
680580 as long as my daughter is happy and healthy it is what it is
680581 she really isnt the puppet that people make her out to be she has an opinion and shes a very very bright girl shes a pleasure to work with you wont find any diva behavior in there
680582 shes a very very sweet person takes direction very well
680583 i cant say that shes guarded but i understand why she doesnt want to talk about certain things and i respect that about her
680584 im not going to let this put a damper on my day
680585 id like to thank the good lord for making me a yankee
680586 the game is the game and whatever happens during the game is kind of fun its not taken too seriously and its kind of a light nature the introductions before mean a lot especially to some of the old time players who didnt get the recognition as we do now with television coverage and the internet
680587 my arm is tofu you know what that is its a soft rice bean cake
680588 this is my first one and its something different to be able to play with all of your teammates and enjoy a special day this is the last time ill ever play in this ballpark and this is one of the oldest ballparks that ill ever play in so its an honor to be invited back
680589 you know the day is going to come but you want them to kick you out
680590 you play baseball together and you grow so close i remember walking in the tunnel as an opposing player for the first time and you see the rich history to pitch here in front of the fans you never know whats going to happen i still love it
680591 these men still have pride to wear pinstripes in this day and age
680592 you can only clap for the fans because theyve been such a huge part of it through the years theres been so much history here that even when this place closes i dont know if there will ever be a ballpark that has the memories that this place has right here
680593 its a sad day i always get sad every year when i remember the date
680594 we didnt get through it i know we had to finish the season but we had been talking about how we were going to make a comeback like we did in 78 when we lost thurman it took it out of us
680595 i have great memories of this ballpark but its time to move on
680596 theyre moving on to a bigger and better place new york isnt like anywhere else and they deserve it for their fans
680597 i dont think they had any idea that i wasnt actually taking a picture of them because of who they are
680598 jeez what an ego if they had simply asked me nicely i couldve given a simple explanation and very probably wouldve handed over the roll of film
680599 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
680600 youd be surprised mr conway age is a limit we impose upon ourselves

680603 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
680604 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
680605 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
680606 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
680607 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded

680613 seeking script ideas for a film based on the classic television series which spanned more than 150 episodes between 1959 and 1964
680614 ultimately i felt inspired by him and i dont think anyone in our generation has had that experience
680615 it comes down to a simple choice for all of us if you like the direction the country is going you should vote for mccain but if you want a candidate who rejects those policies but has a vision then obamas your guy
680616 the monks also observe a high number of fast days each year they seldom eat meat and they cultivate their own wines fruit and vegetables
680617 despite their average venerable age the 2 000 monks living in 20 ancient monasteries have virtually no heart disease no cardiac arrests and no strokes a zero incidence of alzheimers disease which astonished the researchers conducting the various studies and unusually low rates of cancer which in the case of prostate cancer is 4 times lower than the international average the latter finding is even more remarkable when you know that the monks in that particular investigation were aged between 50 and 104 their rates of lung bowel and bladder cancer are zero
680618 i live on the outskirts of the village of mayfield in east sussex
680619 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
680620 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
680621 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
680622 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
680623 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
680624 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
680625 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
680626 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
680627 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
680628 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
680629 it was made into a bad movie in the 1970s starring the admirable george c scott
680630 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
680631 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
680632 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described
680633 it used to have a four cylinder flathead chrysler diesel engine but someone replaced it with a v8 general motors gasoline car engine it turned the boat into a virtual bomb it looked like a bucket of rusty bolts so i sent some guys to move it to a good boatyard
680634 it was 12 knots on a boat which was not seaworthy after a nine hour journey we navigated in by torchlight to the new yard
680635 we will then take her to an undisclosed location and protect her like an unborn child
680636 but it means that you will see 27m of the 32m on the screen there are certain things that are meant to be and if youre lucky enough in life to eventually get there then that is a great achievement this is the project that is meant to be for me
680637 i put a lot of myself in to those roles
680638 in the valley of elah was an important film because we were looking at how the iraq war impacts on local communities across america with the loss of family members its a tragedy that carries on
680639 he is so focused tommy never wants to waste time and sometimes we were having a bit too much fun for him
680640 my belief is that we should never waste a day
680641 and when you are working and acting is our work there should be total concentration on what you are trying to achieve anything less than that then you are cheating yourself and short changing others
680642 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
680643 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
680644 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
680645 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
680646 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
680647 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
680648 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different
680649 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
680650 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
680651 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
680652 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
680653 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
680654 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
680655 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
680656 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
680657 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
680658 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
680659 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
680660 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
680661 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
680662 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
680663 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
680664 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
680665 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
680666 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
680667 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
680668 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
680669 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
680670 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
680671 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
680672 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
680673 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
680674 we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
680675 some obama backers are right to worry the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
680676 these types of campaigns which the media often helps todrive as it analyses the effectiveness of the attacks before questioning the accuracy of theinformation will continue from now until election day on november 4
680677 and its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
680678 there is some evidence that the balance of enthusiasm has shifted and that young people who seemed to turn out and vote for senator obama in unusually high numbers in the primaries and caucuses are no longer so enthusiastic about him
680679 i think they are cynical and want to distract people from talking about the real issues
680680 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia
680681 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
680682 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
680683 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
680684 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
680685 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
680686 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
680687 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
680688 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
680689 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
680690 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
680691 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
680692 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
680693 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
680694 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
680695 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
680696 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
680697 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
680698 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
680699 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
680700 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
680701 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
680702 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
680703 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
680704 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
680705 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
680706 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
680707 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
680708 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
680709 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm

680719 david braben founder of frontier lost winds thrillville has some interesting ideas that developers can use to avoid consumers from trading in their games to get newer ones
680720 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
680721 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
680722 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
680723 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
680724 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
680725 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
680726 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
680727 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
680728 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
680729 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
680730 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
680731 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
680732 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
680733 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
680734 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
680735 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
680736 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
680737 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
680738 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
680739 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
680740 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
680741 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
680742 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
680743 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
680744 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
680745 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
680746 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
680747 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
680748 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
680749 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
680750 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
680751 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
680752 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
680753 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
680754 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
680755 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
680756 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
680757 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
680758 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
680759 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
680760 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
680761 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
680762 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
680763 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
680764 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
680765 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
680766 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
680767 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
680768 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
680769 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
680770 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
680771 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
680772 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
680773 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
680774 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
680775 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
680776 a grand salon a throwback to new york of old
680777 ask the average guy if he knows or has heard of rubin chances are he has but not rattner
680778 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
680779 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
680780 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
680781 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
680782 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
680783 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
680784 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
680785 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
680786 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
680787 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
680788 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
680789 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
680790 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
680791 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
680792 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
680793 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
680794 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
680795 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
680796 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
680797 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
680798 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
680799 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
680800 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
680801 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
680802 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
680803 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
680804 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
680805 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
680806 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
680807 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
680808 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
680809 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
680810 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
680811 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
680812 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
680813 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
680814 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
680815 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
680816 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
680817 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
680818 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
680819 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
680820 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
680821 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
680822 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
680823 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
680824 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
680825 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
680826 there is scarcely anything in the world that some man cannot make a little worse and sell a little more cheaply the person who buys on price alone is this mans lawful prey
680827 we didnt buy the fallout franchise to just do fallout 3 and then stop but lets get this one out of the door before we worry about the next one

680830 when sony first announced that the playstation 3 would be able to run linux natively a great deal of excitement ensued early on it was a bit of a challenge to get linux natively installed the supported installer ran a custom script that hand mangled a fedora core 5 or 6 install dvd into a runnable system with a special ps3 kernel people put in hours and hours of effort to get other systems such as ubuntu working terrasofts yellow dog linux with an actual graphical installer that ran on the ps3 was the king of the hill time has passed and a great deal has changed fedora 7 installs on the ps3 out of the box with the most challenging parts being selecting the ps3 storage driver so it can find the install dvd and remembering to specify a video mode on the initial install command line so youll be able to see the installer so you can run linux on the ps3 its easy the problem is it doesnt necessarily run well if you picked the ps3 up as a cheap cell development system its a little frustrating to discover that having followed the default install procedure you have a system that comes up with a hundred megs or more of swap in use by the time you get to a shell prompt

680859 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
680860 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
680861 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
680862 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
680863 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
680864 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
680865 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
680866 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
680867 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
680868 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
680869 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
680870 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
680871 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
680872 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
680873 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
680874 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
680875 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
680876 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
680877 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
680878 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
680879 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
680880 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
680881 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
680882 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
680883 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
680884 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
680885 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
680886 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
680887 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
680888 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
680889 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
680890 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
680891 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
680892 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
680893 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
680894 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
680895 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
680896 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
680897 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
680898 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
680899 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
680900 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
680901 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
680902 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
680903 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
680904 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
680905 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
680906 tv is trash we dont have magazines or newspapers in the house either
680907 our collective kids now outnumber the band more than two to one
680908 theyre never allowed to block a fire hydrant but they do it
680909 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
680910 mccains 2000 campaign was so tech savvy that it scared me it was the whole reason i started focusing on the tech stuff for the democrats
680911 i am an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that i can get
680912 demonstrated admirable restraint and respect for obama in the last few weeks
680913 mccain has drawn a bright line and said thats unacceptable
680914 its a genuine reflex he really wants the campaign to be civil
680915 he didnt have a problem calling mitt romney a phony in new hampshire or comparing george w bush to bill clinton in south carolina in 2000
680916 mccain is a tough guy hell do whatever he needs to do
680917 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
680918 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
680919 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
680920 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
680921 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
680922 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
680923 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
680924 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
680925 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
680926 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
680927 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
680928 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
680929 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
680930 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
680931 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
680932 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan

680934 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
680935 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
680936 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
680937 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
680938 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
680939 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
680940 antes de los partidos hemos mirado al rival y les hemos explicado a los jugadores lo que hacen del chivas estamos esperando alg n dvd que a estas alturas s bado por la tarde en chicago a n no nos ha llegado tenemos pocas referencias
680941 pep jug en m xico y sabe la forma con que juegan los conjuntos mexicanos
680942 es uno de los equipos fuertes de m xico un rival complicado con un tipo de temperatura que posiblemente le puede favorecer
680943 tenemos que afrontar este partido con la idea de que la gente vaya cogiendo minutos y la preparaci n f sica necesaria para llegar a la previa de la champions bien
680944 es verdad que llegamos un poco cargados con el viaje y los entrenamientos la gente est un poco justa en estos momentos
680945 la idea es que todo el mundo juegue 45 minutos si no tenemos lesiones no queremos llegar a la previa con desgaste
680946 de este equipo al que queremos ver m s adelante a n se tienen que mejorar muchas cosas
680947 solid choice and certainly one of the top frameworks available today
680948 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
680949 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
680950 you know its not about you its about your country
680951 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
680952 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
680953 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue
680954 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
680955 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
680956 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
680957 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
680958 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
680959 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
680960 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
680961 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
680962 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
680963 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
680964 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
680965 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
680966 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
680967 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
680968 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
680969 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
680970 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
680971 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
680972 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
680973 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
680974 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
680975 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
680976 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
680977 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
680978 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
680979 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
680980 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
680981 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
680982 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
680983 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
680984 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
680985 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
680986 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
680987 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
680988 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
680989 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
680990 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
680991 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
680992 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
680993 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
680994 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
680995 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
680996 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
680997 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
680998 quien con ni os se acuesta no s lo se levanta como dice el refr n sino que adem s te pueden haber nacionalizado un banco

681000 ya la poca de los autoritaritas golpes de estado cumpli una etapa y no tiene en este momento nueva presencia en nuestra historia le presente es de la democracia y de cosas que ya no vamos a renuncias a nuestra libertad a determinar nuestro destinos de educar a nuestros hijos

681089 parker and birdlebough said they needed something new and unusual and wanted us to come up with something that was going to sell wine
681090 we had some bulk wine that we didnt know what to do with and they came up with a name found the artist and even told us how much we should sell it for
681091 the first year we produced 3 000 cases which was a tremendous amount for us
681092 and we sold out of that wine in three months we did another bottling and sold out of that in three months
681093 we have always strived to make sure we are putting the very best wine in so people are not only pleased with the bottle but whats inside
681094 its allowed me to create my winemaker select series of wines
681095 the wines have been so well received and usually sell out very quickly and its been so much fun for me to get to experiment and play
681096 the winery was designed to produce a maximum of 10 000 cases and we were pushing 32 000

681141 it sends the message that it is ok to pull out a knife and stab someone this is outrageous
681142 there used to be a saying that the gun was a form of communication id say its definitely knives now

681148 hes not quite six foot and hes probably 15 stone id say i was pretty close to my son
681149 he wasnt really into sports hes more into playing on the computer and things like that
681150 we used to talk over the phone or wed meet in the street or go car racing im into racing cars and hes always been there as my pit crew
681151 in this case what police are investigating is that he has died unusually or unexpectedly after attending a party all detectives can say is hed been at a party and had been drinking
681152 it will devastate any small country town and its bound to be quite devastating for virtually everyone
681153 you will find that everyone knew him in some way or another
681154 we unfortunately have a culture among many young people to drink to get drunk and many people believe the more you drink the more popular you will be
681155 but there is no way that someone as young as 15 should be consuming alcohol in these amounts and we need to get that message across
681156 you might have been informed that we planned to support malefice on their upcoming uk tour in september but were very sorry to announce that we will not be able to join them on this tour due to financial problems as support act we would not get paid enough money to cover our expenses sad but true we hope you understand and that you might catch us live another time

681179 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
681180 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades

681183 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider

681194 nothing can fully prepare you for discipline problemsuntil they are experienced first hand
681195 on suggestion i do have to offer is to give some kind of training to new teachers and substitutes as well on what kind of real life situations one can expect and practical ways to deal with them i know this would have been extremely helpful for me especially that first week
681196 dont worry i am going to talk to so and so and we will get this resolved
681197 i never lost my head and my teammates did well kept the ball alive so i just gave it a shot and luckily it went in
681198 theyre both quick good with the ball and a handful patrick is one of those guys who sometimes looks unorthodox but thats what makes him difficult to play against you play against him in practice and you never know what hes going to do hes a good young player and he had a great goal
681199 marcos good with the ball hes crafty and as he gets more comfortable with us hes only going to get better
681200 we got a lot of guys that pride themselves on the defensive side of the ball and tonight was no different than any other night
681201 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
681202 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
681203 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer

681207 i believe he is much better now than he was then
681208 those type of kids should be in a school of their own
681209 i would think well strengthen the squad definitely there are always options
681210 its pleasing that we had afonso alves and jonno adam johnson on the bench because in lots of games last year we didnt have impact substitutions to alter games now we have and thats a great thing for us
681211 hibs gave us a really good test it was a good workout for us weve learned a lot from the game we went into it not particularly sharp because weve pushed them this last week that was their second game and we trained hard right through
681212 so from a fitness angle i was pleased some needed 90 minutes but we saw how much we still have to learn in terms of getting our shape right weve come through it but theres a tremendous amount to work at
681213 the way they played caused us a few problems in the first half we were a bit stretched but got better in the second half and we didnt stretch them enough in the first half all our play was in front of them
681214 i was a bit critical of them at half time because im not sure our approach as a team was right but second half we got to grips with it once afonso and jeremie aliadiere started to stretch them and we took our goals well
681215 i know the two clubs are still in communication about a deal
681216 we are waiting to conclude everything and we are waiting on barcelona
681217 celtic are very keen on signing crosas but there is also interest from clubs in spain and clubs in italy
681218 i think it could be a permanent transfer as marc does not want to go on loan again
681219 celtic are a very good possibility for him as they are always challenging for trophies and they also play in the champions league
681220 europe is important the premier league is important the fa cup and the carling cup so we will try to win every trophy and you never know
681221 we will try to win from the first game and then see the situation
681222 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
681223 we started really well and finished really well last season
681224 if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season
681225 but we will be working really hard to be as competitive as we can

681369 why are these senators saying it would take five to ten years and the price impact wouldnt be felt until 2030
681370 well i think that the price would adjust actually as soon as you started drilling it theres a psychology with regard to speculative elements in any commodity market whether its grains or metals or oil and gas if the world really felt that there were plenty of places to go look for oil and gas the markets would start trading as if that were a reality every time we go and find new resources we find there are more than we thought there were
681371 the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 in the ocs access case is projected to be 1 6 percent higher than in the reference case and 3 percent higher in 2030 alone at 5 6 million barrels per day for the lower 48 ocs annual crude oil production in 2030 is projected to be 7 percent higher 2 4 million barrels per day in the ocs access case compared with 2 2 million barrels per day in the reference case figure 20 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
681372 any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
681373 peterson let me give you a hypothetical senator what would or should we do if in the post june 30th period a so called sovereign iraqi government asks us to leave even if we are unhappy about the security situation there i understand its a hypothetical but its at least possible mccain well if that scenario evolves then i think its obvious that we would have to leave because if it was an elected government of iraq and weve been asked to leave other places in the world if it were an extremist government then i think we would have other challenges but i dont see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the iraqi government over to the iraqi people peterson a second and final question from me as you know mccain by the way could i if we do it right thats not going to happen but we will be there militarily for a long long long time
681374 we aspire to reach to the 18th province before the end of this year god willing all provinces will be under the control of the iraqi security authorities before the end of this year
681375 i have also consistently said that once were in that we had to be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in because once you get in now youve got to make sure that our troops are safe youve got to make sure that the country doesnt collapse and so what ive called for is a phased withdraw a phased redeployment that is not precipitous that is responsibly getting out combat troops out at a pace of about 1 2 brigades per month and at that point we would have our troops out our combat troops out in about 16 months now assuming that i take office in january then that means that we would have our we would still have our troops there for about 2 more years from now so when i hear john mccain saying we cant surrender we cant wave the white flag nobodys talking about surrendering were talking about common sense we can not be there forever we cant be there for 50 years we cant afford it our military families cant bear that burden weve got to get more troops into afghanistan i am going to bring this war to an end so dont be confused i will bring the iraq war to a close when i am president of the us of america
681376 it strikes me as unlikely that thats their real reason
681377 these other justifications are opening the door to do what they really want
681378 the laws of gravity have been scientifically proven where as morality has grey areas and cannot ultimately be perscibed universally
681379 i think the fact dawkins in all his programs and interviews seem to emphasize to people and tell them that it is so obvious with the ludicrousness of religion and interviews people who believe in ghosts and so on and try to reason with them as to show the nonsensicalness
681380 another problem is the way dawkins is calling people towards atheism the fact that science is a logical way to approach things and it is but calling people towards atheism in such a manner can turn atheism into something more organized and having something more organized can lead to a complacency in thinking and fall into all the traps religion have fallen into but nnot as much worse the way dawkins has categorized atheism and what it is and the role of it he has made it seem as so if someone was to question science they would be shot down i think the scientific method should be open to criticism and people like dawkins should advocate rather than make it the absolute position in ones thinking
681381 the most obvious level is the modern disappearance of god as collective murder a little behind comes the collective murder of the pagan gods as the generative power behind their existence and way behind the most difficult level of all is the passion of jesus that cannot be the death of the christian god if the murders of the gods are always their birth but that could well be the death of all other gods in the banal sense we have in mind when we talk pf
681382 a process of imaginative conjectures and empirical refutations advancing the truthlikeness of theories about reality but necessarily in a state of finite knowledge and infinite ignorance
681383 1 the theory that physical matter is the only reality and that everything including thought feeling mind and will can be explained in terms of matter and physical phenomena
681384 by the standard of empirical causality in science thats the best scientific explanation and has the most real meaning
681385 the thesis that religious experiences are merely a hijacked response to concrete situations which stimulate natural cognitive processes is empirically testable and has real meaning whether or not its completely true is certainly debatable
681386 as most of those who founded modern science and philosophy were christians
681387 would have to conclude that there was some sort of designer personally guiding the process
681388 whenever a theory appears to you as the only possible one take this as a sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the problem which it was intended to solve
681389 a process of imaginative conjectures and empirical refutations advancing the truthlikeness of theories about reality but necessarily in a state of finite knowledge and infinite ignorance
681390 in order to recognize an explanation as the best one neednt be able to explain the explanation in fact so requiring would lead to an infinite regress of explanations so that nothing could ever be explained and science would be destroyed so in the case at hand in order to recognize that intelligent design is the best explanation of the appearance of design in the universe one neednt be able to explain the designer
681391 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
681392 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board

681398 massa and lewis hamilton were very quick after the start but about half way through the race i felt it was starting to work for me towards the end i just tried to put pressure on massa and hope that something would happen
681399 everything went fine for me im very happy about it we the whole team have put a massive effort in over the past few months in difficult times we just kept pushing so im very very glad to score the first victory
681400 in the first two stints i was cautious because earlier this year i had problems with tyre degradation i was worried that if i crossed that edge again i might start to struggle so i just kept to my own pace and tried to increase it bit by bit and in the last stint it all worked fine for me
681401 it has been a moment i have been targeting for many years now since i started getting the idea about the possibility to be an formula 1 driver i wanted to improve my fitness and i spent a lot of time to try and achieve this goal and to achieve it is pleasing

681457 siempre nos enfrentamos y adem s la mayor a nos conocemos desde chiquitos que bamos a jugar a las selecciones juveniles as que ya nos conocemos bien
681458 espa a no tuvo la posibilidad de clasificar a los juegos pero hay muchos hinchas del sevilla que me dijeron que quieren que ganemos nosotros por el hecho de jugar ah y la verdad es que eso es algo muy lindo
681459 ya nos conocemos de las divisiones m s juveniles de argentina sub 17 y sub 20 hay muy buena relaci n entre todos y por eso este campeonato se va a hacer m s f cil
681460 se jug bien y se gan que es lo m s importante con un rival que no te regala nada por los jugadores con los que cuenta son circunstancias del partido al idea es esa entrar para aportar por suerte se dio todo para que el equipo siga sumando puntos en el torneo
681461 me sent a gusto con el equipo arrancamos no jugando bien pero despu s supimos sobreponernos de ir en desventaja porque no es f cil ir perdiendo y remontar el marcador por todo esto contento
681462 creo que es justo el marcador porque las que tuvimos las metimos de eso se trata el futbol nosotros nos fijamos solo en nuestro equipo sin importar lo que pase enfrente es la forma de trabajar de nuestra instituci n
681463 salimos muy contentos apenas es la segunda fecha pero yo creo que es un merecido triunfo debido a que cada punto vale oro le sali un golazo de chilena y al ngulo fue un muy bonito gol pero gracias a dios salimos con la victoria
681464 ellos tuvieron el tres a uno que yosgart guti rrez tap bastante bien al final cerramos muy bien el equipo no se desesper y fue contundente para m lo m s rescatable fue que el equipo toma mucha forma y el saber ganar estos partidos
681465 muchas veces se ve uno desesperado porque sin gritos en donde quieres acomodar en algunos ajustes que quieres hacer y se ve como si uno estuviera desesperado pero es realmente para tratar de ajustar en el partido
681466 saber que aunque metamos cinco no somos los mejores ni aunque nos metan cuatro somos los peores estamos conscientes de que dejamos de hacer cosas pero ya hay que levantar la cabeza
681467 esta es una buena lecci n de que tenemos que estar concentrados los noventa minutos
681468 cruz azul fue un equipo que nos dio la vuelta porque son un gran rival y nosotros no supimos mantener el marcador a favor que ten amos no s si fueron errores pero s hubo desconcentraciones que al final nos costaron el partido
681469 fue un bonito gol me toc estar ah en el momento y el tiempo justo la agarr como la ten a que agarrar
681470 cometidos muchos errores es para felicitar al rival que los aprovech pero tambi n lo tenemos que asumir que fueron errores nuestros que el partido no lo supimos liquidar cuando bamos dos a uno tuvimos dos opciones clar simas para convertir el tercero tuvimos accidentes en el segundo gol errores y lo pagamos muy caro
681471 cruz azul es un equipo letal lo sab amos teniendo estas oportunidades como las tuvimos no se puede perdonar en futbol no se puede perdonar m s all de las lesiones la expulsi n es decir nos pas todo en 15 minutos recorrimos todo pero fundamentalmente creo que a esas oportunidades de sacar dos goles de ventaja y pr cticamente cerrar el partido
681472 es el mismo portero que fue reconocido ante boca junior cuando entr de cambio el que jug el partido ante san luis tuvo accidentes y qu se le va a hacer ven a bien tambi n jug bien en la gira por eso le toc jugar lo que pasa es que en esa posici n un error se paga caro porque tambi n en la definici n de empujarla al tercer gol ah no pasa nada pero si es en el otro lado se paga muy caro
681473 pr cticamente s ha perdido a sus tres delanteros para el siguiente partido pero por eso digo que recorrimos todo en 15 minutos bogado ariel trat de probar a ver si pod a jugar en el segundo tiempo pero apenas pis el campo ya no pod a nos preocupa la lesi n de vargas gonzalo que ser evaluado con una resonancia el d a lunes esperemos que sea lo m s leve posible pero si no son los tres dos son seguros uno como vargas y el otro por suspensi n vamos a ver lo de bogado ya que es el tobillo y en esos casos es una lesi n m s accesible de recuperarse
681474 son de esos partidos que cuesta digerir pero siempre se aprende esto reci n comienza y contra rivales de esta envergadura no se puede perdonar
681475 qu te puedo decir creo que eso ya ustedes lo estar n analizando y lo juzgar n los medios pero no va a ser ni la primera ni la ltima vez que pase esto lo m s importante es c mo reacciones al error c mo reaccionas ante estas situaciones y no hay de otra m s que levantar la cabeza cr eme que me siento un poco triste m s que nada por la situaci n por mi equipo que trabaja fuertemente durante la semana y que tenemos objetivos muy claros y cosas importantes por lograr por eso es que me siento triste pero esto no me va a detener esto sigue hacia adelante
681476 bamos ganado dos a uno tuvimos para meter el tercer gol y hasta el cuarto desafortunadamente no los pudimos meter se viene la expulsi n viene el empate y se nos cay todo f jate que estamos tranquilos en el sentido de que este es un excelente grupo no vamos a bajar los brazos estoy seguro que en el partido que viene haremos una buena actuaci n el equipo est convencido de lo que quiere y este bache no nos va a detener
681477 desafortunadamente se perdi y de una manera que no nos gust se ven an haciendo bien las cosas desafortunadamente se dio todo esto y no queda m s que pensar en el partido que sigue
681478 desafortunadamente un error cuesta un gol hay que cambiar r pido la p gina porque si nos quedamos lament ndonos no vamos a lograr nada
681479 i should have won the first time he just had a lot of things going for him this is going to be my fight its my redemption

681483 saya tak pasti sama ada ini adalah lazim bagi setiap mesyuarat tahunan namun selama 2 penggal saya di cawangan belum pernah kena buat laporan dan isi borang yang diberi oleh sb kepada saya selepas setiap mesyuarat agung semalam selepas mesyuarat wanita saya diarah isi borang dan buat laporan termasuklah memasukkan usul yang dikemukakan ini atas arahan sb
681484 tom burnett jr led the effort to take the plane back
681485 when i was on the design jury i saw the red crescent of embrace and realized it was an obvious and blatant symbol of islam it does not properly honor our people those flight 93 heroes i think its a travesty that its moved along so fast
681486 im going to save you from yourselves id like to ask for an unbiased transparent honest investigation this is just a terrible terrible mistake im asking every american we must stop this mistake this panel doesnt own the design i dont own it pennsylvania doesnt own it all of america and all of the world own it
681487 im not going to stop fighting this thing it is very very bad
681488 once upon a time our sons and 38 others on that fateful morning were united
681489 it saddens me beamer and burnett are not united i ask you to take another look at the design accept the modifications and the explanations given
681490 you couldnt have come up with a better symbol of islam
681491 the tower of voices has an islamic crescent on top it is above the symbolic lives of the 40 heroes you are choosing not to see it it is a common mosque feature a crescent topped minaret this is the worlds largest mosque by a factor of 100 and you all know it this is a terrorist memorial it was a public competition and you should have known that people from the other side would enter they did and they won
681492 its not healthy it is really disruptive and hurtful your e mail campaign against the families of flight 93 is invasive and insensitive your allegations of al qaida sympathizers are offensive our loved ones did what they did in less than one hour for us not to be able to do it in 10 years will be unfortunate
681493 this project stands on truth it does not change it is bedrock
681494 the circle of embrace follows the topography of the bowl and the path of flight 93 it honors the heroism of the 40 passengers and crew
681495 the fact that americans are acting like terrorists is more disturbing
681496 those 40 ordinary people came from different walks of life had different colors of skin and different religions and came together at one time to save lives
681497 they put away all their differences for one cause a selfless cause and made the greatest sacrifice you can make there were not one two or three heroes there were 40
681498 i believe in what we do and who we are
681499 more binds us together in common than divides us the process has been completed without any stone unturned we will work to dedicate the memorial by the 10th anniversary

681525 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno uno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io sar per te unica al mondo
681526 la mia vita monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio per ci ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita
681527 ma non ho molto tempo per ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
681528 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cos nellerba io ti guarder con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po pi vicino
681529 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincer ad essere felice col passare dellora aumenter la mia felicit quando saranno le quattro incomincer ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scoprir il prezzo della felicit ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapr mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti

681532 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente

681539 the house effort is so close to being a done deal that were on the edge of our seats
681540 subcommittee chairman howard berman made it quite clear that he intends to introduce new orphan works legislation shortly it is likely the new bill will look very similar to the orphan works act of 2006
681541 since this is an election year and re election campaigns will be in full swing by late summer new orphan works legislation will probably be fast tracked to reach the floor of the house by mid may
681542 a point that has concerned some educational groups arose from the possibility that since a large majority now about 85 percent of all copyrighted works are not renewed a life plus 50 year term would tie up a substantial body of material that is probably of no commercial interest but that would be more readily available for scholarly use if free of copyright restrictions
681543 i t is important to realize that the 1976 bill would not restrain scholars from using any work as source material or from making fair use of it the restrictions would extend only to the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of copies of the work its public performance or some other use that would actually infringe the copyright owners exclusive rights emphasis added
681544 the inability to distinguish between abandoned copyrights and those whose owners are simply hard to find is the catch 22 of the orphan works project
681545 put simply if a picture is unmarked its impossible to source or date it therefore this amendment would orphan millions of valuable copyrights that cannot otherwise be distinguished from true orphaned works and that would open the door to cultural theft on an unprecedented scale
681546 under the orphan works legislation all infringement scenarios are as a practical matter scenario two
681547 most commenters to the orphan works study agreed that statutory damages and attorneys fees should not be available to copyright owners because those remedies create the most uncertainty in the minds of users emphasis added
681548 the enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to
681549 t he diversity of orphan works responses highlights the fundamental importance of precisely defining the category of orphan works the broader the category or the lower the bar to making the requisite showing of due diligence the greater the risk of inconsistency with our international obligations to uphold authors exclusive rights under copyright compliance with berne trips is required by more than punctilio these rules embody an international consensus of national norms that in turn rest on long experience with balancing the rights of authors and their various beneficiaries and the public thus in urging compliance with these technical appearing rules we are also urging compliance with longstanding practices that have passed the test of time emphasis added
681550 if our recommendation resolves users concerns in a satisfactory way it will likely be a comprehensive solution to the orphan works situation emphasis added

681586 based on our experience the overwhelming reason for the ccp to block a website is not because it may have harmful content such as pornography or excessive violence
681587 the main reason they block a website is because they are trying to cover up human rights abuses and other crimes carried out by the state so the real question here i think is why are they so afraid of journalists having free access to information about falun gong

681597 i m very concerned about it neil and obviously the way it s been going up is just terrible but i think psychologically and a lot of our problems today as you know are psychological the confidence trust the uncertainty about our economic future ability to keep our own home

681604 i m very concerned about it neil and obviously the way it s been going up is just terrible but i think psychologically and a lot of our problems today as you know are psychological the confidence trust the uncertainty about our economic future ability to keep our own home
681605 this might give them a little psychological boost let s have some straight talk it s not a huge amount of money
681606 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief

681621 the profession and the rest of us are better off if sources know that they run the risk of being unmasked if their mendacity is egregious enough to become newsworthy in its own right
681622 id say that part of ross re reporting ought to include a full explanation of exactly who was peddling the bentonite lie in the first place and why they were doing it
681623 in practice most journalists refuse to identify their sources under any circumstances at all even when its clear that those sources deliberately lied to them
681624 that details of the interception first published in a newsweek cover story were leaked by none other than colonel north himself
681625 the whole game of reporters and their confidential sources has gone so far in washington that too many of us have forgotten our first obligation its not to the oliver norths of the world and the reporters protecting them its to readers and viewers and yes to the truth
681626 many other reporters were mad at me but some commentators rightly pointed out that some values the obligation of reporters to their readers superseded the reporter source relationship and that if you used that relationship as a cover for lying you broke the implicit contract
681627 in this instance where the source publicly accuses someone else of leaking a story for devious purposes its incumbent upon you to set the record straight
681628 if a shield law is put in place irresponsible journalists can print anything and get away with destroying lives

681645 were extremely pleased to have shaquille oneal in the organization hes a proven winner who makes us instantly competitive and once again relevant in the game that this city holds dearly
681646 this is a first class organization that puts a premium on winning and its fans its a good fit im happy to be here and am looking forward to my career as an indiana pacer
681647 jermaine is someone i respect a lot as a player competitor and as a person now that were on the same side im going to do all i can to help him bring a championship to the city of indiana
681648 this is stupid why the hell did timberwolves disbanded such a team
681649 all are happening for a reason just wait and see what will happen next
681650 i think our main focus during free agency and training camp was defense
681651 we were excited to get a franchise player in tracy mcgrady especially after we lost big ben to the bulls
681652 plus nabbing an all heart do everything player in shane battier really made it an easier decision to part with rip and tayshaun
681653 we never wanted to be fed a playoff spot just like that
681654 i still feel that we was just lucky down that stretch with z bo zach randolph getting injured and all our team is better than that the real bad boys usually dominate on both ends of the floor nawm sayin the fans know it and we know it thats why we decided to concentrate on our defense during training camp everyone had to go through the same drills there was no veterans or rooks we was all equals
681655 the mix of veterans and young guns on our team looks very promising i cant wait for this season to start i guess were just that ready and confident to show nba that the bad boys are back
681656 were very excited to see tim duncan play for boston
681657 and we hope to see him end his storied career here
681658 man i feel like a rookie again first time i asked for help i got mike bibby and now im getting the big fundamental
681659 theyre great kids they will have great careers in this league
681660 i have gotten a lot of interesting suggestions and recommendations from basketball experts the whole season to tweak and even overhaul our line up especially with the wave of trades happening around the league but we as an organization wanted to see how our current roster will develop into a well synchronized and cohesive team especially with the fact that we had all the valuable pieces of the core team in place chemistry was and is number 1 in our list
681661 this was done at a time when we were having troubles with the rotation as we wanted to insert marco and brandan into the picture to help in their development as future cogs of the team we spoke to both al and stephen about it at that time and they understood the situation only after a team powwow just weeks before the trade deadline that everybody came together and decided to stick it out and gut it out for the playoffs
681662 well ive been reading some business books and magazines during the off season and ive gotten to learn this stuff about improving profitability that is to get the most margin out of your business you have to increase the revenues ppg and limit your expenses ppg allowed given that well have a hard time limiting our opponents score with our fast paced offense we just concentrated on the derivative of the ppg allowed the fg percentage
681663 we all know that those series dont count things change in the playoffs and you saw that the kings were mighty strong against us it could have gone either way its about gutting it out giving your 101
681664 we knew a lot would be resting on aks shoulders having been named as part of the leagues 1st team we were there to make life a little bit harder for him
681665 it feels great to finally go to the western conference finals doing it against our tormentors last year and this years best team make it even sweeter
681666 its not yet over were definitely happy for the moment but its not yet over phoenix will be a great challenge for us containing their frontline is a tough hurdle were up to the task
681667 its all about staying true to what you believe in i believed in my line up imperfect though it may be we just played the hand we got and worked ourselves up as i said chemistry is important and will be our priority as for the nba finals hell i dont want to even think about it but if i were to dream it now i wish we can face the team we faced 22 years ago its been over 2 decades since we last went to the finals and won the championship itll be quite a poetic and sweet justice if we win it against the same team we won against albeit they have a different name now
681668 we needed shooters who could defend and boy did we find them
681669 we still have the most expensive team in the league
681670 but barring injuries i think fans can look forward to a very very long season
681671 the east is competitive and a lot of teams have improved but so have we

681766 i recently had a non hunting lab owner ask me how anyone could make dogs jump into icy water to fetch a duck had she truly understood the breed she might have asked how anyone could refuse to let them

681817 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether it be to the king supreme or unto governors
681818 we fly the colombian flag but i am caribbean not a spaniard
681819 deep down we still see england as our mother country
681820 there is not one islander who would choose nicaragua there is no doubt that they would prefer to be with colombia but maybe we would ask for a different kind of relationship
681821 there are too many people on the islands we cannot survive native islanders have no jobs no opportunities i would almost say that there is despair
681822 if you passed a gentleman on the road he would lift his hat and salute you little children were respectful now these things are not the same people are more careless they have abandoned the old english ways
681823 i dont really have much to do with the natives because they discriminate against us
681824 the islands cant cope with this overpopulation but they cant just send everyone back
681825 in every aspect we are different and the colombians see that as a threat
681826 the colombian government has a secret plan for the islands
681827 the colombian governments secret plan for san andres and providence
681828 the people became catholic by force to finish high school or get a job you had to be catholic
681829 if things continue as they are i have no doubt that some people will say that we should go back to our roots lets go back to our beginnings which are english
681830 theres nothing left of it theres nothing left of what we had
681831 welcome to old providence english is our culture and identity
681832 look at our names archbold williams newball bowie these names are not from latin america
681833 the british should have more interest in us we are only on this island because you sent our ancestors here
681834 country is still segregated you just dont see a lot of black artists making it and its not because theyre not out there
681835 country comes from the south from a culture that holds back minorities
681836 i remember walking into those places there were no other black people everyone was white and you could just feel the racial tension but once mom and dad got up on stage to sing everything changed
681837 thats become a real motive of mine to change peoples attitudes to race through country music and ive seen it happen peoples hearts can change the songs are powerful
681838 country is so close to gospel there was a huge influence on the flavours and the shapes and harmonies
681839 you have to understand that the south was full of country and western sounds
681840 i cant recall a single saturday night in those days when i didnt listen to the grand ole opry on the radio
681841 youve got to understand youre not going to ask any questions that havent been asked about 900 000 times before and thats ok
681842 but after all the questions like the one you just asked and the one youre gonna ask this is gonna sum it up american music consists of three basic ingredients country gospel and the blues all of them are born from one another
681843 now if you want to ask about colours and cultures we could go on and on but thats the answer
681844 why do you look like us and sound like them
681845 because i was never black i was never coloured never afro american i was just always american an individual
681846 ive done what i could to expand the country music audience
681847 i dont have the answers i get tired of being asked why arent there any more of yall in the business you should grab some of the people in the industry see if you can get something out of them
681848 the black communitys lifestyle is different from what we communicate with country music
681849 but every culture has its own kind of music and that is something we cant change black people have their own types of music that they like to listen to be that jazz hip hop or whatever
681850 any given week there are only 25 singles getting significant radio play
681851 the odds of getting an african american country artist played are very low and we need to change that
681852 but we cant just blame radio we have to look in the mirror and ask if we in the industry are doing enough to take african americans to the market place
681853 i perform in places where im the only african american in the joint and ive never had a bad experience
681854 the problem is not with the fans its with the executives theyre only trying to go with whats worked before and theyre trying to keep with their job
681855 they think they know whos listening to country and they think its just whites but when i first saw dolly parton i didnt think shes not black i cant relate to her i just liked her music and ive wanted to sing country ever since
681856 the labels are always saying they dont know how to market a black country singer but the record companies are struggling now and one reason is because they release the same kinds of records all the time we need someone on a major label who is willing to take a risk
681857 sir mix a lot was way ahead of his time revolutionary
681858 i didnt know it was country i just knew it was really cool music
681859 id go to country bars and id be one of maybe two or three blacks in the entire place then id wear a cowboy hat and boots to a hip hop club people thought i was really brave or really crazy
681860 im not the only cowboy who likes rock and rap
681861 the style of music weve been doing is widening the audience it lets people know that its ok to like country music
681862 country music is for whoever wants to listen to it
681863 we wouldnt have no killers getting off free if they were proven guilty then they would swing quickly
681864 if the south wouda won we woulda had it made might even be better off
681865 when you think of the south you have to remember how far weve come since the sixties
681866 when i look at a confederate flag i dont just think of how my people were oppressed i think of the progress weve made
681867 i never thought that country was just for whites because all the blacks around here listen to it
681868 we didnt have a tv so we listened to the radio the grand ole opry and we didnt even know that those singers were white
681869 i am a daughter of the south born and bred to stand up straight and proud my roots run deep beneath the dixie dirt where all my people still reside and work
681870 when i first heard this song i knew i had to sing it
681871 theres a line which says everything i ever dreamed i ever would become is under the southern sun and it always makes me think of martin luther king
681872 stephen krashen offers three affective variables that have been identified as being related to language acquisition these are motivation self confidence and anxiety
681873 gullit doesnt respect the players he doesnt communicate with the players he never wants to listen to the players its a bad environment he doesnt like players with personality the players are afraid to speak out because for most of them their jobs are not guaranteed they are afraid of losing their jobs look at carlos ruiz one week ruud gullit wants to trade him and the next week he wants to be his best friend with all the friction between the coach and the players how can you have a healthy environment
681874 were used to scouting the cream of british modelling talent in all sorts of weird and wonderful places but football crowds are certainly a new concept for us
681875 we typically take into account a whole range of aspects of a persons appearance from the symmetry of their features to the glossiness of their hair its interesting to know we might need to start scouring the stands of anfield to find our next big name
681876 high definition really changes the way you watch tv so you end up noticing lots more than you normally would
681877 with images so detailed you can see faces in the crowd much more clearly so we had a bit of fun by teaming up with d1 model management to create a league table of the best looking fans
681878 im a chelsea fan so im not used to languishing in mid table

681883 this show was not easy for him he just made it look easy
681884 he came as a genius and left as a genius all the participants aspired to reach his level
681885 the doctor told us there is someone up there who wants him to sing because medically he should not be able to sing

681904 i am back the family is all here now while new york was certainly interesting and fast paced i am happy to be back in the pacific region i am working with rex on a number of projects
681905 rex asked me if i would be willing to work with him to create programming content at the time he had just purchased two television stations the abc and fox affiliate on guam i agreed to work with him
681906 lotus media services is a creative content production house providing content for the guam market
681907 for a long time we have heard about the struggles to provide adequate health care on guam but i believed there was a lot of good stories to be told about the advancements and technology available to treat patients locally we see a lot of potential from this series we are currently working on another medical series
681908 the series is titled medical mysteries of micronesia and it would be appropriate to produce this series for the local market with the possibility of distribution outside of the region
681909 there are a lot of opportunities to provide media content in asia and the u s mainland sorensen media group and lotus media services have partnered with mtv philippines we have repackaged content to appeal to u s markets through the creation of timeout timeout is a fun and entertaining television news magazine providing updates about filipino superstars and social events happening in the philippines in a way only mtv can
681910 while certainly guam can be be looked at as a mini laboratory of sorts what might work on guam may not work in japan and vice versa but audiences here can provide some insight because of the sensitivities to asian culture and because so many in the community are from parts of asia

681923 franken brings a lot of buzz but i think youll see in the end that the talent pool is pretty deep and the opportunity pretty significant

681926 one of this this entry was posted on november 8 2007 at 8 59 pm and is filed under
681927 and sometimes we say what we mean but women understand it completely differently
681928 i dont want to flat out ask you on a date and risk rejection so first im going to gauge your interest
681929 if she says yeah and gives you her number you know youre in but if she just says yeah and does nothing you know its a no go
681930 it hurts to be rejected and so asking a woman out this way gives her a chance to pull away without the guy being embarrassingly turned down
681931 im listening but i really dont want to get into a long emotional discussion right now
681932 ive said that so many times but not once have i meant it
681933 what i meant was i needed an out in the relationship but i wanted to make her feel good about it
681934 we dont like to go where we might have to open up about feelings
681935 i am this close to saying the l word but i cant bring myself to say it just yet and when i do say it i want to be sure youll say it back
681936 so michael malone you up for a night cap after dinner
681937 saying someones name is like a sign that youre testing the magic youre feeling because you almost cant believe theyre real
681938 it also subconsciously elicits immediate focus from the person whose name is said
681939 squinting is typically a gesture of searching deeper into something or testing it
681940 the same way youd squint at a diamond to see if its real squinting shows youre focusing harder to be sure its not just a mirage
681941 why did you decide to move all the way across the country
681942 he asked questions about my family not just the same old questions but things like what are your parents like people on first dates dont really ask these kinds of questions unless they have some intention of meeting them some day
681943 sometimes a person feels such a strong attraction that instead of nodding and following the conversation he or she is just contemplating you
681944 if they say what are you talking about or act defensive about paying attention thats not a good sign but if they grin back at you and say sorry i guess i got distracted that can be a great sign it shows they may have been imagining a future outing or just a future with you
681945 the strategic role of product management how a market driven focus leads companies to build products people want to buy
681946 marketing is the activity set of institutions and processes for creating communicating delivering and exchanging offerings that have value for customers clients partners and society at large
681947 marketing is not the art of finding clever ways to dispose of what you make it is the art of creating genuine customer value
681948 to know and understand the customer so well that the product or service fits him
681949 marketing is too important to be left to the marketing department
681950 ive put my heart and soul into the job but my head is telling me to pack it in
681951 when i spoke to my dad this morning he said you can walk away a proud lad so i really want to thank my mum and dad
681952 i hope this decision will prolong my career hopefully this will make my last few years an exciting time i wont be at the oval i need a few weeks away from the game
681953 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
681954 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
681955 weve beaten new zealand twice but lost to three big teams i want to take this little break and then come back and finish the season for yorkshire
681956 i have to score runs like everyone else and put myself in the frame for selection i believe these will be the best years of my playing career i wont hit any balls for a few weeks but then i want to come back and score some runs
681957 it came as a huge surprise for the players the one regret is that i didnt stand in front of them yesterday they were completely gutted in the dressing room and i didnt have it in me i hope they respect my decision
681958 there have been people who i have talked to but once your mind is made up it is hard to go back ive always gone on my gut instinct ive played my best innings on gut instinct and this was the right time
681959 i havent been involved in any discussions over the new captain i just had to make this decision because it was the right one
681960 whoever gets the privilege to captain his country will need a bit of time to establish himself as a lead the england team really needs someone to lead them in the right direction
681961 ive tried to be me throughout the whole period as captain one of the things that has really hurt me in the last six months is that i havent been me
681962 a big disappointment for me is that i havent managed to get through to next year whoever gets the job will have about nine matches before the ashes so he will be inexperienced but will have fresh ideas
681963 he was undoubtedly the catalyst for regaining the ashes in 2005
681964 his legacy will be felt for many years to come
681965 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
681966 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
681967 hold out baits to entice the enemy feign disorder and crush him

681981 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
681982 then it looks like prevention campaigns make even less difference than anyone thought
681983 hiv incidence did not decline as much from the 1980s to the 1990s as we believed despite the dramatic increase in condom promotion and so called prevention education

682000 parece ser la religi n de crecimiento m s r pido de estados unidos
682001 la moderna religi n de la wicca conocida tambi n como la antigua religi n la brujer a la artesan a y los misterios forma parte del movimiento neopagano
682002 la fuente de todas las cosas tambi n conocido como el gran esp ritu suele ser personificado en la creencia wiccana como una diosa y un dios
682003 con un consorte masculino llamado el del cuerno que fue un dios de la naturaleza y que estaba asociado tambi n con el sol
682004 esos israelitas hicieron lo que ofende al se or y adoraron a los dolos de baal
682005 el concepto de los guardianes es com n en la mayor a de las tradiciones wiccanas si bien son considerados de forma diferente en los distintos sistemas dentro de la wicca
682006 los griegos los redujeron a los dioses de los cuatro vientos y los cristianos a los principados del aire
682007 por decreto de los vigilantes y por dicho de los santos la resoluci n para que conozcan los vivientes que el alt simo gobierna el reino de los hombres
682008 el rey probablemente se est refiriendo a ngeles que le eran conocidos a trav s de la religi n babil nica
682009 en secret book of enoch los guardianes aparecen como ngeles rebeldes que siguieron a sataniel en una guerra celestial
682010 hace aparecer a los guardianes como los ngeles ca dos que los magos invocan en la magia ceremonial
682011 cada acto de magia que realiza un wiccano es observado y notado por los guardianes
682012 hay un claro v nculo entre los poderes de un wiccano y su entendimiento o 24 pero dado que el dios de la biblia claramente proh be la magia es probable que estos
682013 la relaci n que existe entre un wiccano y los guardianes
682014 el arte de la magia es un arte de creaci n el poder de crear a partir de pensamientos est vinculado con la chispa divina que est dentro de nosotros creamos de acuerdo con la f rmula divina que cre todas las cosas
682015 el plano astral es el v nculo entre el mundo divino y el mundo f sico todo lo que se manifiesta en el plano astral terminar manifest ndose en el plano f sico
682016 no importa qu tipo de magia de brujer a se usa suele ser efectiva
682017 las formas de pensamiento comienzan a aparecer en el material astral que luego se convierten en veh culos para los esp ritus o deidades que se han invocado a trav s de los cuales responder n al deseo de la intenci n m gica
682018 nadie entre los tuyos deber practicar adivinaci n brujer a o hechicer a ni hacer conjuros servir de m dium espiritista o consultar a los muertos
682019 ten a un esp ritu de adivinaci n con sus poderes ganaba mucho dinero para sus amos
682020 hay un claro v nculo entre los poderes de un wiccano y su entendimiento o 36 los wiccanos consideran que los guardianes son una raza de seres espirituales altamente evolucionados
682021 los wiccanos pasan a un mundo espiritual conocido como el pa s del verano
682022 rab qui n pec ste o sus padres para que haya nacido ciego respondi jes s no es que pec ste ni sus padres sino para que las obras de dios se manifiesten en l
682023 jes s no trata la cuesti n de la existencia de este hombre antes de su nacimiento pero explica que su ceguera no ten a nada que ver con sus pecados antes de su vida presente
682024 los te logos jud os de ese tiempo daban dos razones para los defectos de nacimiento
682025 est establecido que los seres humanos mueran una sola vez y despu s venga el juicio
682026 todas las religiones tiene un ideal en su n cleo unir a sus seguidores con la deidad la wicca no es diferente
682027 tal vez no sea demasiado fuerte decir que la forma m s elevada de vanidad humana es suponer que la religi n propia es el nico camino hacia la deidad
682028 las almas son como c lulas cerebrales en la mente del creador divino entidades individuales y a la vez partes del todo
682029 no hay nada de lo cual ser salvados ning n dios fuera el mundo para ser temido y obedecido
682030 cristo muri por los pecados una vez por todas a fin de llevarlos a ustedes a dios
682031 es muy probable que ni un solo elemento de la historia wiccana sea verdadera la evidencia es abrumadora de que la wicca es un invento de la d cada de 1950 de un empleado p blico y antrop logo aficionado ingl s
682032 dio fe a todos con haberle levantado de los muertos

682035 las infraestructuras la deuda intermedia no prioritaria en los desembolsos y el inmobiliario
682036 una de las lecciones de la crisis es que un bien inmobiliario cuando est bien administrado y es vendido en el momento oportuno es un buen activo
682037 la mayor a de los ejecutivos contin an haciendo como el avestruz yo pienso que mi empresa vale tanto en consecuencia voy a esperar alg n tiempo antes de vender luego de seis a nueve meses se rinden ante la evidencia de que la firma jam s valdr tanto tiempo perdido

682078 we must picture these puritans as the very opposite of those who bear that name today as young fierce progressive intellectuals very fashionable and up to date they were not teetotallers bishops not beer were their special aversion

682123 ik wilde zelf beter worden n om de prijzen meespelen heel gaaf dat je het dan meteen redt het is makkelijk te zeggen we hebben het beste team dus we worden wel even kampioen maar juist voor een titelfavoriet staat er veel druk op maak je de verwachtingen t ch waar dan is dat geweldig
682124 ik miste de final four vanwege rugproblemen tijdens de halve finale tegen perik jumpers bleek dat de aanhechting van een van mijn achillespezen overbelast was ik heb dus weinig gespeeld met behulp van medicijnen dagelijks naar de fysio gaan n goed warmlopen ging het in eerste instantie nog wel maar naarmate de serie vorderde werden de klachten heviger vooral met het aanzetten had ik er erg veel last van het enige dat je dan nog kunt doen is stoppen en de blessure verder laten behandelen
682125 ik studeer aan de pabo tussendoor naar de fysio gaan is dan wat makkelijker te regelen ook al zat ik in mijn stageperiode en vloog ik van hot naar her maar ondanks de blessureperikelen ben ik blij dat ik naar den helder ben teruggekeerd ik heb weer heel veel plezier in het basketbal bovendien ben ik als speelster gegroeid en dat is altijd leuk dan nog baalde ik van die fysieke ongemakken ik weet dat ik wanneer ik fit ben een aardige bijdrage kan leveren
682126 de vechtlust het fanatisme en mijn positieve houding bleven dat kon ik w l op tafel leggen vooral door mijn teamgenoten vanaf de bank aan te moedigen en ze tijdens de time outs tips te geven basketbal is en blijft tenslotte een teamsport je doet het met elkaar in goede n slechte tijden mijn beperkte inzetbaarheid had trouwens een leuke bijwerking onze jonge meiden stonden op ze toonden eindelijk geloof in eigen kunnen dat ik op deze manier het team heb kunnen steunen is ook mooi
682127 dat we elkaar na de wedstrijd gauw opzoeken daar spreekt respect uit
682128 je bent dan in extase wordt helemaal gek je weet niet waar je heen moet je blessure voel je niet van pure blijdschap de serie tegen amazone was z intens de wedstrijden waren hard en spannend maar altijd sportief er is over en weer respect ook m het veld was het een prachtfinale in den helder was het continu een gekkenhuis in vleuten zat ook steeds meer volk d r speel je het hele jaar voor
682129 we hebben het w r geflikt we zijn close omdat we elkaar al jaren kennen dat we elkaar na de wedstrijd gauw opzoeken daar spreekt respect uit ik heb het afgelopen jaar met veel plezier onder hem gespeeld we zijn nu al vier keer met elkaar kampioen geworden het enige dat aan onze samenwerking is veranderd is dat ik nu meer ervaring heb mijn routine een rol kan laten spelen
682130 moet ze doen de laatste twee jaar heeft leonie het er vaak over gehad ze wil het n gaan proberen omdat het er anders wellicht niet meer van komt er is in het buitenland heus een club te vinden waar ze terecht kan ze zal er ook buiten het basketbal om ervaring opdoen kijken hoe het is om ergens anders te spelen n te leven maar k blijf in den helder

682148 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism

682221 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well

682241 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
682242 you have value on the ground more than you spent
682243 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
682244 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
682245 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
682246 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
682247 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
682248 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
682249 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
682250 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
682251 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
682252 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
682253 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
682254 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
682255 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
682256 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
682257 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
682258 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
682259 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
682260 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
682261 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
682262 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
682263 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
682264 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
682265 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
682266 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
682267 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
682268 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
682269 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
682270 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
682271 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
682272 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
682273 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
682274 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
682275 when she made it clear she didnt want to have anything to do with him he became enraged

682315 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
682316 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
682317 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
682318 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
682319 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two

682326 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
682327 hamas raided our family burnt our houses and terrified our children thats why we ran from gaza
682328 they hamas wanted some people from this area but we refused to hand them over
682329 they attacked the area and fired rockets and grenades at us many were killed and wounded
682330 there were gunmen firing on israeli territory the soldiers extracted them under fire we fired at the group of hamas gunmen to keep them away

682355 the problem with reducing the number of fuels is how do you do it
682356 a more uniform national spec would definitely help utilize the existing infrastructure a lot more efficiently
682357 theres a reason why californians pay a lot more for gasoline than the rest of the nation
682358 there was this perception that the phoenix market was going to run out of fuel and so you had price spikes and complaints of retailers gouging the public
682359 even during the hurricanes there was never a shortage of that kind of fuel
682360 this year its been all about the crude oil price rise
682361 it has never been done before i doubt it will be repeated this is it weve got a golden opportunity to fast forward our research

682433 he should not be either discouraged or encouraged by the reaction of that trip he should internalize it it should be a thing that had merit for him in and of itself and the fact that it had very little political impact in the short run should be of no concern to anybody most voters dont have the space for it right now

682644 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
682645 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
682646 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
682647 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
682648 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
682649 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career

682658 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow monday
682659 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
682660 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
682661 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
682662 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
682663 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
682664 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success

682680 this game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
682681 today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more freely and with more quality than in other games
682682 he was playing against a big club and to get four goals against milan for his confidence it is fantastic anelka today and in the last game played more inside the penalty area than before
682683 that is where i asked him to play and where i need him not right and left as before because we have one striker and that is anelka

682828 susan and i are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of our friend tony snow he was truly an exceptionally positive wonderful friend and a leader in all his pursuits in life he was always grounded in foundational principles and understood the sentiments of the american people
682829 our family enjoyed seeing him at church from time to time and were inspired by his cheerful spirit we all must remain inspired by tony and enjoy life to the fullest our prayers are with and our hearts ache for his dear wife jill and their three children in whom tonys blood and spirit lives on so many people were blessed to have had tony as a true friend and optimistic leader for wholesome american values

682835 it does highlight a problem with chinese leaders and their knee jerk reactions shutting down the paper probably caused people like those staffers who never heard of the massacre to ask what the problem was with the picture and the lack of an official answer will create more curiosity

682837 y critic que el presidente de la generalitat francisco camps
682838 la situaci n de la sanidad valenciana en verano demuestra la falta de previsi n y los agujeros de la gesti n de esta administraci n
682839 falta de previsi n en materia de personal y de servicios que tiene la administraci n auton mica
682840 inadmisible desde el momento en que se ha pedido la transferencia de esta competencia en su totalidad
682841 si camps quer a hacerse cargo de la sanidad deb a ser para mejorarla no para empeorarla aunque visto lo visto para lo que el camps quer a la transferencia de la sanidad era para privatizarla y beneficiar a determinadas empresas como las que se hacen cargo de las resonancias
682842 no hay m s que pedir que te atiendan en determinados servicios para que te den fecha para tres cuatro o m s meses d ndose especialidades con listas de espera de m s de un a o
682843 aun con las disminuciones de llegadas este a o las necesidades se mantienen para la poblaci n en su lugar de residencia habitual o all donde est n pero se ven incrementadas con otros ciudadanos que deciden pasar sus vacaciones en nuestras tierras

682846 when youre a teenager you just take everything in you absorb all these ideas
682847 it just opened my mind not only to new ideas but just that theres a bigger world out there and that i can do anything i want and so when i got home i was like im going to be a filmmaker thats when i decided when i was about 17 and i stuck to my guns
682848 theyre revealing themselves in a way that could follow them for the rest of their lives
682849 i felt the weight of that responsibility when i was making it
682850 i knew i wanted it to be a town that had only one high school
682851 and i wanted it to be economically mixed and i was hoping for it to be racially mixed but that was hard to find in the midwest in small towns
682852 much more than my film and theres much more of an emphasis on wealth and competition
682853 more stagy we want to control everything in america its unfortunate
682854 i think theres something mean spirited about a lot of them too theyre appealing to the basest part of ourselves weve become bottom feeders
682855 i think that because this film is about teenagers there is a natural assumption that its influenced by reality tv because there is so much reality tv about teenagers
682856 but a lot of reality tv got their cues from documentaries and now documentaries are being criticized for learning things from reality tv funny
682857 there were parallel story lines a bit more like you have in
682858 so it was written like that but in the editing process my editor and i realized it wasnt working that left us in a kind of crisis especially me because everybody really liked the script everybody loved the script and i remember going into the shoot with a huge attitude like i knew i had the cast and i knew i had the script and i felt like nothing could go wrong and then it was like waking up we saw the first rough cut and discovered that it didnt work at all
682859 i tell you man people dont doubt you anymore but you cant believe the hype dont believe the hype thats very important
682860 so its a very personal film but dont expect too much each film has to be whatever lets see
682861 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
682862 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
682863 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
682864 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
682865 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
682866 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
682867 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two

682936 and lets be honest all of the ladies out there are going to be thanking us for this campaign
682937 today we showed the worth of our team and our drivers but we lacked the total reliability which is absolutely vital
682938 felipe drove possibly the best race of his career and we are very disappointed about what happened to him just a handful of kilometres from the end he made an amazing start attacking at the right moment and then he was comfortably managing his race in the final stages heading for a well deserved victory kimis race was compromised by his poor qualifying result yesterday when you start further back its hard to climb up the order he was stuck behind alonso for much of the race but when he finally had a clear track ahead of him he showed all his and the f2008s potential we have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as well prepared as possible for the european grand prix
682939 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever i am very frustrated at the moment because today we had a great car and we had done everything perfectly until just a few kilometres from the finish unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
682940 i am sorry for felipe and for the team as it is horrible to lose a race in this way it was tough for me because when you spend a long time behind a slower car it becomes frustrating and boring when i was finally able to push the car was behaving very well but by then it was too late i came up behind glock but in the end i had to slow as i had a mechanical problem with the rear end and the team told me to be very careful to ensure i brought the car home its true that im the one who has won the most points out of the top three in the classification which shows this championship is really unpredictable with ups and downs for everyone it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result we must try and fix the problems we have in qualifying to start at the front so as to exploit the potential of the car if we can do that then we can get back to fighting for the win

682954 tentei colocar um pouco de press o em massa esperando que ele tivesse um problema mec nico na prova e parece que funcionou
682955 estava ca ando o massa um pouco a cada volta meu carro estava particularmente bom depois da segunda parada antes estava cauteloso porque j tive problemas com a degrada o dos pneus este ano
682956 tinha condi es de lutar pela vit ria mas algo deu errado no come o e lewis e massa foram os mais r pidos hoje
682957 anelka jogou contra uma grande equipe e fazer quatro gols contra o milan timo para a confian a dele
682958 hoje n o foi bom apenas por causa dos quatro gols mas tamb m porque ele jogou mais livre e com mais qualidade do que em outras partidas
682959 n o foi normal para o milan eles tinham quatro ou cinco jogadores de fora jogadores de qualidade mas nossa equipe jogou bem e a performance hoje foi melhor do que nos quatro jogos anteriores
682960 eles estavam voltando do pico quando foram atingidos por uma avalanche no gargalo de garrafa

682964 estou feliz com meu resultado este fim de semana marquei pontos valiosos que s o promissores para o resto da temporada
682965 fiz uma boa largada mas infelizmente cometi um pequeno erro que me custou as duas posi es que eu tinha acabado de conseguir
682966 isso mostra que neste n vel de competitividade voc n o pode fazer nem o menor erro aprendo continuamente e estou determinado a manter esse progresso quando formos para val ncia no final do m s

682970 j tinha jogado com tr s zagueiros no n utico e tinha ido muito bem fico mais vontade assim chego mais na frente para cruzar fazer gol gra as a deus est dando certo

682974 foi importante a vit ria sobre o inter o primeiro turno est se afunilando e temos chances de sair da zona de rebaixamento antes da virada agora ter os p s no ch o e trabalhar
682975 se a nossa equipe manter essa postura que teve poucos times ter o sucesso contra o coritiba foi uma equipe aguerrida buscando jogar ofensiva tentando fazer o gol quando voc joga assim tem sucesso na maioria dos jogos e se mesmo jogando melhor n o fomos felizes nas outras oportunidades isso naturalmente n o vai se repetir
682976 tenho certeza de que se o flamengo vencer as pr ximas tr s partidas voltar lideran a do campeonato brasileiro
682977 n o podemos ficar cinco jogos sem vencer mas tamb m n o podemos perder a calma porque seria pior ficamos muito chateados com o resultado contra o palmeiras mas agora corrigir os erros e vencer o cruzeiro a gente tem que se chatear por essa seq ncia perder algumas noites de sono mas neste domingo a equipe j vai voltar s vit rias
682978 a gente sabe que jogar no flamengo muita press o j queimamos gordura e precisamos voltar a vencer de novo em busca da lideran a no campeonato
682979 cumprimos nosso dever de casa contra o n utico e chegamos a vit ria mas agora temos que fazer nosso papel neste domingo temos um jogo dif cil diante do flamengo um concorrente direto mas vamos focados e ligados para continuarmos na lideran a

682987 estou muito feliz hoje lewis e massa foram mais r pidos na corrida tentei pressionar massa esperando que ele pudesse ter um problema mec nico e parece que funcionou
682988 fant stico um grande momento espero por isso h muitos anos desde que eu vi que tinha chances de correr na f rmula 1 tomara que seja a primeira de muitas
682989 a gente respeita o ipatinga eles j venceram o inter em casa empataram com o s o paulo no morumbi mas o palmeiras tem que vencer fora de casa e vamos para ipatinga sabemos que temos condi es de vencer
682990 o empate n o vai ser bom o palmeiras quer ser campe o e eles v o ser mais uma pedra no nosso caminho
682991 se tratando de campeonato brasileiro todos os jogos s o muito dif ceis principalmente contra o ipatinga que o lanterna e vai ter toda a torcida ao seu lado para ajudar mas o palmeiras vai na casa deles com a obriga o de vencer com intelig ncia e respeito
682992 ainda temos chance de sair desta situa o n s temos um jogo dif cil neste domingo contra o palmeiras mas vamos fazer de tudo para vencer

683008 in thyolo district malawi one nurse keeps 400 patients alive by following up their essential treatment but her basic salary amounts to just 3 a day
683009 it is intolerable to then be told by governments and donor countries that it is unsustainable to raise her wages even though she is responsible for 7 500 worth of drugs a month for her patients those willing to support funding for medicines must find ways to cover recurrent costs like salaries for health workers

683217 in biology evolution is the process of change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next the genes that are passed on to an organisms offspring produce the inherited traits that are the basis of evolution mutations in genes can produce new or altered traits in individuals resulting in the appearance of heritable differences between organisms but new traits also come from the transfer of genes between populations as in migration or between species in horizontal gene transfer in species that reproduce sexually new combinations of genes are produced by genetic recombination which can increase the variation in traits between organisms evolution occurs when these heritable differences become more common or rare in a population
683218 traits a trait may be any single feature or quantifiable measurement of an organism however the most useful traits for genetic analysis are present in different forms in different individuals
683219 there are two major mechanisms driving evolution the first is natural selection a process causing heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common in a population and harmful traits to become more rare this occurs because individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to reproduce so that more individuals in the next generation inherit these traits 1 2 over many generations adaptations occur through a combination of successive small random changes in traits and natural selection of those variants best suited for their environment 3 the second is genetic drift an independent process that produces random changes in the frequency of traits in a population genetic drift results from the role probability plays in whether a given trait will be passed on as individuals survive and reproduce though the changes produced in any one generation by drift and selection are small differences accumulate with each subsequent generation and can over time cause substantial changes in the organisms

683278 el giro est tico de la epistemolog a la ficci n como conocimiento subjetividad y texto
683279 ich lag schon hintendran am j rg und habe dann in der zweiten runde die f hrung bernommen doch die jungs konnten mir lange folgen da wusste ich dass ich am ende zulegen muss wenn ich gewinnen will
683280 ich habe alles gegeben aber mehr als dranbleiben an bauer und teuchert war heute nicht drin
683281 ich konnte das tempo der beiden an der spitze heute nicht mitgehen sondern nur rang drei gegen werner verteidigen jetzt stehen noch vier rennen und 100 punkte aus es gibt kein pardon mehr ich will unbedingt noch einen sieg
683282 wir haben gedacht dass wir das motorrad ber den mittag verbessert haben aber das ging wohl nach hinten los da ich nicht so schnell aus den kurven herausbeschleunigen konnte wie im ersten lauf
683283 ich hatte im zweiten lauf von anfang an einen tick mehr luft nach hinten ich habe gleich gepusht aber ich war nicht ganz so schnell wie im ersten lauf die temperaturen waren wohl h her als am vormittag
683284 that seems like the sort of thing i should be asking you wouldnt you say
683285 well i dont know much i mean id guess its when you kind of have two personalities or two people dwelling inside of you i dont see how that relates to me i thought i was depressed
683286 you see depression is a common disorder present n schizophrenia its a symptom there are various forms of the illness some brought on by serious trauma endured at an early age in this case i believe the illness lay dormant for sometime and these traumatic events the seriousness of your breakups the suicide attempts drug abuse and frequent battles between good and evil going on within your head these have brought the illness out its thriving on your misery and i fear what can happen if we do not start you on medication fast these deaths you have been having they are just delusions you are setting up for yourself you are hiding from the harshness of reality the pain you feel everyday you realize how different you are yet still you cannot come to terms with it and i fear it is tearing you apart inside in no way is it your fault either these are characteristics of the disease you feel like you constantly dying and coming back has something to do with a divine source and the connection you feel you have is unbreakable in all actuality you are living in your imagination instead of more typically produced visual hallucinations you are exhibiting a reverse behavior with full on fantasy dream like sequences that slowly destroying you
683287 i appreciate everything you have done for me thus far telling me i was depressed and giving me all of the bull shit trial and error drugs you give every person that walks through those doors and sits down to pour their heart out on you
683288 oh look at her i think i just found a new crush
683289 god she is so hot look at those tits so big not to mention an ass like an oversized novelty clock
683290 yeah those things are cool but really what does the shape of her body matter for all we know she might be some kind of psychotic beyond fixing
683291 you know i am on a lot medication it offends me when you say shit like that you are just so different today almost like a robot took over for you still taking you meds and everything
683292 i sold some of it to patrick although that doesnt matter and i
683293 why doesnt that matter that shit could really fuck him up you know he started drinking a lot because of his girlfriend
683294 well i told him i just didnt want to talk to him any more see i have instant refills on my medicine for the next few months i have a plan to just blast myself so full of them that i get a medicine hangover and never need them again much like a bad alcohol hangover can do for someone make them realize they never need another drink again that feeling of getting sick its so awful why subject yourself to multi colored vomit and a ton of wasted money
683295 you know i have been through so much too much almost i barley hung on i met you and felt like i had met someone that really got who i was someone that could relate on a scale of 1 to insane i should have known meeting you in the psyche ward what a goddamned mistake you would be you dont care about your friends or your relationship you care about you whatever happened at that appointment that you wont tell me about must have really fucked with your head you arent you anymore

683516 perfect it wont cost me an arm and a leg to call him
683517 doesnt your plan cover long distance calls anywhere in canada
683518 then can you explain why im being charged for calls made to the yukon last time i checked it was still in canada
683519 oh because of extra costs involved sprint now charges an extra fee for calls to the yukon nwt and nunavut
683520 hhhmm you didnt charge me on my last statement so its obviously very new can you tell me how sprint informed its customers of this change there was nothing indicated on my last bill i even read the fine print and there were no leaflets in the envelope i didnt see anything informing me that your rates have changed
683521 our rates havent changed maam its still only xx to call anywhere uh i mean almost anywhere in canada
683522 the family the secret fundamentalism at the heart of american power
683523 bloggers are just opportunist some times they just jumped into writing all kinds when they know just a little piece of information
683524 but he has gone to the police this time round
683525 i bet what he told the police is what we already knew speaking of which my good news have arrived a2 tell me you have that for me
683526 how could i be the leader with a tarnished name
683527 again i must say that position is up to you two to fight it over im just the transient and now you two are on equal ground
683528 you two mustnt forget how you got to where you are
683529 arrr then things wouldnt have been so interesting would it in any case this golden seat is up for grab again
683530 i have never wanted this seat i rather be in the background and taking things easy and be able to sip tea every day at 3pm but you a2 my love took the wrong step 10 years ago for that mistake you have bring upon yourself the competition with our dear friend here
683531 i still cant believe it that m1 would put me in that spotlight back then and you still refused to tell me how you deflected and not involved in the case
683532 and your ways are costing us alot of money that pis demand for 5 star hotel at timbuktu with his families is hurting my bank account
683533 and hiding that employee of mine is not an easy task too
683534 and you two are on even ground now a2 when you came to me about your ambition of taking over from m1 ive told you to be careful and youve paid your dues and when you tried to go behind my back this is your due luckily i love you else you would have been gone and n2 dont you for a second think that i dont know what youd in mind and what happened to the model thats your due
683535 when my name is cleared yours will too its unfortunate that i have to play the demure card the people will not like me but they wont dislike me too at the end of the day and i can continue on having my afternoon tea
683536 with m1 continue on talking to the press you wont have your peace
683537 m1 is just an old hag bitter over how his plan didnt turn out the way he wanted he realized his mistake back then far too late when he handed over this golden seat to me and now he simply bitter that hes not invited to tea he can say all he wants hes never our problem to begin with
683538 snap out of it we are in the modern century accept us as who we are
683539 and when the time is right ill let the police know that everything would be okay
683540 after ive dealt with k1 and well be back on our original plan a2 being pm n2 being president of this party i long have detached myself
683541 goddamn i cant believe she just said that and yes shes right

683544 dari 120 perusahaan obat baru 5 perusahaan yang telah mengajukan sertifikasi halal
683545 belum ada satu pun obat resep dokter yang mendapatkan sertifikat halal
683546 hal ini disebabkan belum ada dukungan dari pemerintah tidak ada undang undang yang mengatur pencantuman label halal masih bersifat sukarela sedangkan mui tidak berwenang mengenai hal tersebut
683547 ini disebabkan kurangnya dukungan dari pemerintah terhadap upaya perlindungan konsumen dari produk produk yang mengandung bahan tidak halal
683548 para ulama sepakat membolehkan penggunaan obat obatan dan vaksin yang mengandung babi jika jika dalam kondisi darurat
683549 selain itu masyarakat muslim menuntut obat dan kosmetika yang digunakan harus halal
683550 kebutuhan dan tuntutan masyarakat makin tinggi terhadap obat dan kosmetika yang tidak saja harus aman bermutu dan bermanfaat tetapi juga harus halal hal ini merupakan tantangan sekaligus peluang bagi dunia usaha di indonesia dan negara negara islam
683551 sayangnya tidak semua dokter mengerti tentang isi obat sementara konsumen muslim kurang diberi akses untuk mengetahui jenis dan merek apa obat yang akan diberikan pada mereka terutama pasien rawat inap
683552 sebanyak 120 produsen obat obatan belum memiliki sertifikat halal baru lima produsen obat dan satu produsen kosmetik yang sudah mendapat sertifikat halal dari mui
683553 walaupun bentuknya hanya media cangkang obat atau kapsul perlu diteliti apakah dia menggunakan bahan yang halal atau haram
683554 hey do you know if i can check yahoo mail here
683555 well i just thought that if the company server is down maybe people can still send emails to my yahoo account
683556 if i made his money you could piss on me for 48 mins i would not care
683557 there are court decisions saying people can put up signs on their own properties and to me this ordinance is a clear infringement on freedom of speech
683558 came to us as a recommendation from our economic development committee
683559 i certainly dont want to restrict peoples rights to express their political views
683560 my understanding was the restrictions applied just to campaign signs posted on public property as a way to reduce litter after an election
683561 people have the right to put up signs on their own property
683562 the only signs that are all over town now are obama signs

683568 if i can play anything from the summer of love for you what might that be
683569 if you really wanted to get my heart with my all time song youd play this one but you might not know it have you ever heard
683570 too bad the people here are only doing songs from one decade and so i shared with them a pass code to allow for requests from any decade and the first thing one of the others says is
683571 oh man you are the one who changed up blackbird that was cool where did you get the permission to do that
683572 come te una cosa speciale la ragazza magari ce lhai e quanche volta hai gi fatto con lei

683576 depois de a gente jantar ver um pouco de tv e tal a gente ficou sentado na cozinha s eu e ela olhando pro nada

683578 o pentecostes foi o dia de emposse do esp rito santo como divino administrador da igreja e toda a administra o da igreja est entregue a ele at que cristo volte na gl ria do segundo advento

683585 antes do pentecostes eram devotos por m vencidos no entanto depois do pentecostes os covardes tornaram se corajosos os cora es antes inflados de rivalidade e suspeita foram cheios de humildade e amor
683586 qualquer pessoa que se tenha rendido em f e obedi ncia ao senhor jesus cristo foi batizada no esp rito santo

683843 its very expressive of myself i just lump everything in a great heap which i have labeled the past and having thus emptied this deep reservoir that was once myself i am ready to continue
683844 so i have changed to caricature it is daddy when he was a young man

683851 he was at the end of his concert and had just started to dedicate the song and then he just lost it completely
683852 he said the word mother and just couldnt go any further
683853 a back up singer the dj and a guitar player came over to console him it looked like he might collapse he just couldnt continue he just stood there in a spotlight crying while the band continued playing
683854 i felt that he missed what to me is the peculiar charm of chopin and again i had the vague sensation so slight that it almost escaped me that the two hands did not quite synchronize
683855 a not uncommon problem very nicely described here hard to say over the internet exactly what it is but i am thinking that the problem in this case may lie further
683856 operas at the highest european level and with the most eminent singers of his time
683857 it was a reluctant roman who returned to a stockholm that had neither opera house nor public concerts
683858 i think the pursuit of authenticity is fine theres nothing against it but its not the only way
683859 i think playing bach on the harpsichord in a harpsichordy manner is fine but there must be room for playing bach on a piano as well
683860 but perahia is adamant that the music can be transmitted on an instrument of our day
683861 to many others the tone of the piano is preferable to that of the harpsichord and lets not forget we are talking about an hour and a quarter of music hands on heart can you listen to the harpsichord that long
683862 yogurt scent around the room at first i thought that the fragrance was coming from my latest batch of homemade yogurt but after a while it became clear that the smell was emitting from noah

683909 like being taken in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular physical activity
683910 these kids dont know what its like not to be fat
683911 and changing bad eating behaviors is always harder than preventing them in the first place
683912 fatness isnt about being stupid or lazy its about knowing what to do and there are a lot of things people can do
683913 weve done everything to go out of our way to be honest
683914 were taking a very different approach than the fad diets people are constantly exposed to
683915 the problem with diet pills is that no pill will work on its own
683916 you cant sit in front of the tv every day and lose weight youve also got to eat a low calorie well balanced diet and get exercise
683917 other manufacturers dont have to prove safety or effectiveness to the fda
683918 no studies are done on them and what manufacturers put in the drug isnt regulated either
683919 i would rather work with someone one on one to change some aspects of their diet and help them make realistic changes
683920 the problem is that with so many stands some in fairly close proximity to each other and possibly occupied by an inexperienced hunter who might become excited and shoot at anything that moves the risk of an accident is considered to be too great to allow hunters to pussy foot around on the ground
683921 the commissioner may issue a license under this chapter only to a person who operated a commercial large game shooting area during the period beginning october 1 1999 and ending march 15 2000 and only for the game offered for harvesting within that area during that time period
683922 you should be aware that the homestead lodge has not obtained approval from the maine land use regulation commission for the operation of such a commercial business as is required
683923 i had planned this five years ago and i am in hopes that you will issue me this license
683924 enclosed is a check for 1000 for the large game shooting area license
683925 i would greatly prefer to help the deer farming large game shooting industry to strengthen and thrive
683926 exempt a person from the provisions of chapter 739 to title 17 chapter 42 subchapter iii maines animal cruelty laws
683927 a person including an owner or the owners agent is guilty of cruelty to animals if that person kills or attempts to kill an animal by a method that does not cause instantaneous death
683928 the ethical sportsmanlike and lawful pursuit and taking of any free ranging wild native north american big game animal in a manner that does not give the hunter an improper advantage over such animals
683929 trophy animals placed in a harvest operation should exhibit their natural flight instinct

683931 chronic wasting disease cwd is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy tse affecting elk and deer cervids as well as moose in north america
683932 the infectious prion believed to cause chronic wasting disease seems to remain viable for years and can only be killed by incineration at temperatures exceeding 1 110 degrees or by a bleach bath
683933 experts fear that cwd may reach crisis levels due to its resistance to eradication
683934 some scientists including valerius geist theorize that deer in colorados research facility first contracted the disease through contact with scrapie infected sheep
683935 right now sportsmen are blessed with good access and use of both parks and public lands managed by the departments of conservation and inland fisheries and wildlife
683936 through education and presenting to others the values associated with such things as ethical hunting will do far more to preserve our good clean hunting heritage than cramming another law down the throats of people that will accomplish little if anything these are the tactics used by the anti hunting and animal rights crowd
683937 treading on the toes of ranchers and landowners by threatening their property rights is a sure way to instill bad relations between the outdoor sportsman and the landowner whom we all know without them we have less land to hunt on
683938 no one has an absolute right to use his land in a way that may harm the public health or welfare or that damages the quality of life of neighboring landowners or of the community as a whole
683939 prohibits a person from offering another person the opportunity to hunt wound or take any mammal that is intentionally confined tied staked caged or otherwise restrained from engaging in normal movement

683941 guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten thousand dollars nor more than twenty five thousand dollars
683942 the general assembly hereby finds determines and declares that this act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace health and safety
683943 the licensee may not allow the shooting of game animals or alternative livestock
683944 while penned hunts are certainly unethical from a fair chase point of view the fact remains that not everyone adheres to the same set of ethics nor should they and since owning farming and killing elk in pens for pleasure does not directly infringe on the equal rights of others banning its practice is indeed a violation of the property rights of those ranchers it serves precedence over
683945 contrary to assertions made by game farmers in the weeks before the election i 143 would not constitute a violation or takings of private property rights
683946 advances legitimate non illusory state interest in protecting montana wildlife
683947 it is rational to claim that fee killing would have negative effects on montanas fair chase hunting ethic
683948 montana does have a legitimate interest in banning fee killing of game farm animals
683949 rather it is the mere shooting and killing of animals that lack any means of escape
683950 rendered insensible to pain by a single blow or gunshot or an electrical chemical or other means that is rapid and effective before being shackled hoisted thrown cast or cut or by slaughtering in accordance with the ritual requirements of the jewish faith or any other religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter
683951 there shall be no private ownership of live animals classified in this act as big or trophy game animals or of any wolf or wolf hybrid
683952 to protect the public against health and safety risks that exotic animals pose to the community and to protect the welfare of the individual animals held in private possession
683953 knowingly transfer transport or possess in interstate or foreign commerce a confined exotic mammal for the purpose of allowing the killing or injuring of that animal for entertainment or the collection of a trophy
683954 this act is limited in its purpose and will not limit the licensed hunting of any native mammals or any native or exotic birds
683955 this is sensible legislation that is backed by responsible hunters animal protection advocates wildlife scientists environmentalists and zoological professionals the boone and crockett club and the izaak walton league of america nationally recognized hunting clubs have policy positions affirmatively opposing canned hunts in addition this legislation is supported by the humane society of the united states the doris day animal league the fund for animals and the animal protection institute
683956 every state in the country already has laws prohibiting inhumane conduct toward animals
683957 in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce knowingly transfers transports or possesses a confined exotic animal for the purposes of allowing the killing or injuring of that animal for entertainment or for the collection of a trophy
683958 must provide a transport tag for each large game animal killed in that area
683959 maine residents and out of state tourists are drawn to our special events and our wildlife and conservation education programming for children

684023 the prime minister lacks the public or political legitimacy to continue with the negotiations
684024 from the moment he announced he was stepping down he is only considered as the caretaker what legitimacy does he have to reach an agreement with the palestinians or with syria that the next government would be bound to

684267 we believe this case to be controlled by the supreme court in taylor
684268 i t is important to us that the debtor valued the business equipment at 10 718 and claimed an exemption in the same amount such an identical listing put the trustee on notice that the debtor intended to exempt the property fully at that point had the trustee doubted the debtors valuation of her business equipment he should have had the property appraised and or sought a hearing pursuant to rule 4003 c alternatively if he was not able to seek an appraisal within rule 4003s 30 day time limit he could have requested an extension before that deadline passed but once rule 4003s 30 day period elapsed without the trustee filing an objection or a request for an extension the property became fully exempt from the bankruptcy estate regardless of its ultimate market value
684269 w e read taylor to mean that where the debtor signals her intention to exempt certain property in its entirety by listing an identical entry for the propertys value and the amount of the exemption the trustee must object pursuant to rule 4003 lest the property be rendered fully exempt

684307 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
684308 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
684309 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
684310 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
684311 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
684312 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
684313 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
684314 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
684315 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
684316 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
684317 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign
684318 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
684319 it may be that a contributing factor in the crash is that he did not have the proper training to fly
684320 theres a natural tension and we cant be everywhere at once but we are maintaining the safety of the system and integrity of the certificates by checking up on them
684321 you can fly from ranch to ranch and no one ever knows
684322 there is no way to regulate that because there is no way to tell especially if youre flying under the radar if you do that then no one knows youre there
684323 senator mccain believes you cannot tax your way into social security solvency
684324 if you want to deal with social security youve got to deal with all the moving parts that is whether or not you allow young people to invest or have an account in their own name do you adjust the age do you adjust reschedule the benefits based on upper income people john is not going to tax our way into solvency because it will ruin the american economy but to raise taxes to save social security from bankruptcy wont happen its a dumb idea
684325 now graham has an idea that makes some republicans throw up raise the current 90 000 limit on income subject to social security taxes republicans who throw up should grow up intelligent people can differ about whether grahams suggestion is economically unwise or politically imprudent however it hardly blurs the distinction between conservatism and bolshevism the social security tax rate has been increased 20 times in 70 years and the cap on income subject to the tax is indexed to average wages and adjusted annually
684326 one group of stocks that has always intrigued us are those whose symbols have one letter
684327 odd as this idea may at first seem it actually makes some sense for a deep value investor these are often old line companies with well known brand names in some cases the single letter symbols were awarded many decades ago
684328 but the company subsequently suffered along with its customers in the communications and technology sectors
684329 however giants are not particularly nimble and citicorp has struggled in the new credit environment that began a year ago the new management team will probably divest many businesses but they have a good core on which to rebuild
684330 management has been quick to react laying off workers and shutting down plants we think the brand is strong enough to survive and so does legendary investor kirk kerkorian who has been buying ford shares as they drop
684331 but the headwinds of rising costs for corn and wheat have spooked investors leading to a sharp selloff in the shares earlier this year as a result the stock trades near levels reached in 1997 this may be an opportunity to get an iconic brand at a bargain price
684332 and now fearful of rising inflation and constrained consumer spending investors have sold the stock off to a nearly 5 year low macys has the financial strength to ultimately prevail and at current valuations 0 4x sales and below book value it could be cheap
684333 after rallying to nearly 46 in its first few weeks the stock declined sharply and has bounced around the 20 level for the last several months while its operating history is short netsuites products look interesting and with 170 million in cash the company has time to prove itself
684334 qwest provides telephone services in 14 western and midwestern states the company is at a disadvantage to some of its peers because it doesnt have its own wireless business
684335 but that said the old wireline franchise still has a lot of value as they figure out how to send more data and video over the phone lines
684336 a new management team is aggressively pursuing new marketing schemes as well new technology such as wimax if results dont improve some or all of the company could be sold
684337 the company services some 60 million local phone lines 15 million broadband subscribers and 71 million wireless customers
684338 as merger related charges begin to wane and synergies begin to payoff operating results should begin to improve the companys financials are sound quite capable of supporting a share repurchase program and attractive dividend
684339 i made some mistakes at the last corner but i still took the victory my bike has been very good this weekend and i was pleased to win at brands hatch its like a second home and i want to say thanks to the british fans
684340 my first sensation was that it was a little tiny bear but what a bully
684341 i found myself down on the ground i heard chomp chomp chomp i felt it go through my skull i felt it bite through this eye
684342 i heard kind of a squishy crunchy pop i went there goes my eye then it got a hold of my face and started shaking you know worrying it i could feel it tearing off i could feel the blood the wetness i could see it dripping i could hear it whooshing and i think the one thing that was most vivid to me was watching that little bugger spit my teeth out
684343 i went you know if the dogs are willing to make the sacrifice the least that i could do is make an effort
684344 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me
684345 halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe hard and it worked
684346 i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many

684352 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
684353 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
684354 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
684355 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
684356 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
684357 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

684359 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
684360 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract

684375 any club level woman can keep getting the ball over the net
684376 there are opportunities to profit in all activities but success is dependent on timing and individual competence
684377 you may never know what results come out of your action but if you do nothing there will be no result
684378 if you want to be successful find someone who has achieved the results you want and copy what they do and youll achieve the same results
684379 the person who sends out positive thoughts activates the world around him positively and draws back to himself positive results

684505 no deber an tardar m s de dos meses de obra
684506 no es el objetivo que los restaurants coloquen m s mesas en la vereda porque ya tienen un rea determinada en metros cuadrados

684518 we have been concerned about the continuing reports of abductions disappearances the detention of some people and reports of intimidation against the media

684520 we have made it clear we are concerned about the human rights situation here
684521 we stand with the people of sri lanka who fight terrorism and we understand people need to go on with their lives safely free from bombings on busses and shopping malls attacks in the streets
684522 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
684523 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
684524 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
684525 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
684526 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
684527 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
684528 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
684529 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
684530 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
684531 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
684532 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
684533 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested
684534 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins
684535 a coalition service member was killed and another wounded when their convoy struck an ied improvised explosive device this morning in kabul
684536 the two sides agreed to coordinate their efforts to stop cross border terrorism

684538 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
684539 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
684540 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer

684542 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign

684545 we have now collected the pieces of nine dead women and still there are other parts scattered

684547 the government will be working as normal and we have no worries about those who resigned

684550 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
684551 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
684552 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
684553 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
684554 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
684555 but it also guarantees the right of all paraguayans to have access to a piece of land
684556 there is a pent up demand in paraguay that has been barely satisfied
684557 im concerned there may be a little wishful thinking as to how easily it can be done
684558 if a month passes or a month and a half or two months
684559 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
684560 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
684561 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
684562 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
684563 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
684564 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
684565 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
684566 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
684567 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
684568 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
684569 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
684570 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
684571 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
684572 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
684573 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
684574 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
684575 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
684576 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
684577 i tell them to first explain about the disease how its transmitted how it cant be transmitted what it is
684578 and then they should tell them with confidence that they have it if they want
684579 i was living in a tent and i dont have that much money in prison at least my children have something to eat
684580 but when a mother is in prison for the murder of the father the lives of these children outside im not sure its a good alternative either
684581 if i let my daughter go to live with her uncle he may sell her to someone i will never let him sell her
684582 to whom can i send the children if they go outside
684583 im worried about them having to spend five more years here while they are sick
684584 i try to push her but she cant even stand on her own feet
684585 there is no open place for them to play there is no park they are living with their mothers inside the prison in the room
684586 if a child is breastfeeding it is necessary to be with the mother but there are some children who are 10 11 13
684587 if i go outside i can help my sister cook and wash the clothes i can study go to the mosque study the quran and when i come home i can help my sister wash the dishes
684588 i cant let my children be taken to an orphanage because i have many enemies who may kidnap them
684589 some of my enemies are even in prison and they ask about me if my children were in an orphanage i would not feel that they were safe
684590 it has never been done before i doubt it will be repeated this is it weve got a golden opportunity to fast forward our research
684591 i immediately jumped off my seat i thought this is what ive been waiting for i said thank god for the olympics for me this is 10 times better than winning the lottery

684593 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
684594 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
684595 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities

684619 she just sat with it crying while it called out no one should have to witness that
684620 it was my fathers and my understanding that the paddocks were excluded

684624 bettman told that newspaper that the burden for revealing these loans fell on del baggio during his application process were told that the league intends to look very very carefully at the behavior of aeg and leipold who were by the way two of bettmans most militant allies throughout the lockout and canceled 2004 05 season
684625 there are rules in the constitution and by laws that regulate financial transactions between teams
684626 prevailing opinion is that bettman and the nhl look bad for not knowing that del baggio was going to morph into one time islanders owner and convicted swindler john spano right before everyones eyes but bettman looks worse for not knowing what his allies on the board were doing behind his back
684627 its pretty hard for me to comprehend that i dont look at it that way
684628 there are mixed messages on what hockey means in the u s 20 years after the gretzky trade
684629 on one hand in the last few years teams called the tampa bay lightning carolina hurricanes and anaheim ducks have won the stanley cup
684630 but on the other the nhls tv numbers in the u s are as low as most cult sports and there are plenty of good seats to be had in most of those rinks as for gretzkys legacy with the kings during the last two years the los angeles times didnt send a beat writer on the road with the team

684635 my first starting job was as a running back against umass on homecoming and we did a double reverse i went 65 yards outran a kid grady fuller who ran a sub 4 4 40 yard dash and i outran him i went around this kid like he was standing still the coaches kept rewinding it because this kid was an all american and stuff so i had the reverse for the touchdown i had two touchdowns that day and i had 85 yards on the ground and 65 in receptions for 150 and we won 42 16 or something like that
684636 i killed it was like 300 400 people there and the pictures were killing i remember going home really excited

684648 unless your name is judas a kiss is just a kiss nonetheless filmmakers cling to the smooch in the hope or the fond pretense that it might mean something more despite everything it remains the most trusted image that we have for the clinching of an erotic deal the zinger of our desires how do we feel then when a movie like in search of a midnight kiss begins with kisses loads of them exchanged between lovers who are never identified should that strike us as romantic reassurance staunchly insisting that love is all around or as a sly debasing of the currency hinting that the simple meeting of mouths is no big deal

684654 dns patching has probably slowed down because the procedure effectively requires customer facing dns servers to be segregated from the domain hosting servers
684655 most isps dont segregate the servers because it is cheaper and easier to keep them in one box there has not been a compelling reason to segregate them until now which is probably why it is taking some isps a long time to secure themselves
684656 a hacker could make a fake bank web site find a vulnerable resolver and poison its cache so that customers using that resolver are directed to the fake address instead of the bank web site
684657 the bank is aware of situation and we are quite comfortable as we have the tools in place to monitor the situation which complement our existing capability in both hawk i and two factor authentication
684658 the major it vendors have also taken appropriate steps by introducing patches to counteract this problem so we will continue to monitor the environment for any anomalies
684659 it really surprised us to discover that it also showed the four year cycle of ancient greek games including the olympic games

684661 maddenpalooza a games and music festival will take place on august 11th in pasadena and approximately 10 000 fans are expected at the stadium to get their hands on the game and hear bands like good charlotte play
684662 it seems like every year madden gets more and more realistic
684663 when i watch someone playing madden its like im watching a real
684664 madden does give you a feel for who some of the good players are
684665 the ratings and the rankings are pretty accurate you may know from playing madden that i need to watch out for that guy
684666 i know with tennessee last year id actually play the video game before going to the field
684667 its good to be able to know the players youre going to be playing against playing the video game was part of my preparation
684668 theyre going to really have fun with this game because theyre going to be able to explore the ins and outs and the behind the scenes stuff

684670 i dont think it serves anyones interests to have an oppositional situation both groups are doing their jobs and the trusts is advocacy and trying to ensure that in a heritage city such as dunedin heritage issues are managed in the context of renewal and growth
684671 if carisbrook were added to the schedule resource consent for non complying activity would need to be obtained prior to removal or demolition of the turnstile building it is by no means certain that such a consent would be granted
684672 the proposed registration may mean the turnstile building could not be removed to make way for future development
684673 damaging consequences for the finances of the owners and south dunedin
684674 vectors board currently believes its shares are undervalued by the market and therefore represent an attractive risk return proposition for its shareholders
684675 we are here today because we love dunedin and we want the councillors to know how strongly we are opposed to this proposed stadium
684676 the message is that no public money should be spent on the awatea st stadium
684677 but weve still got a lot of work to do yet
684678 not all affected people will meet the official definition of unemployed many will simply exit the labour force

684680 people who have sold their farms for dairy conversions have the money to buy quality sheep and beef farms and are finding these in the strath taieri for excellent value
684681 much of the strath taieri basin and surrounding area has good soils and climate
684682 lack of water for irrigation is the only thing holding the area back from suitability for dairy farming

684685 most banks are trying to be prudent but we would not be surprised if there is further provisioning announced by all four banks during the next 12 months beyond the 6 6 billion already forecast
684686 as the economy emerges out of a benign credit cycle increases in debt provisions are inevitable but in asbs case any losses are expected to remain relatively low
684687 i was up probably every couple of hours icing it last night i had quite a heavy workload throughout the thursday and friday at the captains run
684688 it just flared up a bit last night i kept that to myself and did a fair bit of icing and took a couple of pills and it seemed to do the trick
684689 i happened to be rooming with rangi throughout the week and he went home early so i had a room to myself i was quite fortunate no one actually knew i was hidden away like bin laden it was good
684690 its probably easy for me to say i was repaying a lot of people first and foremost it was about doing myself proud realising that i am good enough to be here i have a great family and friend network and they have been amazing over the last six to eight weeks and the coaches and team mates too they have all been supportive
684691 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen this situation we will be careful stewards of the economy and of taxpayers money
684692 on the other hand we need to keep things in perspective small operating deficits for a limited time are not the end of the world
684693 our policy focus is on lifting our prospects over the next three to five years
684694 it is a tragedy of new zealand history that previous national administrations got our country into a mess in the past through massive overseas borrowings
684695 the hurt caused to families and to small businesses when those damaging policies eventually had to be corrected was immense in our not so distant past
684696 i had to lift the lid to look inside and i just got walloped
684697 i could be dead its as simple as that if it was a little old lady i dont think they would have taken the shock
684698 she said she hadnt told me to touch it but how else could i find out
684699 then she said i accused her of trying to kill me and she hung up on me
684700 very few artists end up selling their art at a premium after it has originally been sold so its a select group of 10 the mccahons the smithers the hammonds the hoteres who it would certainly assist because they are already selling their paintings for hundreds of thousands of dollars in a nutshell its very poorly thought out
684701 there is every reason to expect wage demands to be met
684702 its time to take the handbrake off its time to turn the growth engine on
684703 as i said to you there will be modest changes to kiwisaver and well detail those quite soon
684704 we paid the bills for think big for a very long time
684705 i think its reckless and i think its gambling with the future i cannot think of anything crazier right now when world financial markets are in turmoil than to have a party like the national party go out to the people and say lets borrow more money
684706 i have been under a bit of pressure this week
684707 i dont know why that is but perhaps you lose two in a row and it makes a huge difference to your life
684708 just the way the guys played and the way they approached the game was pretty special
684709 i was probably showing a bit of emotion and probably a bit of relief as well
684710 it was a special day we had a bit of a roll for the last four years and we are developing a new team new zealand rugby is under a bit of pressure created by the world cup loss i guess
684711 and they tell me reduced interest in the game and i think everyone involved with new zealand rugby knows it the board the people who have worked for new zealand rugby the all blacks and the new zealand people wanted a big performance and it happened
684712 were inviting three architectural firms to submit concept designs and we hope to have the initial concept designs within three weeks
684713 we aim to make a selection by the end of august time is of the essence in this project
684714 so were considering all aspects of environmentally aware design including solar energy low energy consumption technology grassed roofs recycling and sound proofing double glazing is a given
684715 the existing playcentre building will need to be demolished and the ministry will find a new home for it either on the school site or elsewhere
684716 again the establishment board will be consulted on this decision
684717 will be in accordance with the ministrys construction rates for new schools the final budget would need to be approved by the minister of education
684718 it suddenly turned the area into a carnage scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area
684719 there were pools of blood everywhere i have never seen such mass killing
684720 saturday night in general we had a lot of angry drunk people out and about
684721 its disappointing people should be able to have a good night out without being harangued by drunk people by 7am on sunday wed all had enough of it
684722 we thought it would be a quiet night with a happy crowd
684723 it sounds like happy obviously had the night off and grumpy took his place
684724 by chance the police unit drove into rattray st where the vehicle was located crashed into a power pole on the corner of manse and high st
684725 three passengers were still in the vehicle but the driver fled the scene he was later found at his mothers place
684726 it was ridiculous travelling at those speeds in the city centre endangers so many people
684727 all of which any small medium business or workgroup cant do without
684728 is this what we want in our pristine valleys of clayoquot sound
684729 i would say no i would absolutely say no so i think we have to oppose all of these projects
684730 i never go to europe i never go to the queen and tell her how to be in her territory what gives the right of any other society to come here and say that to me and my chiefs
684731 give us a chance to do what we need to do on our own
684732 this is a clearcut like the old fashioned clearcuts that everybody knew would destroy watersheds would lead to erosion would lead to the siltation in our oceans in our rivers
684733 those precious places like clayoquot sound are getting fewer and fewer
684734 we see 2012 as a critical year if loads continue to grow
684735 i can understand the police going for a search warrant but i think they have given them far too much im quite shocked by it all particularly the channels it came through
684736 we were served with a search warrant and we complied with the search warrant
684737 we didnt have a choice whether we thought the information was relevant or not
684738 we are required to disclose any information that is potentially relevant to a defence lawyer
684739 the rules i am bound by are to ensure we have a trial that is not impacted by a lack of disclosure
684740 there were people sliding all over the floor all around us
684741 i pointed out many members had suffered considerable financial loss
684742 a lot of people in that age group have sacrificed a lot to save for their retirement only to find because of the negligence of directors ond managers of companies that have folded they have little chance of getting it back
684743 if these directors still have millions of dollars they should give it back if its been hard on mum and dad investors then it should be hard on them as well
684744 i was worrying about my knee and up icing it on friday night i had quite a heavy workload on thursday and friday and it flared up a bit but i kept that to myself
684745 i did a bit of icing took a couple of pills and it seemed to do the trick
684746 no one knew i was hidden away like bin laden which was good
684747 ive been in a pretty good headspace for the last four or six weeks
684748 ive been working really hard on my game and in the gym im pretty pleased with where im at
684749 ive got a great family and friend network and they have been amazing over the past six to eight weeks
684750 freedom of speech is so fundamentally important to this country that unless you support it i dont think you can call yourself english or british
684751 unless there is a representative of the public behaving inappropriately newspapers magazines and websites should be banned from publishing any details of anyones private life huge financial penalties and possible criminal action should be thrown at those publishers and individuals who break this law
684752 the public and the media have no right to follow people harrass people take photographs of people or publish stories about them the only exceptions to this would be if an elected represenative of the public e g mp or mep behaves in a way that is unfitting of the responsibility that they have been given
684753 looks great how much do you weigh looks like you are running about 17 18 blocks good body comp and kicking performance two main issues are controlling blood sugar during handball and as always recovery something i have found to be helpful is repartitioning up to 1 2 of ones carb blocks to the post workout meal lets say you are 18 blocks that would put you at say 4 5 blocks of protein and 8 10 blocks of carbs i would make those carbs come from mainly yam or sweet potato to optimize muscle glycogen repletion and not top off the liver too much you can then puff up the fat content of other meals to finish out the day on average where you are right now we should see improved recovery and less blood sugar swings if you are doing a double day you can split that carb feeding to both post cf and post handball if the cf wod is just strength work like a back squat 1111111 i would just spread the to perform at a high level yet it is almost enough to mess with blood sugar the small snack you are taking prior to handball seems like a good idea keep cranking on that and see if this other tweak helps things at all also sleep can be a huge factor in blood sugar swings sounds like you are keeping a blistering schedule and if the sleep is skinny that can really mess with blood sugar levels how much rack time are dutch was not getting much sleep but thats not surprising considering the schedule he is keeping i admonished him to get as much sleep as he could without getting fired from his job or dumped by his girlfriend he expressed some trepidation about saving the lions share of his carbohydrates till post workout but he jumped in and did it and noticed improved energy and recovery immediately here is an email from a few weeks later i am sitting on a bus on my way back from springfield mo i was at the national collegiate handball tournament where i finished in the top 16 as with anytime you lose i feel like i should have won that is not the point of this email though even though it was difficult i was able to keep with the nutrition plan you suggested i kept carbs low until i competed then would get a couple extra carb blocks with my next meal i felt great besides losing i was worried about the crash coming halfway through a game and it never happened i am having a hard time during a normal week getting the bigger meal after training cause i am usually pressed for time and sweet potatoes dont travel very well if you have any suggestions of what i can fit into a backpack and drag to school i would appreciate them i am also starting to dabble in the kitchen and wonder if you have any good links for recipes you use i luckily havent burned down my house yet which would be bad for business since the gym is in my garage
684754 the situation has got so tough that there dont seem to be many options left for us
684755 this is my life now and i was eager to get back to it

684774 the former intelligence official went on one of the reasons i left was my sense that they bush administration were using the intelligence from the cia and other agencies only when it fit their agenda they didnt like the intelligence they were getting and so they brought in people to write the stuff
684775 he disregards the pain he inflicts on iraqi citizens refusing to comment on civilian casualties
684776 just before the march 20 2003 speech announcing the commencement of bombing iraq bush was captured on a white house monitor saying feels good
684777 68 olympics salute deserves no honor espn ignored the violent extremism behind the black power salute given by two medalists at the mexico city games
684778 the stench of self congratulation surrounding espns decision to honor smith and carlos is thicker than the air in a locker room after double overtime the argument that smiths and carlos critics must dine on their denunciations rests on an inch deep nostalgia and the triumph of celebrity culture
684779 in todays culture is it even worth trying to remind people that the black power salute was for those who brandished it most seriously a symbol of violence rhetorical political and literal against the united states it was the high sign for a racist militia the black panthers which orchestrated the murder of innocents and allied itself with americas enemies
684780 public enemy number 1 and set out a plan to kill their leaders and destroy their organization
684781 but even a more benign view of the salute shouldnt obscure the intense contradictions of espns decision to honor carlos and smith
684782 including jesse owens and jackie robinson to be uncle toms
684783 i do support the individuals who decided to make the sacrifice by giving up the chance to win an olympic medal i respect their courage we need to understand the reason and frustration behind these protests it was different in my day perhaps we lacked courage
684784 another important distinction that should matter is that this was 1968 not 1938
684785 but the question is not and never has been whether the olympic ideal can be achieved but whether it should be pursued by embracing those who spat on that idea it seems espn thinks the answer is no
684786 i dunno but lets make a deal if i die first ill come back and tell you if theres baseball in heaven and if you die first you do the same
684787 thats great what news could be bad enough to ruin that
684788 taiwans housing prices will rise 5 10 annually through 2010 at least according to construction company and real estate brokerage executives speaking at a
684789 others noted that the olympics in beijing in 2008 would not only boost chinas economy but the economies of other countries in the region as well and that taiwans real estate market would be among those benefiting
684790 furthermore as the ghost month has arrived more sellers are expected to lower prices to attract buyers in the chinese culture ghost month is the month of july on the lunar calendar which this year lasts from aug 1 to aug 30 most people are hesitant to buy houses during this period
684791 most sellers lowered their prices in the hope of getting rid of their property as soon as possible due to the
684792 we are children of the same god look at us and remember
684793 i suppose now mark youre gonna lecture us about rigged voting hey little dolt
684794 im not talking about that im referring to all the executive orders and legislation your heroes in the white house have put in place that make it a cinch if they so choose to declare martial law lock up dissenters and thus dispense with even faux balloting
684795 theres an obvious problem with your hallucination theres nowhere to house thousands of traitors excuse me
684796 in january 2006 halliburtons then subsidiary kbr was handed a 385 million government contract to per a crowing press release
684797 thatll make those terrorists think twice about rushing the border
684798 you mean the hordes of canadians breathlessly poised to overrun america with their deadly hockey sticks
684799 forget the emergency influx of immigrants ruse whats this rapid development of new programs the swift incarceration of thousands of americans protesting the imposition of martial law perhaps
684800 i wish i were imagining things unfortunately horrors like domestic detention facilities are but one verifiable piece of an all encompassing all intrusive system bushco has methodically installed to take unchallenged control of america instantly
684801 hes not bad i guess you know for an iraqi i even loaned him five bucks the other day
684802 then youd better hope his views of what the bushies are doing to his country are in line with theirs otherwise under dubyas
684803 thats your concern ahmeds suddenly suspect appearance rather than yet another insanely vague executive order
684804 your anti americanism mark blinds you to seeing that anyone could be a terrorist you just never know and unfortunately theres no machine that can look into peoples hearts
684805 maybe i should call and apply as a scanner operator heh heh
684806 knock yourself out just pray tsa hasnt out sourced its call center to say india because under the new fisa bill any message you send to or receive from overseas is fair game for the government warrant or probable cause be damned ill bet apolitica would love to hear that tape played in court
684807 this bill is thoughtcrime codified establishing a national commission to provide legislative recommendations for stopping those peskily ubiquitous homegrown terrorists from among other things developing and spreading within the united states the use planned use or threatened use of force or violence by a group or individual to promote the group or individuals political religious or social beliefs
684808 not much i guess other than its so broadly and absurdly written that anyone at a demonstration for example could be deemed a terrorist
684809 like all those ones youve attended i think ill call my senator tomorrow to push that bill unlike certain america haters i know i believe in doing everything possible to defeat evildoers
684810 why wait why not instead ask your boss if hes one of the who according to matthew rothschild of the progressive preferentially receive secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does if so then maybe you too could attend infragard meetings like that at which one participant reported he and others were told by homeland security and the fbi that when not if martial law is declared it was our responsibility to protect our portion of the infrastructure and if we had to use deadly force to protect it we couldnt be prosecuted does that not get your attention
684811 absolutely it sounds like an even better gig than eyeballing nudie shots of airline passengers uh i mean performing confidential inspections in the name of national security ok you two lets go
684812 sorry to ruin your day but i gotta help my boss install a new grill over at the sloppy burger
684813 hey dolt do you think after you two hook that thing up youll eventually end up cooking burgers on it
684814 of course why would anyone go to all the trouble to put something in place and then not use it
684815 i have reason to know the kids who were involved the families who were involved and ive never known them to harbor this type of feeling
684816 build confidence and trust among nations through collective maritime security efforts that focus on common threats and mutual interests
684817 the u s military maintains jurisdiction over its bases which cover approximately 39 000 acres 160 km or 29 of the islands total land area
684818 us naval forces marianas oversees the us navys largest and most strategic island base located in the western pacific it is home to over 160 000 residents and more than 12 000 military members and their families guam is the most populated island in the geographical area known as micronesia
684819 once upon a time you could trace the spread of imperialism by counting up colonies americas version of the colony is the military base
684820 oconnors mentor in spirit josef goebbels must be laughing in his grave
684821 believes that the wiesenthal center supports deceptive fools like oconnor to appease its wealthy leftist supporters if that is true and of course no offical sic at the center would own up to it it is shameful
684822 looking ahead liberals are determined to derail potential opposition to their plans to accelerate the deconstruction of america consequently they have targeted talk radio bringing back the fairness doctrine is just one facet of their scheme to eviscerate the only part of the media controlled by conservatives
684823 the left will do anything to gag its opponents from the college campus to the halls of congress think campus speech codes think hate crimes legislation think speech suppression zones surrounding abortion clinics liberals are the chief proponents of censorship in america
684824 they use the guise of not being politically correct to ratchet up their anti gay anti woman and overtly racist language
684825 i wonder how i hmm you are amazing in a good way i dont lays
684826 the old priest and father karras were about to exorcise the demon

684832 i never did a lot of roasting on the grill and one day i decided to learn about making some larger cuts of meat by roasting them wisconsin a citizens group will hand out free reusable shopping bags on saturday to every home in shorewood
684833 i also wanted it to be small enough that like the mcdonalds patty it would fit in the bun with everything else
684834 joe girardi was saying hes had the opening day line up only four or five times but there wont be a lot of teams weeping for the yankees injury problems
684835 the yankees have everything right in front of them can they make a run of course they can theyve done it in the past more importantly theyve got to get good starting pitching every single day theyve got it from mike mussina theyve got it from andy pettitte joba chamberlain of course everyone knows about him out there most importantly theyve got to get a good start every fifth day if they can do that than once their offense starts clicking they can win 10 or 11 straight thats how good they can be
684836 you have a guy that goes out there and leads the league in era every time justin duchscherer goes on the mound you feel like you have a real good chance to win he does a great job of giving our bullpen a break and pitching deep in the game and just feel like we dont need to get too many runs when hes out there
684837 robinson cano has been outstanding hitting 340 the last month hes been really hot since the break and had four hits yesterday saturday hes really hitting the ball hard even his outs are line drive outs so were excited about the way hes swinging the bat
684838 the coaches and managers today show up at the ballpark at 11 or 12 in the morning for a night game they are on those computers looking at data to see how they can catch an edge its a much different job than when i played 25 years ago you have to really have big shoulders and thick skin and be able to get very insular just be with your ball club and block out all that outside stuff that happens in this town
684839 that is an ill advised play you should never slide head first into first base luckily andy pettitte didnt step on his finger but nice job by the veteran left hander to get over there and get to speedy gonzalez
684840 a lot of you youngsters in the summertime go to a lot of clinics to learn how to play this game well this man andy pettitte right here is putting on a clinic if you want to learn how to pitch to both sides of the plate the thing about andy that you like is he has such command of the outside corner hes thrown more change ups than ive seen him throw in a long time on the left handed hitters hes really been going with fastballs and sliders away and occasionally that standard beautiful cutter that he throws down and in to the right handed hitter that is just impossible for them to lay off
684841 jason varitek adds a lot to that boston mystique hes been their biggest team leader hes their captain but if you start thinking as a general manager that i should give contracts based on past service than youre in harms way you should give it based on what jason can bring to your team and if that means that the captain thats hitting 214 deserves a two year contract with options that kick in if he plays a certain amount of games than i think thats a good thing
684842 i think that jonathan papelbon got new yorked because some of the comments that he made i think that he was saying as an athlete he would have been proud to close the all star game but of course it belonged to mariano rivera who pitched excellently in that all star game rivera what do you say about him just the greatest postseason closer greatest reliever of all time
684843 yo tengo una propuesta constructiva y es la que les voy a presentar
684844 im proud that ive won on every tour basically i havent won a world golf championship so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into the next week

684847 the course is playing great the pins were a little easier than they were yesterday and the greens were a little softer
684848 the pins were just not as crazy i think the usga kind of listened to some guys and they did a good job with the setup
684849 some of them yesterday were on the side of slopes and if you got anywhere above the wrong side of the hole you were going to be 20 feet past no matter what
684850 today they are a lot more accessible but they are still tough
684851 i think tomorrow the key is going to be the front nine the group of guys that goes out there and lights it up on the front
684852 i started playing good two months ago im doing very well my putter is working now when i miss well im still with good concentration but im happy with my putting

684855 they are starting to mildew and rats and bugs are getting in there and destroying them
684856 i guess they just threw them in here because they had nowhere else to put them or they just didnt care
684857 its something to be proud of but its not a 54 hole tournament thats not what im here for
684858 its weird because most weeks on tour theres probably 20 guys or 10 guys who can win on the last day
684859 but obviously if parker is 20 under john rollins has to shoot 10 under if parker is even par so it does put a stretch on everyone including me
684860 but parkers never won before so you never know he might shoot a couple over and around this golf course anything can happen you can hit good shots and get a bad bounce and be really in trouble
684861 it was my first time having a lead and i didnt really approach it the right way and learned a lot from it
684862 that one i looked past the finish line too early and this one im looking forward to the first shot on the first hole tomorrow and thats as far as im going to go
684863 ive been here for so many years now ive sort of got a rhythm to this place
684864 probably a lot more demand for tickets yeah im comfortable familiar its good to be here
684865 its a good golf course and obviously for family reasons its great for them so im very pleased
684866 its one of those things that if i dont get the ball in the fairway here its hard for me to score
684867 im not exactly the best of rough players and when i have longer clubs and irons out of the rough into these greens its very very difficult that was frustrating
684868 im really disappointed it seems like ive done that a lot here put myself in position going into the weekend three or four times already now
684869 it was fun to pitch here because it was a reminder of good times for me its a matter of focusing on what i do not the results it was like pitching in little league again when you dont have to worry about contracts and things

684888 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
684889 i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen
684890 it worked out for me im very very glad to secure the victory
684891 we had the speed in the race its qualifying where we must sort it out
684892 we need to get something sorted my car is fast and we need to just get in the front to use it
684893 i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tire halted my progress
684894 i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
684895 when i saw the car on fire on the straight the smoke i thought it could be felipe but couldnt believe it
684896 i just tried not to do any mistakes and stay in front of him
684897 i didnt expect the podium its just the perfect weekend
684898 the jam format was great if you were in the zone and i was definitely in the zone
684899 i wanted to go for it but i just played it safe and ended up second i threw in some flip tricks but it was just a matter of staying consistent

684937 axis is looking at syariah compliant reit to have a wider pool of investors who can invest in the trust
684938 we expect to achieve break even cash flow by the middle of next year
684939 we are lucky as our outlets are in a prime location we have been well received by shopping complex owners and thus it is not impossible to recover our investment by the end of this fiscal year
684940 since our listing in 1997 we have grown our apparel business and one of our goals is to diversify our business into a full fledge lifestyle company
684941 as such we see the food and beverage business through theobroma chocolate lounge as a natural extension of our operations
684942 if we carry on as we are today without deploying new technologies or establishing less energy intensive ways of working and living the expected impact on carbon concentration in the atmosphere could rise to 1000 parts per million over the next century and atmospheric temperatures by nearly four degrees celsius
684943 we have to be very prudent about balancing our operating expenditure and stimulating revenue through virtual products
684944 for instance celcom is able to send reloads over air instead of physical distribution to distributors
684945 over time and very quickly we will do without the vehicles by handling the business virtually there will be huge savings for us
684946 we have to swing that soon the whole distribution system must be quickly adjusted to a virtual distribution system
684947 the virtual world is a saver to cutting cost this is the way forward for celcom
684948 the residential segment seems to have reached a saturation point we are reacting to the market which is why we are moving into integrated commercial developments
684949 integrated projects offer higher profit margins we have expertise in these developments and do not see why we should not move with the flow
684950 we are launching a few commercial projects the most expensive is glomac damansara
684951 we are open to selling the towers en bloc for sustainable development the towers will attract european arab and local investors
684952 we made a handsome profit from the sale en bloc is something we will look at from now
684953 the acceptance level for the standby offer was very high but the figure is not finalised because shareholders have until september 19 to rescind their decision
684954 the lesotho and zimbabwean markets will make a significant contribution to engens vision of becoming an african champion in downstream business by 2016
684955 shell has licensed its brand to the joint venture therefore half of the retail network is shell branded this joint venture sells 172 million litres of retail and commercial fuels lubricants and aviation products mainly through retail sites
684956 engen already has interests in lesotho and the acquisition will see it secure 35 per cent of the market
684957 while zimbabwes economy has declined sharply over the last decade it still has good infrastructure which could form the basis of renewed economic growth once the political crisis is resolved
684958 commodities exports will likely remain resilient supported by continued price increases in june and recent recovery in export volumes
684959 the decline in imports partly reflects a slowdown in domestic demand and imports of intermediate goods used to produce manufactured exports
684960 it may take years but be patient dont take shortcuts and run the business properly
684961 you must choose the business that you like and have the aptitude for then learn a lot from books and other people do feasibility study due diligence before you start the business
684962 just because you have a piece of land that could save you on capital cost if the place is not suitable it can be quite useless
684963 i know of some service stations run by malays where the moment they get the cash they take it and go into other business when the money is to pay the oil supplied to them
684964 franchisors can help them locate sites and train them at the end of the day if you do things right you will succeed
684965 you have to be clear what islamic education is all about that is it must be related to the fundamental teachings of islam islam is about shaping a good person not just the five daily prayers going to mecca fasting and being charitable those are for our soul
684966 but for the community or ummah there are a lot of things that can be taught based from the quran the business should not be just to make money but use it to explain what islam is all about
684967 it is on the drawing board we expect to launch it by january 2009
684968 we are excited over these new launches and are gearing up for more next year
684969 we will be prudent with the developments and manage cost effectively
684970 due to rising costs more overseas companies will relocate their bpo to malaysia there are also abundant opportunities here as only 18 per cent of companies outsource their business processing
684971 firstly we shippers have no business or contractual relationship with the depot operators
684972 they are service providers to the shipping lines and thus they cannot claim anything from us
684973 if there is any charge it should be settled between them and the shipping lines the people who hire them to give their service
684974 secondly if hauliers chose to pay and absorb those charges then it is their business
684975 however hauliers cannot collect money on behalf of anybody that is illegal
684976 the dgc is only a minimal charge of rm5 per container and would help pay for additional manpower and electricity costs necessary to extend the operations from the current 12 hours to 24 hours of our member depot operators in line with a government decision to reduce the time that containers can stay free of charges at port klang from five to three days come january 1 2009
684977 for instance there are 19 depot operators in port klang alone of which 16 are members of mcda
684978 the 16 mcda members together command 95 per cent share of port klangs container depot market
684979 we are going for all the four tenders which close at the end of the month or early next month they are big tenders
684980 we cannot reveal the telcos name but it is one of the major players in the country we also cannot disclose the value of these contracts as their tenders are not closed yet
684981 we see a second wave of our success story coming when telekom implements a major hsbb project
684982 the government should think of manufacturing a portion of it locally so that there is a spin off to other industries namely the hardware and software portion of the equipment which is possible
684983 during that time we managed to install some 150 000 lines in ghana within three years when the country took 40 years to come with that figure
684984 when we came in they ghana had 100 000 lines and we provided an additional 150 000 lines in just three years of our presence in that african nation
684985 it is a cosmetic change to comply with scs requirement that perwaja holdings and perwaja steel start on a clean slate
684986 potential investors can rest assured that they are not buying into perwajas accumulated losses the net tangible asset is clean

684989 tribrata yang diterjemahkan sebagai loyalitas kepada negara dan pemimpinnya menghalau musuh negara menjunjung tinggi bangsa dan negara serta berdiri diatas semua golongan masih merupakan slogan yang belum dihayati dan menjadi pedoman bertindak tiap tiap anggota kepolisian negara republic indonesia sedangkan jika kita menyimak tuntutan masyarakat kepada kepolisian ternyata tak banyak yakni hanya 2 yaitu petama mengharapkan penganyoman dan perlindungan yang baik dan kedua mengharapkan pelayanan yang lebih baik dari aparat kepolisian jika mereka terpaksa berhubungan dengan polisi tapi kenapa kedua hal tersebut sulit terwujud karena selain kesadaran hokum dan disiplin masyarakat masih sangat rendah kurang juga factor mutu profesionalisme polisi belum sesuai dengan harapan meski menurut eigen er lich polisi adalah hukum yang hidup the living law karena polisi merupakan salah satu instrument negara yang dapat memaksakan berlakunya hukum demi pemulihan keadaan bersama instrument negara yang lain seperti jaksa hakim dan advokat yang sering dikenal dengan sebutan catur wangsa penegak hukum

685040 anelka jogou contra um grande clube e fazer quatro gols contra o milan fant stico para a confian a dele
685041 hoje n o foi bom por causa dos quatro gols mas porque ele jogou mais livre e com mais qualidade do que em outras partidas
685042 n o foi normal para o milan eles tinham quatro ou cinco jogadores de fora grandes jogadores de qualidade mas nosso time jogou bem e a performance hoje foi melhor do que nos quatro jogos anteriores
685043 eu tenho jogadores competitivos e de qualidade e eles lutam por lugares no campo eu tenho 22 aqui cinco em casa tenho um bom time
685044 you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free
685045 the truth will set you free but first it will shatter the safe sweet way you live
685046 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do
685047 life has become shatterings and grace shreddings and insistent uncapped love may we embrace the dichotomies and paradoxes we are now in the domain of magic and miracles a quantum existence for sure new vocabularies of words feelings movements behaviors interactions expressions are being called forth its happening
685048 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
685049 jake is telling everyone they are getting married at christmas he told me he had proposed several times but she kept telling him she wanted to give their relationship more time when he asked her again a couple of weeks ago she finally said yes
685050 if i can get paid to do that then im in
685051 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
685052 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
685053 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
685054 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
685055 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
685056 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
685057 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
685058 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
685059 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
685060 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
685061 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
685062 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested
685063 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins
685064 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
685065 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
685066 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
685067 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
685068 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
685069 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
685070 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
685071 well maybe it will as its part of a larger energy package
685072 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
685073 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
685074 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
685075 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
685076 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
685077 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
685078 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
685079 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
685080 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
685081 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
685082 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
685083 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
685084 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
685085 the church is full of willing people some are willing to work the others are willing to let them

685098 what we democrats cant afford to do even as we support senator obama is try to build one america on the cheap
685099 i voted across the racial divide i have no obligations to do something in my community or around the world
685100 t he benefit senator obama may get out of that trip may come later in the course of this campaign in ways that arent as obvious as having however many people 200 000 people or however many people showed up in berlin
685101 he should not be either discouraged or encouraged by the reaction of that trip he should internalize it it should be a thing that had merit for him in and of itself and the fact that it had very little political impact in the short run should be of no concern to anybody most voters dont have the space for it right now

685118 he is basically a liberal democrat and he is a democrat at that he runs as an independent because he doesnt like the structure and money that gets involved the bottom line is that bernie sanders votes with the democrats 98 percent of the time
685119 not only am i going to vote for john kerry i am going to run around this country and do everything i can to dissuade people from voting for ralph nader i am going to do everything i can while i have differences with john kerry to make sure that he is elected
685120 is there a moral limit to the military violence you are willing to participate in or support
685121 congress expresses the unequivocal support and appreciation of the nation to the president as commander in chief for his firm leadership and decisive action in the conduct of military operations in iraq as part of the ongoing global war on terrorism
685122 i dont think you can do a quote unquote immediate withdrawal i think the policy has got to be we will withdraw our troops as soon as possible and by that i mean that i believe we can have our troops out in the next year and maybe a significant number of them before that i dont think you can snap your fingers and just bring all the troops home tomorrow i just dont think thats practical
685123 we think we have quality politicians in vermont were wrong we have politics as usual in vermont our so called independent congressman bernie sanders cant get far enough away from impeachment
685124 because of your vote of support for the israeli actions i would hope any friends and contacts of mine would not send you funds nor give you their votes
685125 as the greatest democracy on earth we must ask why american companies are turning communist china into the new superpower of the 21st century while microsoft is saving a dollar it is helping undermine our economic and military security by gutting our manufacturing and technological infrastructure and moving it lock stock and barrel to one of our major international rivals
685126 in the sense that we are trying to develop left right coalitions we also trying to redefine american politics
685127 it is undeniable that aside from dobbs and a few politicians americas political debate is devoid of economic populists war on the middle class confronts this problem head on and thanks to dobbs passion and charisma it succeeds in sounding the alarm that cannot be ignored
685128 sometimes bernies biggest critics are on the left some social liberals quietly grumble that sanders maintains too rigid a focus on economic issues
685129 we repeatedly called on congressman sanders to join us in decrying the imposition of a death penalty trial on a state that had abolished capital punishment
685130 we asked him to participate in a press conference with other political religious and labor leaders but he declined even when we directly asked him on a public radio call in program if he would join us in saying vermont should stay death penalty free bernie wouldnt take a stand
685131 he will not leave a party behind him so what will be his legacy i dont see a next bernie on the horizon i dont see what comes after him theres a lot wrapped up in one man and i dont know where that gets you in the long run
685132 the differences between the republican and democratic parties involve no issue no principle in which the working class have any interest

685148 since i was a young girl it has been my dream to become number one in the world
685149 when you get older at least one day you can say you were number one and no one can take that away from you
685150 cp trainer 2 ok ok now it should show up something called cp trainer 2 zip or something like that now click it
685151 it had been there for many years and probably would be there for many more
685152 now i guess there might be more people making a pilgrimage to these glaciers before they go
685153 ice is almost like a species that is going extinct
685154 its the far north and the higher elevations that are seeing the impacts first
685155 and when it comes to california it doesnt get any higher than the sierra
685156 when i started doing climate change research in the sierra nevada around 1990 it seemed like an abstraction
685157 over the last five years the canary in the coal mine died
685158 its almost a shock to find out how many things are changing and how rapidly they are changing
685159 its doing this not in tens of thousands of years but in decades
685160 we are going into new territory that has not been seen in a long long time
685161 despite their imposing grandeur and apparent fortitude mountains contain highly sensitive environments that support delicately balanced physical and natural systems a warming of only a few degrees has major implications
685162 its like throwing a switch you get water or you get ice
685163 this winter there were a number of storms in yosemite valley where it was just kind of spitting snow but it never really got cold enough to snow
685164 a few degrees makes a fair amount of difference when sap starts rising plants begin to grow and insects become active
685165 it could very well be that giant sequoias become relics that survive for centuries where they are as they gradually die off and are not replaced
685166 there is going to be a great deal of nail biting there are going to be constant surprises for everyone
685167 resorts would be forced to rely entirely on snowmaking or move their operations
685168 when i was a kid i used to spend close to nine months a year in my ski boots
685169 you can only go up so far before you run out of mountain
685170 its just a single pine thats the insidious part sometimes you dont notice it because its a tree here and a tree there but there used to be a lot more there and today there are very few
685171 the less snow you have the more severe the fire becomes
685172 if the snow melts earlier the fuels are available for a longer period of time
685173 what a great experience what a jumble of fascination great ice pool
685174 there used to be a massive tongue of ice here
685175 the key thing is all the ice loss is occurring about the same time all these caves are being influenced by a common factor which is more than likely global climate change
685176 on the whole sierra nevada glaciers have retreated roughly 50 percent from a century ago
685177 if those rates continue we will probably be without glaciers in something like 50 years
685178 floats as a pale ship on a sea of desolate granite
685179 the east lobe is almost invisible you see a thin flake of ice like the stuff in a refrigerator that doesnt defrost
685180 the west lobe is more healthy but it has shriveled and shrunken the way a pumpkin does four weeks after halloween
685181 it wont be long until the lyell glacier is no more two or three more decades maybe
685182 i set out to trace the ancient ice current back to its farthest recesses
685183 a small but well characterized glacier swooping down from the somber precipices of black mountain
685184 i can only promise that we will only start work if we have complete permission of the court and the people
685185 the forest service would be on its knees except for the money congress provides
685186 this thing is pretty close to being out of control
685187 the forest service bases its budget for forest fires on wishful thinking its a constant juggling act and thats not the way it should be done

685233 after receiving the call we had some difficulty locating the family on the river
685234 the police helicopter did eventually locate the family and we arrived at the scene to find the group stranded on a small island in the river
685235 after assessing the situation it was decided the safest course of action was for them to be airlifted to the river bank
685236 they had gone out on the river in a blow up dinghy with just one paddle
685237 it has taken an awful lot of the emergency services that could have been deployed elsewhere
685238 this type of approach by the adults was very dangerous and people have to learn to respect water and rivers
685239 they should never have been out on the river in little flimsy dinghy especially with young children they have been very lucky no one drowned or was seriously hurt
685240 it beggars belief that people would think it was a good idea to go on the river with the rainfall weve been having the last couple of days
685241 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
685242 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
685243 because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain
685244 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
685245 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
685246 we have identified around 3 500 remaining temporary consents for cso discharges
685247 these are mainly for storm overflows that are operating without causing problems
685248 as you would expect our priority has always been to focus on those consents that are a problem
685249 we expect companies to be proactive in identifying intermittent discharges such as cso and emergency overflows from pumping stations that are at risk of becoming unsatisfactory
685250 we have approval for all of these granted and monitored by the environment agency
685251 we have an active ongoing programme of improving them as we can
685252 theyre a valuable asset for minimal environmental impact particularly in times of intense localised flooding

685331 we have also received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 mph and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
685332 we have strong evidence that the other driver ran a red light the case is still under investigation

685360 una de las cosas que estamos haciendo con las provincias es compartir informaci n estad stica que sirva de base para la toma de decisiones en las autoridades provinciales
685361 el promedio nacional est en aproximadamente 80 7 accidentes mientras que en la provincia se cuentan 105 accidentes cada mil trabajadores cubiertos al a o
685362 en este semestre llevamos 63 muertos de los cuales casi el 35 fueron camino al trabajo y el resto en los mbitos laborales
685363 gracias a dios dijo gaviola los siniestros que se producen est n concentrados en un grupo relativamente peque o de empresas de los 600 mil empleadores que tenemos registrados en todo el pa s en s lo 90 mil se producen accidentes
685364 en definitiva si estamos hablando de la salud de los trabajadores ellos tienen que opinar que existan estos comit s no significa que el trabajador vaya a cogestionar una empresa pero s que en los temas que hacen a su seguridad puedan opinar y hacer todas las denuncias que consideren necesarias
685365 hay que ir fundamentalmente sobre esos empleadores donde no hay justificativos econ micos para que las medidas de seguridad no se cumplan hay que hacerles un seguimiento especial
685366 vamos a hacer foco y vamos a tratar de que los recursos que le estamos dando a la provincia vayan direccionados a inspeccionar especialmente estas empresas donde primero queremos ir por las buenas pero si no hay cambios aplicaremos una pol tica punitoria que disuada
685367 hasta ahora sostuvo la seguridad en el trabajo no ha sido un tema central en la agenda de los gobiernos porque al estar en crisis la argentina estaba m s preocupada por la subsistencia que por la salud pero luego de cinco a os de crecimiento econ mico no hay justificativos para que este tema no sea un tema central

685385 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
685386 though we realize people will think barack is a cupcake for running away from a real debate with real voters asking the questions we think that it would just be too damn scary and potentially damaging for him to look the voters in the eye and try to tell them what they want to hear
685387 frankly voters are kind of a pain in the ass
685388 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider

685397 lying is not always bad to be sure there are times when telling a lie is more profitable and better for the general welfare and for the settlement of conciliation among people than telling the truth to this effect the prophet says he is not a false person who through lies settles conciliation among people supports good or says what is good

685406 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese
685407 the link between how much a person snacks while watching tv was directly related to viewing food advertisements specifically when choosing to eat an energy dense snack
685408 the exposure to the advertising seems to stimulate a desire to eat that particular food product also sitting watching tv provides a prime opportunity to snack

685514 most of those traveling to beijing this week for the olympics have likely heard of falun gong and the communist partys brutal campaign to crush it

685516 we realize the challenges facing journalists seeking to cover a taboo topic like falun gong but we hope this guide will assist them in overcoming these obstacles

685581 is conducting education and research on underwater robotics biomechanics on aquatic animals and its application to engineering computational hydrodynamics of viscous flow fields
685582 the development of an oil field in russias sakhalin and chinese economic expansion will likely lead to increased tanker traffic in japanese coastal waters the buoy is intended to be deposited along the edge of an oil slick in the sea at the time of an accident a sensor to analyze the stickiness of liquids detects heavy oil which is more glutinous than sea water
685583 once the buoy senses it is out of an area of heavy oil it automatically submerges to a depth of about 10 meters and four extremely sensitive cameras explore the surrounding area the cameras look out for the black shadow cast by oil and the buoy resurfaces in the oil slick steering using four fins it repeats this process to keep track of the oil it is able to keep searching for oil at night by turning on its lights the float utilizes the global positioning system to ascertain its position which it transmits by radio together with data on the speed of the current water temperature wind direction and wind velocity
685584 it has imaging sensors that can spot floating globs of oil from a distance as well as viscosity sensors that detect the presence of oil and it includes a wind monitor depth meter and water thermometer when multiple robots are dropped into the water at regular intervals around an oil spill they can provide a wealth of valuable data to cleanup crews and allow them to monitor a wide area
685585 once in the water sotab 1 begins searching for oil by reducing its buoyancy and diving underwater where it trains its imaging sensors back up at the surface when the robot sees something that looks like oil it readjusts its buoyancy and floats back to the surface using 4 fins to steer toward the oil slick it then takes water samples and determines how much oil is present as sotab 1 follows the oil around it sends back real time data about its location and the surrounding meteorological and oceanographic conditions
685586 we want to get the weight under 30 kilograms and extend the battery life to about 3 to 4 weeks says kato who began working on the robot in 2006
685587 said the ideal system would be to oblige tankers to have buoys on board and to automatically drop them into the sea when accidents occur a large sized tanker would be able to respond quickly to the accident should it have dozens of buoys he said kato is considering using solar batteries and tidal power xgeneration since the cells the prototype currently uses last only several hours far from the goal of three weeks he is aiming for he said the size of batteries should be made smaller to save power improve motion performance and cut down on cost

685611 i didnt think the match would have been over today i thought we could give india a better fight
685612 i didnt think the match would have been over today i thought we could give india a better fight
685613 we fought every time we were down we fought very well to come back into this test match to get six wickets this morning in quick time and restricting india to 269 was a brilliant effort that gave us a good opportunity to chase these runs down
685614 its important we get a good start in any run chase
685615 we didnt get it and being down 10 for 3 wasnt ideal
685616 the bowling unit fought really well throughout the test and created opportunities for us and kept the indians under control
685617 the disappointment was in the first innings where we should have capitalised and put more pressure on the indians
685618 we should have got a few more runs on the board we played really good cricket for two to three days and we just lost it in the last two sessions of the fourth day
685619 a quick bowler like ishant is something for us to discuss ishant is an exceptional bowler
685620 he creates a bit of bounce on these kinds of wickets thats something which india has
685621 well have a chat with the selectors we have a few options in our squad and see what we can come up with
685622 going into the fourth day or fifth day of a test match you always know that when you have to face two top class spinners the mindset would be there but we always knew that the new ball is always going to be a factor on these kinds of wickets
685623 thats where you probably can pick up a couple of wickets thilan samaraweera showed a lot of character to hang around there and batted well but it was a bit too much for him in the end
685624 i am very happy for ajantha in his second test match to pick up ten wickets he bowled brilliantly and supported the other bowlers as well
685625 the last game was brilliant we got 600 runs one game you have a bad run you just cant point fingers and say this is bad
685626 it is just that we need to figure out a way of controlling situations a bit better especially under pressure and see how we can come out of it

685655 the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
685656 there was fighting in the village a hundred times roadside bombs bombardment firing and shooting
685657 the taliban are coming during the night with heavy weapons riding on vehicles and we cannot even dare ask them to leave because if they see someone at night outside they will slaughter them and accuse them of being spies
685658 his mother was cooking and he was lying beside her
685659 the whole village was destroyed and after that we left
685660 we dont know from which side they fired but we heard that
685661 if the taliban fire from over there do you come and bomb this village
685662 we only want a stable country whether with the taliban or the foreigners
685663 if they kill if they wound innocent people we dont want them
685664 if they build and bring peace we will accept them
685665 but i will not forgive the foreigners for this crime
685666 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
685667 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
685668 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
685669 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
685670 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
685671 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
685672 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
685673 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
685674 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
685675 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
685676 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
685677 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
685678 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
685679 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
685680 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
685681 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
685682 if it takes the iconic polar bear for people to say maybe we need to do something thats a good thing
685683 the u s created the deadlock on an issue which was not trade but related to livelihood of farmers i can negotiate commerce but i cannot negotiate livelihood security
685684 it is disheartening to know that the talks collapsed over the issue of a reasonable trigger point needed to safeguard the livelihood concerns of millions of subsistence farmers in developing countries even the 10 percent import surge proposal from india and other countries was very liberal
685685 i am happy that developing countries could not be divided or pushed around but i am not that happy that the talks failed
685686 in the wto each one of the 153 member countries has a vote that does not depend on the size of the country or the volume of its international trade this ensures that the writ of the large and the powerful does not prevail and is hence good for small developing countries
685687 as food prices go up further in the u s and in europe many poor countries including quite a few in africa that are dependent on food imports would get hurt very badly leading to more poverty social tension and political turmoil
685688 why have representatives of only 30 countries been mainly involved in the geneva talks what about the interests of the remaining 123 countries the wto negotiations have become a joke
685689 whereas the rich act as bullies the emerging developing countries are not exactly holy cows who are doing a lot to improve livelihood conditions for their subsistence farmers
685690 the ability of trade to dampen country specific macroeconomic problems for example due to high food prices will be greatly reduced
685691 as long as bush has been here theres been a reason to march
685692 were all politically active in this area if there is a just cause that we believe in then were there
685693 its america if we didnt have protesters it just makes sense
685694 the march was something i discussed with the march leader jamilla and the decision was made to stop at the first checkpoint

685699 classic wisdom hasnt been serving investors that well lately for example as stocks struggle a number of prominent believers in index funds from suze orman to burton malkiel have begun to publicly question their former faith
685700 as far as whether you should adjust your portfolio allocations and put money where things are doing well thats the mistake most investors make so over time as conditions change you might very well change your allocation i would put much more in emerging markets today than i would have 30 years ago ive become a bit more positive on commodities this is probably a change in my thinking over the years

685709 atteggiamento sbagliato in una partita comunque importante non c nulla da salvare
685710 ci sono stati un atteggiamento e unattenzione sbagliati nel confronto di unamichevole importante
685711 si trattava di unamichevole importante la partita era gi difficile poi dopo il risultato di 3 0 nel giro di quindici minuti le cose si sono ulteriormente complicate la brutta figura rimane ma speriamo che le vacanze siano finite oggi non c nulla da salvare piuttosto dobbiamo guardare avanti
685712 il gioco in attacco non fa testo a causa delle numerose assenze ma dobbiamo certamente lavorare sulla fase di difesa anche se rientrer un giocatore importante come nesta non credo che lui da solo possa risolvere tutti i problemi sar necessario che tutti siano pi concentrati pi attenti in modo da concedere meno la mancanza degli attaccanti ci permetter di lavorare sulla difesa che in questo momento troppo lacunosa

685726 ero in testa tutto era a posto ma sono cose che capitano la partenza sapevo che era decisiva
685727 mi spiace per felipe io nel finale ho mollato per un problema al retrotreno
685728 sono molto frustrato in questo momento perch oggi avevo unottima macchina e avevamo fatto tutto alla perfezione fino a pochi chilometri dallarrivo purtroppo le corse possono essere crudeli
685729 successo tutto allimprovviso senza che ci fosse stato il minimo segnale spiega ancora felipe stavo gestendo la corsa perch avevo un buon margine di vantaggio sul secondo dopo che hamilton era stato attardato da un problema non stavo rischiando assolutamente nulla
685730 abbiamo dato tutto ma queste cose possono accadere ora non dobbiamo mollare ma reagire subito ci sono sette gare da disputare e 70 punti in palio c tutto il tempo per rimontare i nostri avversari sono forti ma noi abbiamo dimostrato di essere al loro livello
685731 sapevo di poter fare una buona partenza ha detto massa ero anche nel lato buono della pista sapevo che sarebbe stato difficile sorpassare hamilton e kovalainen dovevo rischiare alla frenata sono riuscito a prendere la scia di lewis lui andato allinterno a proteggersi e io ho provato tutto nella frenata sono riuscito a caricare la velocit sopra di lui ho fatto una bella manovra sapevo che la partenza era un momento unico per poter vincere
685732 una rivincita sono stato aggressivo tante volte nella mia carreira a hockenheim per non avevo armi per lottare la macchina non me lo permetteva hamilton mi avrebbe passato al giro dopo oggi invece avevo una grande macchina per lottare
685733 mi dispiace per felipe e per la squadra brutto perdere una gara in questo modo per me stata dura perch quando si sta a lungo dietro una vettura pi lenta diventa frustrante e noioso quando finalmente ho potuto spingere la macchina si comportava molto bene ma ormai era troppo tardi sono arrivato nella scia di glock ma allultimo ho dovuto rallentare perch c stato un problema meccanico sul retrotreno e la squadra mi ha detto di essere molto cauto per cercare di portare la macchina al traguardo vero sono quello che ha guadagnato pi punti fra i primi tre della classifica a dimostrazione che questo campionato davvero imprevedibile fatto di alti e bassi per tutti

685750 my wife and i were very early ebay employees and are now using our earnings from its success to make the world a healthier place as our way of giving back to society
685751 members of our organization are still talking about what a huge help go daddy was to us from the start
685752 one year go daddy jumped in to save the telethons online component the next year they helped to significantly increase our online contributions and this year they helped us reach our goal in donations
685753 when bill walsh learned that the chargers were willing to trade fred he came to me like a kid with his eye on the niftiest possible christmas present you see bill had something different in mind for fred something downright revolutionary
685754 wait until you see what we do with fred tomorrow
685755 in that wonderful manipulative way of his he put out the word that fred would be a nonfactor
685756 in fact he told john madden who was doing the game that fred wouldnt play much if at all oh did he play he sacked danny white three times and we won 45 14
685757 coach told me i might get 8 10 plays 12 if i was lucky
685758 he said he was worried about my conditioning and when he told me that i didnt think i was going to have to do that much that night but i ended up playing almost the whole game afterwards he told me my conditioning was just fine
685759 the week of preparation leading up to the chargers game i kept asking the linemen that had been there that previous year about dean
685760 id run the film back and forth and id say is fred dean really that fast or is this kind of a tape theyve got it going in a faster speed id say how can a guy that size be that fast and that strong
685761 im sure a lot of people were licking their chops before playing me because they thought i was so small
685762 fred is now considered one of the best one of the elite one of the all time greats
685763 he was our lawrence taylor i think what was great about what fred was able to do when he was with the 49ers was that he established our defense he made our defense i know i wouldnt have been able to wear this yellow jacket had it not been for having a person like fred dean in the game of football with the san francisco 49ers
685764 fred was very quiet but i always knew how funny he was
685765 he always had people laughing but i was nervous its like getting ready for a game you have those pre game jitters i was hoping and wishing he would speak like he played and he did that
685766 what i did i went off and left my glasses and i cant see my words
685767 thats the most ive ever heard him speak he was so eloquent and he it was right from his heart and it was so meaningful i was in tears
685768 i think what stuck out to me was the sincerity about the people who touched his life about bill walsh and how much it meant for him to come to the 49ers he said he was born in san diego but that he really came alive with us in san francisco and wow did he start something unbelievable for us because he was the final piece when he came to san francisco and he really became a dominant player for us on defense
685769 standing up here on this platform is much different than i imagined
685770 the reality of getting into the pro football hall of fame didnt really hit me till a few days ago and then to see the magnitude of all of this and all of you its been something amazing
685771 my dad provided my sister and me with a lot of great advice throughout the years
685772 like most kids we dont always follow that advice a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they are humans and they make mistakes too i guess i didnt listen to that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
685773 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
685774 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
685775 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a prize fight or other sporting events
685776 he taught me about honor commitment love religion hard work and respect
685777 it happens when youre protecting someone like john and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
685778 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
685779 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players jack lambert jack ham bobby bell and many others

685806 karena anda mengistimewakan diri anda dari kami masing masing kami hanya diberi sehelai baju tetapi untuk diri anda anda ambil dua helai
685807 sebagaimana tuan tuan ketahui saya ini bertubuh tinggi sedangkan kain bagian saya pendek maka abdullah pun memberikan kepada saya bagiannya dan oleh saya digunakan untuk menyambung bagian baju saya
685808 kau hanyalah sebuah batu yang tidak memberi mudharat atau manfaat demi allah seandainya saya tidak melihat rasulullah saw menciummu tidaklah saya menciummu
685809 apa gunanya berlari lari anjing dengan membuka kedua bahu ini padahal allah telah meneguhkan islam dan menyingkirkan kekafiran
685810 pada zaman rasullah dulu ada sekelompok kaum munafik yang rajin ibadah dalam hal ini mengejarakan sholat namun patut disayangkan bahwa setiap mereka sholat itu tidak diniatkan karena allah melainkan karena ingin dilihat oleh orang lain ketika ada orang yang melihat mereka sholat maka mereka akan sholat dengn khusuyunya tetapi jika tidak ada orang yang melihatnya maka mereka sholat dengan seenaknya bahkan mereka tidak mengerjakannya apa yang dikerjakan selalu ingin mendapatkan pujian dari orang lain atau dengan kata lain riya selain itu kaum munafik ini enggan untuk memeberikan barang barang berguna yang dimikinya kepda orang yang membutuhkannya dengan kata lain kaum munafik ini enggan untuk megeluarkan zakat allah tidak menyukai kaum seperti ini oleh karena itu allah menurunkan wahyu nya kepada nabi muhammad saw dengan perantara malaikat jibril sebagai ancaman kepada kaum munafik tersebut dan menggolongkan mereka kedalam orang orang yang mendustakan agama allah
685811 mengurus urusan mereka secara patut adalah baik dan jika kamu menggauli mereka maka mereka adalah saudara mu dan allah mengetahui siapa yang membuta kerusakan dari yang mengadakan perbaikan dan jika allah menghendaki niscaya dia dapat mendatangkan kesulitan kepadamu sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
685812 apa saja harta yang kamu nafkahkan hendaklah diberikan kepada ibu bapak kaum kerabat anak anak yatim orang orang miskin dan orang orang miskin dan orang orang yang sedang dalam perjalanan
685813 dan tidaklah mereka mengetahui bahwa allah melapangkan rizki dan menyempitkan bagi siapa yang yang dikehendaki nya sesungguhnya pada yang demikian itu terdapat tanda tanda kekuasaan allah bagi kaum yang beriman
685814 sesungguhnya zakat zakat itu hanyalah untuk orang orang fakir orang orang miskin pengurus pengurus zakat para muallaf yang dibujuk hatinya untuk memerdekan budak orang orang yang berhutang untuk jalan allah dan orang orang yang sedang dalam perjalanan sebagai suatu ketetapan yang diwajibkan allah dan allah maha mengetahui lagi maha bijaksana
685815 tidak ada tiga orangpun dalam suatu kampung atau gurun yang tidak didirikan shalat berjamaah diantara mereka itu kecuali mereka itu telah dipengaruhi oleh syaitan maka berjamaahlah kamu karena sesungguhnya serigala itu hanya memakan kambing yang terpencil dari kelompoknya
685816 sesungguhnya dua rakaat shalat ini merupakan shalat yang paling berat bagi orang munafik sekiranya kalian mengetahui keutamaan yang ada pada keduanya niscaya kalian akan menghadirinya sekalipun dengan merangkak dan sesungguhnya barisan pertama seperti barisan para malaikat dan sekiranya kalian mengetahui apa keutamaannya niscaya kalian segera mendatanginya dan sesungguhnya shalat seseorang bersama satu orang lebih baik dari shalatnya sendirian dan shalatnya bersama dua orang lebih baik dari shalatnya bersama satu orang dan semakin banyak maka semakin dicinta allah azza wajalla
685817 kami memandang bahwa orang yag tidak suka shalat berjamaah itu adalah orang munafik yang nyata kemunafikannya sungguh pernah terjadi seorang laki laki dipapah oleh dua orang sehingga orang itu dimasukkan ke dalam syaf
685818 nabi saw meminta izni masuk rumahku lalu akupun meminta izin beliau
685819 tempat manakah dari rumahmu yang engkau suka aku shalat di dalamnya
685820 shalat seseorang dengan berjamaah itu melebihi shalatnya di rumah atau di pasar sebanyak 25 kali lipat
685821 ya allah berilah orang ini rahmat ya allah belas kasihilah ia dan orang yang dianggap sedang bershalat semenjak ia mulai menantikannya diriwayatkan olah bukhari dan muslim
685822 sesungguhnya engkau bukanlah tuhan seperti katamu dan bebaskanlah rakyatmu dari perbudakan
685823 musa sungguh engkau tidak tahu membalas budi aku asuh dan aku didik engkau sampai besar sekarang inikah balasanmu
685824 sekarang ini allah tuhan semesta alam telah mengangkat aku menjadi salah seorang diantara utusan utusan nya
685825 memalukan pengecut kalian sungguh sungguh telah menghinaku apakah kalian berani beriman kepada tuahan musa dan harun tanpa izinku
685826 ayu cepat menyebrang perintah musa mereka pun berlarian sampai ke ujung jalan tetapi firaun juga mulai mendekati mereka kemudian musa diperintah allah untuk memukulkan tongkatnya lagi ke lautan dan jalan terbentang menjadi air laut kembali
685827 tidak dapat naik surga orang yang isi hatinya ada seberat zarrah dari sombong
685828 ada tiga macam manusia kelak di hari kiamat allah tidak akan mengampuni dosanya tidak akan merahmatinya bagi mereka disediakan siksa yang amat pedih yaitu 1 tua bangka yang berbuat zina 2 penguasa yang mendustakan rakyatnya dan 3 orang miskin yang sombong
685829 dan sesungguhnya hari kiamat itu pastilah datang tak ada keraguan padanya
685830 dan diangkatlah bumi dan gunung gunung lalu dibenturkan keduanya sekali pukul
685831 barangsiapa yang mengerjakan kebaikan seberat dzarrah pun niscaya dia akan melihat balasan nya dan barangsiapa yang mengerjakan kejahatan seberat dzarrah pun niscaya dia akan melihat balasan nya pula
685832 bersedekahlah kamu karena sedekah dapat membebaskan kamu dari api neraka
685833 barangsiapa yang diminta dengan ridho allah lalu dia memberi maka dituliskan baginya 70 kebaikan
685834 kaum hartawan dapat memperoleh harta yang lebih banyak mereka shalat seperti kami shalat mereka puasa seperti kami berpuasa dan dapat bersedekah dengan sisa harta mereka
685835 bukankah allah swt telah memberi berbagai macam cara untuk bersedekah setiap kalimat tasbih adalah sedekah setiap kalimat takbir adalah sedekah setiap kalimat tahmid adalah sedekah setiap kalimat tahlil adalah sedekah mengajak kepada kebaikan dan melarang kejahatan amar maruf dan nahi munkar adalah sedekah
685836 sesungguhnya allah berfirman kepadaku berinfaklah kamu maka aku akan berinfak kepadamu
685837 pemberian allah selalu cukup dan tidak pernah berkurang walaupun mengalir siang dan malam
685838 hai isa katakanlah kapada hambaku malum bahwa aku sudah mengampuni dosanya karena sedekah pedangnya itu dan karena dia senang kepadamu juga sampaikan kepada abid tersebut bahwa dia adalah kawanmu kelak di surga
685839 hai isa katakan kepada abid itu karena dia tidak rela atas keputusan ku dan menghina orang maka mulai saat ini kujadikan dia penghuni neraka kelak dan orang yang semula disebut malum orang yang sangat kikir kini menggantikan tempat si abid di surga kelak

685843 berbahagialah kamu kamu telah meminjamkan enam dirham kepada allah allah memberimu 300 dirham tiap satu dirham
685844 badui yang pertama menemuimu itu ialah jibril dan yang terakhir mikail
685845 sesungguhnya allah telah mendengar perkataan dan jawaban kaummu terhadapmu dan allah telah mengutus malaikat penjaga gunung untuk engkau perintahkan sesukamu
685846 wahai muhammad sesungguhnya allah telah mendengar perkataan kaummu terhadapmu jika engkau suka aku bisa membalikkan gunung akhsyabin di atas mereka
685847 bahkan aku menginginkan semoga allah berkenan mengeluarkan dari anak keturunan mereka yang menyembah allah semata tidak menyekutukan nya dengan sesuatu pun

685856 almaghreb such as carthage alqardajana modern tunisia the berber and the muslim civilizations following the lighting conquest of the area by the muslim armies led by the legendary muslim warrior amir ibna al as omar ibna al as the ruins of some of those history can be seen in libya tunisia algeria al jasayir and morocco these ancient civilizations left behind a huge body of knowledge impressive ruins and scholarship these treasure trophies were largely neglected by africans those ancient african histories can be well matched if not better than the much publicized and extensively written about european civilizations such as the roman byzantine and the hapsburg empires the phoenicians napoleon and others the difference between the later and the former is simple the later were well researched documented and written about while the former still lays as ruins all over the continent the european colonial powers portrayed africa as a place which has no written history and populated by sub human savages but the bulk of the blame of what had happened to such an illustrious history will go to people of the continent the heritage history and past glories of nations must be documented by its people that responsibility has eluded both the indigenous inhabitants of the continent and their diaspora this thought provoking question regarding as to what has happened to africas heroes is a persistent question all those concerned about the ills and aliments of africa often ask what they are trying to say is how come some body some where such as a traditional elder local leader religious personality or what have you can not come forward and intervene to stop the endless conflicts and dysfunction going on around the continent it crystal clear the post colonial regional and international organizations such as the au and united nations and their agencies have miserably failed tootless organizations that have outlived their usefulness can not and will not solve their problems these organizations failed miserably to resolve any major problem in the continent in some cases they exacerbate problems look closely when ever a challenge faces an african nation they call for a meeting in these gatherings they formulate empty press releases and immediately pass the problem to the united nations which is another failed bureaucracy the point here is africans need to resolve their own problems because there is nobody else out there who can revolve their conflicts the third question is by far the most painful and difficult question many africans want to digest dissect analyze and are eager to understand what had happened to the independence promise it is a concrete fact the african people gallantly and courageously ejected the recalcitrant colonial powers from their land those masses who gave their blood and treasure for the independence freedom and liberty of the continent never enjoyed the fruits of that huge sacrifice during the hasty departure from the continent the colonial powers have tricked the african masses by placing their friends in the highest positions of power at the expense of the general public these dark skinned selected leaders look dark but europeans in their thinking and mind set for the last 40 years the continent was misruled by an unholy alliance of european appointed african despots and their former colonial masters those african dictators were what the famed african revolutionary francis fannon called

686072 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
686073 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
686074 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
686075 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
686076 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names

686087 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true

686105 and do you really want to hold my dirty hands
686106 one of the most pernicious writers is steven plaut a man who could be thought of as israels daniel pipes
686107 this book is a historical study not a work of pure fiction nevertheless it will open with a number of stories rooted in a collective memory that has been adulterated with a considerable degree of imagination
686108 any mention of the khazars in the israeli public arena
686109 a source of consolation and hope for the scattered jewish communities of the diaspora during the middle ages the story of the khazar kingdom today has the ring of pure mythology nonetheless that story is one of the most wonderful chapters in jewish history
686110 the wave of decolonization of the 1950s and 1960s that led the molders of israeli collective memory to shield themselves from the shadow of the khazar past there was a profound fear that should the jews now rebuilding their home in israel learn that they are not direct descendants of the children of israel the very legitimacy of both the zionist enterprise and the state of israels existence would be undermined
686111 it is irrelevant whether the conversion to judaism encompassed a large stratum of the khazar nation what is important is that this event was regarded as a highly significant phenomenon in jewish history a phenomenon that has since totally disappeared judaism as a missionary religion the question of the long term impact of that chapter in jewish history on east european jewry whether through the development of its ethnic character or in some other way is a matter that requires further research nonetheless although we do not know the extent of its influence what is clear to us today is that this conversion did have an impact
686112 israels academic community developed a violent attitude toward this issue any mention of the khazars in the public arena in israel was increasingly considered eccentric a flight of fancy even an open threat
686113 tell me what your position is on the past and i will tell you the nature of your connection with the agencies of the regime
686114 was widespread in the jewish diaspora in the late second temple period many of the converts to judaism came from the gentile population of palestine but an even greater number of converts could be found in the jewish diaspora communities in both the east and the west
686115 the mass conversions that created such huge jewish populations throughout the mediterranean region are scarcely mentioned in jewish national historiography
686116 his continual attempts to prove that the jews were a race of people that had been displaced from its ancient homeland and which had been condemned to wander from country to country as an exiled nation dovetail beautifully with the directives of mainstream zionist historiography
686117 the jews must not be allowed to constitute a special political entity or to have a special political status instead each jew must on an individual basis be a citizen of france
686118 contains 41 letters from rabbis that relate to various aspects of jewish life
686119 was in fact the first official historian of the second temple period at the hebrew university of jerusalem
686120 he took me down in the first round and he dropped me a couple times
686121 last time i checked this was mma not a karate point match
686122 you know lyoto is a damn good fighter and i just couldnt impose my will on him im really impressed by his ability to avoid my takedowns and i look forward to seeing him fight again
686123 we got a second rush today big news from the capitol and everyone has to jaw about it
686124 thats why the soldiers are out the assassin is still on the loose the streets just arent safe
686125 look as soon as you can meet me in the gateroom
686126 ive gotta move cant stay in any place too long but i need to know that youll follow
686127 you know where the big ring is you can make it right
686128 a scandal of some sort involving some people who came through the ring the governments in a tizzy over it
686129 the streets arent safe not even for the soldiers talia every man in barracks 12 at the ershar reeducation center was killed yesterday and the head of the governors private guard was killed in a brawl two days ago five of his men with him
686130 dont you understand does the fact that you cant talk mean youre an idiot
686131 theres a madman out there killing people you could be next
686132 hes looking for something and hes not going to rest until he finds it
686133 i cant stay theyre on my tail if anything happens find the stargate dont worry about me ill find you
686134 he was supposed to get the old machines working but i guess something happened it all seems worse
686135 can you hurry it up im not sure how long i can last
686136 i just need you to reconnect the fitting and then we can try powering it up
686137 there was an announcement before you arrived right before the storm hit a government apologized for a case of mistaken identity they sent the wrong man for reeducation
686138 makes you wonder how many others there are doesnt it
686139 soldiers will come here soon asking me if i have seen you
686140 he escaped reeducation you did not you both came through the ring
686141 i dont know where you came from but the citys not a good place for you
686142 youll have good luck at the farms around here and no one asks a farmer to report his hired hands go quickly and dont let the soldiers find you
686143 before matches we examine our rivals and explain to our players what to do but from chivas we are waiting for a dvd that as of now saturday afternoon has not yet arrived thus we have little info for sunday
686144 but pep played in mexico and thus he knows how to play against such sides
686145 he says that they are one of mexicos stronger sides and a tough rival for us
686146 well go into the game with the idea that people will get minutes and gain the physical condition requred for the champions league
686147 hell need a new crown because that hat is hideous
686148 thats not going to go over well with the judges or his mom
686149 i continued doing the routine even though i had blood gushing out of my head
686150 and whats with the wise musical choice to not going with david hasselhoff here
686151 it think the judges should give him bonus points for not using any music by the hoff
686152 we have to share the pressure i have come to barcelona to enjoy football and the grandeur of this team i hope we can change the image of the last two years
686153 the players are spectacular it is very easy adapt to the people here and its good to have another brazilian here in sylvinho i identify well with him and also leo messi and i hope we can do a good job together
686154 i am thats why i came to bar a but there is no need to be anxious because there is not long before my debut and that wouldnt be good for me but im looking forward to that more than any other game i have to get ready so that people can enjoy what i do so we can achieve the targets fc barcelona have set
686155 we had a meeting with them on thursday but the difference between what they offer and what we ask is considerable
686156 we know that they have a lot of interest in the player and i imagine that this week theyll make a bid although i dont know if itll be on monday or later
686157 in any case i think itll be difficult for them to meet our asking price
686158 i knew this was going to be my last game at old trafford and today youve been absolutely fantastic again youre the best supporters in the world
686159 next id like to thank the manager hes been absolutely fantastic with me
686160 he has guided me through my career ive had my highs ive also had my lows and he supported me very well through that time
686161 i cant thank him enough im going into coaching and if i havent learnt from him than i cant do coaching so thank you boss
686162 the players ive played with the best players in the world its easy being a forward when you play with these players they create chances for you you miss one you get another one
686163 i cant say thanks enough to them theyve made every minute here a special one for me and the last 25 here ill remember for the rest of my life
686164 thanks to all the staff who have supported me who have helped me through dark periods most of all to the supporters youve been absolutely fantastic you kept me going
686165 the possibilities are better for the game against portsmouth than they were before
686166 i am happy because i saw players go up in their level from training the last game
686167 it was not the normal milan they had four of five players out big players with quality but our team played very well and the performance today was better than the four earlier games
686168 the game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
686169 today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games
686170 he was playing against a big club and to get four goals against milan for his confidence it is fantastic and anelka today and the last game played more inside the penalty area than before
686171 that is where i asked him to play and where i need him not right or left as before because we have one striker and that is anelka
686172 people dont judge you by your intentions they judge you by your behavior
686173 it was pretty much the same with the last record
686174 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
686175 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
686176 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
686177 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
686178 no the point is to emphasize that each of the case involved an actual human being
686179 putting aside the question of whether zero is impossible the most motivational target is zero if you say that we are trying to reduce say infections by 20 percent per year people will feel satisfied if they meet that target the idea is to establish creative tension for the organization by adopting an audacious goal and by the way in certain areas other hospitals have shown that zero is attainable for extended periods of time for certain types of error avoidance
686180 hes been doing this a lot longer than me and doesnt have respect for my skills i just wanna go out there and see if i can cave his head in
686181 it goes back to when i first got in the marine corps preparing to go to combat i thought it would be a great sport to get involved in to deal with the anxiety we do similar things in the marines as far as sparring and grappling just to keep that warrior mindset
686182 my first couple of fights i was a little surprised i was just looking to have fun and here i am
686183 i had to train in the morning and late at night there were no facilities no world class training partners so there were a lot of things i had to make up for
686184 ill watch fights and ill visualize my fights and ive never thought im going to knock this guy out its just one of those things that happens
686185 i wouldnt let anybody play me im not special no different from anybody else im a marine a husband and a father good question though but thats just my honest opinion
686186 to all the troops that are out there god bless them thank you so much theyre my inspiration every day i know what theyre going through and i know how tough it is and its absolutely inspirational what they do and there are certainly people out there that appreciate what they do
686187 i consider roger at the top of the weight class
686188 hes been tearing through competitors and popularity wise were at the top in my opinion it was the best fight you could put together in this weight class im in the ufc to fight the best and i consider roger one of the best
686189 i respect kenny and i think hes one of the best competitors there is
686190 hes one of those guys you have to bring your a game for
686191 its the best feeling in the world knowing you can go 100 miles an hour and not feel down and your opponent will eventually slow down its amazing for me its one of my best assets
686192 st pierre is a superior athlete going against a guy like that day in and day out is interesting because its grueling youve gotta be on top of your game with that guy
686193 ive been doing this for about 13 years now its just another day at the office for me
686194 you get sparring partners with equal skill or as close to that as you can you just hammer it out and go to work
686195 its a great opportunity to showcase my skills and my abilities
686196 i got a little more relaxed and polished as a fighter
686197 ive had a few months to train if the brock lesnar now was to fight the brock lesnar then id beat him im just trying to evolve as a fighter
686198 i didnt want any easy fights and heath is not an easy fight for me coming to the ufc was about wanting to be a fighter and be part of this organization and try to be a heavyweight contender
686199 i plan on being around for a while so i hope everybody enjoys watching my fights theres always pressure to win in any circumstance as an athlete nobody likes to follow a loser i wouldnt say my backs against the wall but i put pressure on me with everything i do
686200 i think because of the way i came up through the ufc a lot of people didnt see my fights
686201 people develop an attachment when they see you fight live a lot of fans still dont know who i am and they havent developed that kind of attachment or appreciation for me its not their fault i had a stacked weight division and i just kinda slipped through the cracks
686202 i think confidence is a key factor if you dont have it youll always be a failure i struggled early at purdue because i lacked confidence now i put myself mentally on the same plain as my opponents im just as much of an athlete or a man as anybody else im facing
686203 wrestling opens up the standup a lot more if people are worried about getting taken down its easier to hit them
686204 i train with some of the best in mma like nate marquardt patrick cote rashad evans and others
686205 i have so many good training partners and trainers i truly believe i train harder than others and i dont cut corners
686206 if youre happy and you know it clap your hands

686220 right now theres no rush at all to any jurisdiction including massachusetts
686221 other than the argument that the word marriage would make a difference in everyday recognition
686222 i am offended as a gay person and i am appalled as an american that somebody can commit a crime and not be held accountable and the people who are supposed to uphold that law are dismissing it
686223 its kind of hard to see how a civil union would be covered by the bigamy law but i have not done extensive research on this
686224 a person having a husband or wife living who marries another person
686225 youre getting into some novel legal issues with basically some real gray areas
686226 in my view it is bigamy but i would also say in my view given the state of flux and lack of clarity in the laws right now it would be a bad idea to prosecute it criminally

686232 ch vez quiere reformar la constituci n con la habilitante
686233 fuimos sorprendidos en una madrugada cualquiera en estos d as con una hilera de leyes 26 leyes en una madrugada entre cantos de gallos a media noche leyes que nadie conoce que ning n venezolano supo que se estaban horneando sab amos que se hab a otorgado nuevamente al ejecutivo nacional una facultada para otorgar leyes especiales esta caracter stica que hemos venido observando se parece mucho a aquella cosa de la ii guerra mundial cuando hitler entr en el poder el parlamento alem n le otorgo a hitler la facultad para otorgar leyes especiales el parlamento desapareci
686234 en esta oportunidad 26 l casi cesa de facultades el casi cesa se quedan all y dejan al ejecutivo de facultar con estas leyes
686235 son titulares de leyes para rellenarlas en el futuro porque ya se les venci el plazo
686236 muchas de las materias que el pueblo venezolano rechaz el 2 de diciembre cuando el presidente nos trat de sorprender con esa nueva constituci n con una serie de proposiciones destinadas a desarticularizar el pa s a deformar la instituci n democr tica y conformarla mediante un nuevo aparataje que llegaba mucho mas all de la simple formulaci n de proposici n legales sino que transformaba incluso la geograf a del pa s cuando l supo que el pueblo de venezuela las repudiaba busc el camino fabulesco para mecerlas como leyes habilitantes
686237 arbitrariamente por su cuenta violando el derecho que se le hab an dado l le agreg el 2 de diciembre la reserva nacional pues bien el presidente no estuvo conforme con la situaci n de imponernos un nuevo cuerpo en las fa y modifica el art culo 328 ha llegado al punto de reformar la constituci n por medio de habilitantes
686238 las pretensiones del presidente el 2 de diciembre fueron paradas se le present el gran frente de todos los venezolanos que le abri los ojos al pa s produjo el entusiasmo para saber que si pod amos que si era posible sacar de miraflores un nuevo intente de autoritarismo
686239 please be more precise in your practice of medicine than you are in your blogging
686240 i think this is evolution before our very eyes the only reason i could think of that one fears this
686241 hi i think blogging can be a great marketing tool for raising a physicians profile and
686242 sometimes even stories written by those in the field are not always accurate as the recent article in slate has
686243 let me explain the problem science has with jesus christ
686244 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help them would you try
686245 why not say that you would help a sick and maimed person if you could in fact most of us would if we could god doesnt
686246 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
686247 in philosophy you have to go easy with the new ones
686248 i think were going to have a lot of fun this semester ladies and gentlemen
686249 how is it that this god is good if he created all evil throughout all time
686250 all the hatred the brutality all the pain all the torture all the death and ugliness and all the suffering created by this good god is all over the world isnt it young man
686251 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
686252 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus in fact do you have any sensory perception of your god whatsoever
686253 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son where is your god now
686254 ah yet another christian in the vanguard come come young man speak some proper wisdom to the gathering
686255 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold
686256 thats a dumb question son what is night if it isnt darkness what are you getting at
686257 so you say there is such a thing as darkness
686258 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker and give me a jar of it can you give me a jar of darker darkness professor
686259 would you mind telling us what your point is young man
686260 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must be in error
686261 that for example there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cannot even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood them to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life merely the absence of it
686262 here is one of the most disgusting tabloids this country hosts professor is there such a thing as immorality
686263 wrong again sir you see immorality is merely the absence of morality is there such thing as injustice no injustice is the absence of justice is there such a thing as evil
686264 if there is evil in the world professor and we all agree there is then god if he exists must be accomplishing a work through the agency of evil 1 what is that work god is accomplishing the bible tells us it is to see if each one of us will of our own free will choose good over evil
686265 as a philosophical scientist i dont view this matter as having anything to do with any choice as a realist i absolutely do not recognize the concept of god or any other theological factor as being part of the world equation because god is not observable
686266 i would have thought that the absence of gods moral code in this world is probably one of the most observable phenomena going newspapers make billions of dollars reporting it every week tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
686267 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
686268 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
686269 ill overlook your impudence in the light of our philosophical discussion now have you quite finished
686270 so you dont accept gods moral code to do what is righteous
686271 sir you rightly state that science is the study of observed phenomena science too is a premise which is flawed
686272 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student may i give you an example of what i mean
686273 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors mind
686274 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors mind felt the professors mind touched or smelt the professors mind no one appears to have done so

686612 i think our car was actually a fair bit better than the time that we did
686613 the second set of tyres that we put on at the end there didnt grip up as much as we expected
686614 i think the car is a lot better and certainly it was fantastic straight out of the truck

686617 its a massive longshot and really its not something that im thinking about at all because for it to actually take place a fair bit has to happen i think i have to win all the races and the other guys have to basically score nothing so thats not likely to happen
686618 but if i do my very best hopefully that will get us to where we need to be by phillip island
686619 id rather be fighting for the championship but its a good position to watch from
686620 our goal is to go out and try to stay on top and win the round and if we can do that weve still got a lot to achieve for the rest of the year but its going to be interesting to watch the four guys fight it out
686621 the cars obviously pretty strong and it was a reasonably good lap but you only have to make one mistake and its a tenth of a second here which could be four positions
686622 but i think theres a bit left in it for tomorrow

686654 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
686655 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles

686676 sienna and balthazar were in new york for a few days together and then he told her he was going to la to work and see his kids but the reality is he is desperately trying to get back with his wife
686677 he realises hes made a terrible mistake he is trying to keep sienna at arms length and hasnt told her it is over yet so she is going frantic
686678 she has been calling and texting him constantly and is planning to go to la herself as she believes she can win him back if they have a face to face meeting shes devastated that he has distanced himself from her both emotionally and geographically

686680 as soon as balthy arrived back in la on monday he started pleading with his wife to take him back he told me hed gone to their house but she wouldnt let him in he stood outside crying
686681 he came back to a hotel and was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling and she finally agreed to let him back in the house
686682 in his mind he has definitely dropped sienna but hes in a very confused state at the moment his biggest fear is losing his kids

686692 it is perfectly possible for people to walk into this church worship with hundreds of others drink coffee and then leave without having spoken to a soul our challenge is to ensure that we are a community of connection god is giving us amazing chances to relate to people who have never been to church and we must seek creative ways to honour this blessing

686700 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
686701 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
686702 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
686703 i can barely feed myself so what do i care

686710 when we first started we met a lot of naysayers they would say hey the hungry ghost month we grew up with it it happens every year dont romanticise it people just burn stuff thats all you need to know when i went to deeper research and met the people who are active participants and devotees of this festival there was so much out there and this is what i want to share with singaporeans
686711 youre going to see not only getai song performances on a public stage and street opera youre going to see the invitation of the spirits youre going to see rare rituals and youre going to get inside to the underlying aspects of why these people practise seventh month rituals
686712 we knew that the key to capturing this madness or the craze was really to follow the celebrity teacher li yang around because he lectures to thousands of people across china all the research that we did didnt quite prepare us for the fact that when we turned up in hunan there were literally almost literally thousands of people and thundering applause as he came in to address them in an outdoor stadium it was really like capturing a rock concert
686713 anyone who spoke english any chinese person obviously during the years of the cultural revolution was found to be too western too decadent and some of them were actually persecuted for speaking the language there were many people who had to listen to the bbc who had to listen to the voice of america on the sly without being caught
686714 its not a film to mock the chinese its a film to acknowledge the efforts which theyve put in to acquiring whats a very difficult second language for them
686715 produzimos um jogo de basquete para a fiat a demanda surgiu quando a empresa entrou em contato com a gente solicitando um jogo para ser utilizado em din micas de grupos

686717 we have a paramilitary post which has been there for several years
686718 prasart ta muen thom belongs to us we have to have soldiers to take care of the area which belongs to us
686719 ta muen is in our territory but since 1998 thailand took a chance to occupy it by claiming that they came to conserve it
686720 hope has two children anger and courage anger at the way things are and courage to change them st augustine
686721 we dont know what we dont know and the object is to cut down on that
686722 by assuming that everyones a suspect and then you weed out the innocent
686723 its necessary to put in place regulations that will allow the fbi to transform itself into an intelligence gathering organization in addition to just a crime solving organization
686724 any review and change to the guidelines will reflect our traditional concerns for civil liberties and first amendment liberties and our traditional investigative emphasis on using the least intrusive means feasible
686725 in such a way as to avoid needless intrusions into the privacy of innocent citizens
686726 if he was treated that way because of his ethnicity that will make me madder than heck
686727 but its a very fine line to be drawn when the basis of the investigation is dominated by the ethnic background of the subject
686728 and when the investigation results in harassment you have a serious constitutional concern
686729 profiling has sent us in the wrong direction i thought we learned our lesson in that regard
686730 sa lalong madaling panahon alinsunod sa kagustuhan ni pangulong arroyo
686731 nagulat na lang kami ni wala man lang konsultasyon sa amin
686732 dahil prime lot o magandang paglagyan ng mga gusali at establisimyento ang lugar na kinatitirikan ngayon ng da gustong ipagbili ito ng gobyerno kahit pa na nangangahulugan ito nang malawakang tanggalan sa trabaho
686733 isasakripisyo nila ang trabaho at kapanakan ng mga empleyado maging ng mga mamamayang pinaglilingkuran ng mga ahensiyang apektado ng paglilipat para mapagbigyan ang mga kapitalistang gaya nina jaime zobel de ayala henry sy sr magkapatid na andrew at lucio tan at maging si john gokongwei jr
686734 sa halip naniniwala kami na mas magagastusan pa nga ang gobyerno dahil kailangang magtayo ng bagong mga gusali para sa mga tanggapan at ilipat ang lahat ng mga kagamitan
686735 kapag nasa isabela na ang da magkano ang pamasaheng kailangan namin mas malaki pa ata kaysa sa isang buwang sweldo

686737 kung nasaan ang inahin tiyak doon din ilalagay ang mga inakay di ba hindi naman puwedeng nandoroon sila da central office sa isabela at nandirito naman kami sa qc
686738 maganda kung sa maganda yung qc cbd pero para sa aming mga empleyado malawakang layoff ang mangyayari at mayayaman lang talaga ang makikinabang diyan sa proyekto paano ang mahihirap na cant afford pumunta sa qc para mag shopping
686739 alam naman natin na sa usapin ng pagbibili ng mga pag aari ng gobyerno naririyan ang mga padulas o mga lagayan para mapadali ang mga transaksiyon hindi lamang inaalisan ng gobyerno ng karapatan ang publiko sa mahahalagang serbisyo dahil sa paglipat ng mga tanggapan nito at ng trabaho ang mga empleyado sa loob ng mga opisinang ito nanakawan pa nila ang taumbayan

686882 while a schedule for computing fiduciary and attorney fees was set forth in
686883 e gregious error is committed when a court awards commissions and fees simply on a percentage basis without inquiry into the reasonableness of the compensation
686884 on this record therefore the payment of 45 000 in attorney fees was unreasonable it will therefore be reduced by half to 22 500 the executrix will therefore be surcharged in the amount of 22 500 for that excessive payment and her claimed commission of 34 000 will likewise be reduced by half to 17 000 consequently the surcharge that she must return to the estate is 39 500 a crucial factual consideration in reducing these fees and surcharging the executrix is that the beneficiaries whose interests were neglected were charities

686895 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe hard and it worked i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
686896 congratulations to heikki for his first and very well deserved grand prix win the race could have been better for me my start was okay but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me

686909 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here unfortunately the race was frustrating i made it tough for myself with a poor start which dropped me down to p14 after the first couple of corners i got boxed in at turn 1 and had a lot of wheelspin out of the corner which allowed a few people to get past on the outside i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
686910 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me we decided to start with used front and new rear tyres which proved to be a problem as the car was out of balance for the first stint then at my first pitstop we were unlucky to have the problem with the rig which resulted in a small fire and a long delay whilst we got fuel into the car using the second rig after that my race was effectively over as the number of blue flags made it impossible to make progress we decided to drop the revs on the engine and do some testing with the tyres as we had overheating problems over the weekend and it was good to collect some data on this for me the actual race was one to forget really
686911 todays race was never going to be easy from our grid positions from the first lap both drivers were held up by heidfeld who was running on a different strategy and this prevented them from using their true pace the new developments that we brought to hungary have definitely helped us to improve the performance of the car as is always the case though the rest of the field isnt standing still and we do not yet have the pace to score points on our own merit

686915 what an incredible feeling i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 to get such a good result in my first year is fantastic so a huge thank you to all the team including the engineers mechanics and everyone at the factory i knew from qualifying that we had good speed and weve looked strong all weekend today i made a good start and gained a place into the first corner i had a really good car and everything went perfectly until the last stint on the soft tyres i was struggling a lot and soon i had kimi behind me but i knew from last year here in gp2 when i was stuck in the midfield in a really good car how hard it is to pass here so when i saw him in the mirrors i knew i couldnt afford any mistakes this result more than makes up for hockenheim and now we must keep picking up regular points until the end of the season
686916 this is a very good result for us and to pick up ten points is great for the constructors championship im glad for timo because he has had a very good weekend and fully deserves this result this could have been better for me too despite my problems in qualifying i was quick today but i couldnt push because i only had one lap that was clear of traffic in the whole afternoon i gained one position early on but overtaking is practically impossible here around the second stops i was also stuck behind lewis holding me up further still im delighted that we are showing such strong form and i just hope we can carry on in good shape and with such good results

686976 it wont be perfect this first pre season game but we have several to get up to speed
686977 the pre season games you dont put a lot of stock in
686978 we want to get the offence going and make everyone comfortable and we want to get the defence established
686979 theyre going to be thrust into a brand new situation and even the veteran players here they dont know what im going to expect on the sidelines
686980 i think its an effective tool having that ability to get the call in in real time
686981 it alleviates some of the time it takes to get a call but they do turn it off 15 seconds before the play clock expires
686982 it is an extra pre season game its probably not the first thing we would choose
686983 im very happy ive won my first title its always tough to play two matches on the same day but vera had to do it as well
686984 at the start i had her under pressure and i think that frustrated her she played better in the second set and began putting pressure on me instead she had break points at 2 all there and i think getting out of that was the key to the match
686985 the sunday negotiations did unfortunately not produce apositive outcome and the deadlock therefore remains
686986 the current stayaway will continue as planned meaningthat cwu and sacu members will not report for work on monday
686987 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
686988 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability
686989 and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
686990 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues
686991 but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period
686992 what senator obama has said is that he is committed to restoring sound long term fiscal conditions
686993 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare
686994 were not going to sell strategic projects but we dontrule out sharing some projects with partners
686995 we called their help line and got a wonderful young man in the philippines who told us
686996 we cant install it because your name has in it
686997 and the first person said thats outrageous and put me on to a second person who said hed never heard of such a thing
686998 if i cant use my own name im going to stay with my at amp t dial up
686999 is for these people at least to stand at attention to explain themselves i dont know if youve ever tried to get to verizon you cannot get to them they are insulated from things like this
687000 actually im kind of surprised if this is dr libshitzs name your name is your identity hes had this his entire life i think he needs a little bit of personal attention
687001 as a general rule since 2005 verizon doesnt allow questionable language in e mail addresses but we can and do make exceptions based on reasonable requests the one from dr and mrs libshitz certainly is reasonable and we regret the inconvenience and frustration theyve been caused
687002 these people have no trouble putting me in their phone book they send me mail with that name they send me a bill routinely and they cash my checks with libshitz on it they just offended me

687100 written on backs of brown paper bags or of discarded bills programs and invitations on tiny scraps of stationery pinned together on leaves torn from old notebooks on mildewed subscription blanks or on drug store bargain flyers there are pink scraps blue and yellow scraps one of them a wrapper of chocolat meunier
687101 in its visionary minimalism the white box with its central blue window sums up a whole cluster of themes that cornell associated with dickinson birds and prisons the transitory rooms of hotels and decrepit mansions the starlit sky and the escape and the refuge provided by the voyaging imagination toward a blue peninsula is at once a deeply personal response to the dickinson experience as well as the single most trenchant interpretive response in all of american art to the meaning of her life and work

687104 americans during and after the civil war gradually left behind a static view of existence a trust in fixed arrangements and hierarchies in science and in art in religion and in love they came to see a new dynamism and movement in their lives a brave new world of instability and evanescence this dynamism in all aspects of life found perfect expression in the hummingbird

687131 paramount home entertainment japan has announced that they will bring indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull to blu ray by the end of this year day and date with the dvd release a few days ago the us dvd release was announced with no mention of a us blu ray while a japanese blu ray release doesnt guarantee a us blu ray release or a release anywhere else in the world hopefully information will materialize soon

687135 real school meaning innaprpriate curriculum based on prior experiences students havent had taught as if every student is an 8 year old girl and tested to make sure it measures what students dont know and what the teacher didnt teach
687136 at least theyre aware that weve entered the early innings of what could easily become a very disruptive period of our history
687137 most of them are responding constructively rather than just defensively theyre much more interested in gardening and animal husbandry than firearms
687138 the gun nuts have been on the scene longer than the peak oil argument has been in play
687139 they were initially preoccupied with big government and its accompanying narrative fantasy of fascist oppression which is why they adopted a fascist tone themselves but peak oil survivalists are different from the ruby ridge generation they dont think that a bolt hole in the woods is a very promising strategy we have no idea at this point what the level of social cohesion or disorder may be but if the rural areas especially the agricultural centers become too lawless for farming then well be in pretty severe trouble because there will be nothing for us to eat
687140 there is greater interest in preparedness these days because the fragility of our economy lengthening chains of supply and the complexity of the technological infrastructure have become apparent to a broader cross section of the populace
687141 all parties concerned may not realize it but the left of center greens calling for local economies and encouraging farmers markets have a tremendous amount in common with john birchers decrying globalist bankers and gun owners complaining about their constitutional rights
687142 id say that survivalism is indeed a celebration of community
687143 it is the embodiment of americas traditional can do spirit of self reliance that settled the frontier
687144 it seems a natural human impulse that we are hard wired to follow as circumstances require
687145 although it is constrained by social and cultural conditioning to some degree in our consumer culture survivalism is related to the gear fetishism you see in popular magazines that purport to be about sporting adventures but are really about acquiring snazzy equipment america in 2008 has become a cartoon culture of hollywood violence that promotes grandiose power fantasies of hyper individualism and vigilante justice add guns and economic hardship and spice it up with ethnic grievances and the recipe is not very appetizing
687146 if anything life in the 22nd century will more closely resemble the 19th century than the 20th century sadly the 21st century will probably be remembered as the time of the great die off
687147 its a very big change but people are resilient and resourceful
687148 we will witness the formation of some remarkable intentional communities that will feature some unlikely bedfellows anarchists and ayn rand readers mennonites and gun enthusiasts luddites and techno geeks fundamentalist christians and gaia worshippers tree huggers and horse wranglers
687149 theres going to be things that happen when people cant get things that they need for themselves and their families
687150 i decided there was nothing like getting the training myself to deal with insurrections if thats a possibility
687151 i remember the oil crisis in 73 i remember waiting in line for gas
687152 if there is a disruption in the oil supply it will be very quickly elevated into a disaster
687153 assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilised infrastructure
687154 the four horsemen of the apocalypse ride out every two generations and they come in different disguises
687155 we are due to see the horsemen again some time in the next 10 to 20 years and the prudent person with wealth should take out an insurance policy against them
687156 imagine if the next outage lasted for four or five days there would be a mass exodus from cities
687157 self sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food
687158 well stocked with seed fertiliser canned food medicine clothes etc
687159 that if you can afford it you should invest in a bolthole a farm perhaps where you could live for a month and survive
687160 you should have food water medicine clothes and possibly ak47s to fire over the heads of any guys depending on how bad things become
687161 given the kind of crises i am talking about a month should be enough for people and systems to recover
687162 the systems we rely on are brittle and facing strain
687163 here in seattle we are vulnerable to earthquakes and i also live near a big volcano climate change is causing more extreme weather events there could be a global bird flu outbreak or some other pandemic
687164 there is the problem of peak oil peak gas peak food peak corn peak everything
687165 whats interesting about the new survivalism is that its focus is everything
687166 unlike previous alarmist responses to a crisis which focused on one main threat for example nuclear war todays survivalism is driven by an unbounded imagination of anxiety
687167 the new survivalism can also be seen as a highly ritualised affectation
687168 through self imposed restraint and expressions of concern for the future of humanity the individual sends out signals about his own responsible behaviour
687169 the affectation of survivalism is one of the most interesting features of our culture of fear today
687170 assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilized infrastructure
687171 your safe haven must be self sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food
687172 it should be well stocked with seed fertilizer canned food wine medicine clothes etc think swiss family robinson even in america and europe there could be moments of riot and rebellion when law and order temporarily completely breaks down
687173 im not a gun nut camo wearing skinhead i dont even hunt or fish
687174 if all these planets line up and things do get really bad
687175 those who have not prepared will be trapped in the city with thousands of other people needing food and propane and everything else
687176 you just cant help wonder if theres a train wreck coming
687177 but in recent months ive noticed an increasing number of stridently green and left of center readers
687178 the where do we land when climate change gets crazy question seems to be an increasingly common one
687179 its all the same ball of wax as far as im concerned

687194 lo que trata la radio es hacer conciencia en el pueblo ecuatoriano que se interese en un tema de trascendencia en el pa s un tema que nos va a involucrar a todos que nos influenciar a todos
687195 el inter s nuestro es que se conozca los temas cruciales de la constituyente para ir con conocimientos de causa a votar que se conozca que es lo que implica una cosa y que es lo que implica otra por esos motivos tendremos diferentes invitados analizando los puntos de vista de apoyo tanto al s como al no
687196 si bien no dice por ning n lado la palabra aborto pero deja la puerta abierta para que se den para atender ciertas necesidades de la mujer la violada por ejemplo se debe atender desde la concepci n eso no se puede permitir en el ecuador esta constituci n deja la puerta abierta para el aborto
687197 que sea una constituci n abortista eso es falso y otra cosa que la interpretaci n de un abogado permita ciertos tipos de aborto como el terap utico como permite eso no podemos decir que es abortista eso es falso
687198 es un canto a la vida porque primero en el art culo 45 hay lecturas dispersas quisiera dejar claro a la personas que la constituci n en ninguna parte habla de aborto por lo tanto no es una constituci n abortista
687199 el mandamiento de no matar s es aplicable en toda circunstancia
687200 no hay diversos tipos de familia eso fue un pedido de los grupos gays de lesbianas transexuales y bisexuales eso la iglesia lo rechaza si ellos quer an que se proteja su patrimonio tiene opciones jur dicas pero porque ponerlo en la constituci n y eso la iglesia lo rechaza
687201 s hay diversos tipos de familia con esto de la migraci n nuestro pueblo ha sufrido muchos cambios tenemos abuelos encargados de los ni os t as de sus sobrinos y quien en estos momentos no ha visto una madre soltera era importante hablar de la variedad de familia
687202 se limita solo a relaciones de patrimonio que construyen entre ellos fruto de esa relaci n entre personas del mismo sexos tienen todo el derecho pero para el tema de familia no lo podemos satanizar no va hacia all el tema
687203 esta constituci n no dar m s empleo la canasta b sica hace dos a os estaba en 200 d lares hoy est casi en 600 todo se pondr m s caro la corrupci n seguir la delincuencia ser peor se legalizar el consumote drogas no se garantiz la vida desde la concepci n queremos un cambio s pero no con esta constituci n no se deje enga ar y vote no

687205 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
687206 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
687207 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
687208 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
687209 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
687210 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
687211 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
687212 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
687213 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
687214 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
687215 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
687216 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
687217 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
687218 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
687219 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
687220 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
687221 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
687222 new book out and making the move to open access
687223 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
687224 were not gonna allow racism to come into this campaign in any form
687225 and so im gonna respond if it comes up again
687226 is he ready to lead or as ready as john mccain the answer is no
687227 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to

687230 all ms bristow had to do was cooperate so she could face the charges against her instead she chose to stall and make it very difficult for us to work with her because the charges she faces conflicted with her planned vacation
687231 when we finally asked her to turn herself in as soon as she returned from vacation she was still uncooperative and couldnt commit to doing so over her concern that she would have jet lag

687272 the bbfc should realise there are scenes of gratuitous violence in the dark knight to which i would certainly not take my 11 year old daughter

687276 the real problem is that in previous batman films jack nicholsons joker was jokier

687295 nanti dalam pesta pernikahanku undanganku dan undangan bang ronald kan banyak yang bukan orang batak padahal kita tidak menyediakan hari yang khusus buat mereka selama ini saya lihat kalau undangan batak sudah datang yang non batak udah dicuekin kasihan mereka padahal mereka juga ingin tau prosesi adat pernikahan batak

687329 now carl what would you do with an 18 year old belgium girl
687330 apenas somos conscientes de la extraordinaria singularidad de nuestra propia postura de modo que nos resulta muy dif cil de admitir el hecho evidente de que haya existido un consenso filos fico nico de amplitud universal que ha sido sostenido por muchos hombres y mujeres que han compartido las mismas experiencias y han transmitido esencialmente la mismas ense anzas hoy o hace seis mil a os y desde nuevo m xico en el lejano oeste hasta jap n en el lejano oriente
687331 en la misma esencia de tu ser no percibes la verdad pero en realidad est ah
687332 vivo pero no soy yo sino cristo quien vive en mi
687333 no puedo percibir mi verdadera identidad mi uni n con el esp ritu porque mi conciencia est obnubilada y obstruida por alguna actividad aunque recibe muchos nombres diferentes es simplemente la actividad de contraer y centrar la conciencia en mi yo individual en mi ego personal mi conciencia no se halla abierta relajada y centrada en dios sino cerrada contra da y centrada en m mismo y es precisamente la identificaci n con esa contracci n en mi mismo y la consiguiente exclusi n de todo lo dem s lo que me impide encontrar o descubrir mi identidad anterior mi verdadera identidad con el todo
687334 he aqu la verdad resumida todo pecado toda muerte toda condenaci n y todo infierno no son sino el reino del yo del ego las diversas actividades del narcisismo del amor propio y del ego smo que separan el alma de dios y abocan a la muerte y al infierno eterno
687335 no hay infierno sino individualidad no hay para so sino altruismo
687336 lo nico que arde en el infierno es el ego
687337 hay dos caminos uno de ellos consiste en expandir tu ego hasta el infinito y el segundo en reducirlo a la nada
687338 yo no soy nada oh dios t lo eres todo
687339 dios se hizo hombre para que el hombre pudiera hacerse dios
687340 una transformaci n completa en la misma esencia de la conciencia
687341 en esta transformaci n he descubierto que dios y yo somos lo mismo
687342 solo cuando nuestro ego muere comprendemos finalmente que no hay nada con lo que podamos identificarnos y entonces podemos transformarnos realmente en lo que ya somos
687343 la vida es un juego de probabilidades terribles si fuera una apuesta no intervendr as en ella

687353 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
687354 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
687355 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
687356 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
687357 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign
687358 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
687359 i believe he is much better now than he was then
687360 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
687361 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
687362 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
687363 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
687364 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
687365 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
687366 i tell them to first explain about the disease how its transmitted how it cant be transmitted what it is
687367 and then they should tell them with confidence that they have it if they want
687368 i was living in a tent and i dont have that much money in prison at least my children have something to eat
687369 but when a mother is in prison for the murder of the father the lives of these children outside im not sure its a good alternative either
687370 if i let my daughter go to live with her uncle he may sell her to someone i will never let him sell her
687371 to whom can i send the children if they go outside
687372 im worried about them having to spend five more years here while they are sick
687373 i try to push her but she cant even stand on her own feet
687374 there is no open place for them to play there is no park they are living with their mothers inside the prison in the room
687375 if a child is breastfeeding it is necessary to be with the mother but there are some children who are 10 11 13
687376 if i go outside i can help my sister cook and wash the clothes i can study go to the mosque study the quran and when i come home i can help my sister wash the dishes
687377 i cant let my children be taken to an orphanage because i have many enemies who may kidnap them
687378 some of my enemies are even in prison and they ask about me if my children were in an orphanage i would not feel that they were safe
687379 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
687380 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
687381 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
687382 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
687383 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
687384 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
687385 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
687386 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
687387 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
687388 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
687389 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
687390 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
687391 he calls himself jimmy justice a self styled cop arazzi armed only with a video camera as he prowls the streets of new york looking for law enforcement officers who are breaking the law
687392 sometimes it gets ugly out there in the two years since he began making his videos jimmy said he has been threatened punched and spit on and has had video 0 46 he said he does not disclose his real name because he fears retaliation by someone whom he has made an unwilling youtube star and jimmy admits that he occasionally crosses the line sometimes verbally berating traffic enforcers
687393 whats with this need to track down people and be rude
687394 but it also guarantees the right of all paraguayans to have access to a piece of land
687395 there is a pent up demand in paraguay that has been barely satisfied
687396 im concerned there may be a little wishful thinking as to how easily it can be done
687397 if a month passes or a month and a half or two months
687398 200 undangan yang beredar saat pesta amplop yang masuk 98 dari 98 lembar itu sebanyak 21 kosong
687399 its the first time since ive been able to vote that i feel i have a candidate to vote for not against
687400 an expert may have gone but he has left behind thanks be to god experts whom he trained during years of giving patience and forbearance for the sake of right
687401 if you wish to travel far and fast travel light take off all your envies jealousies unforgiveness selfishness and fears
687402 if we increase our support at this crucial moment and help the iraqis break the current cycle of violence we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home
687403 america will hold the iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced
687404 to give every iraqi citizen a stake in the countrys economy iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all iraqis
687405 the complicated new law on has been in the words of a senior iraqi official perhaps worse than if we had done nothing
687406 loyalty that can be purchased is by its very nature fickle
687407 only months ago members of the awakening were planting ieds and ambushing u s soldiers they were snipers and assassins singing songs in honor of fallujah and fighting what they viewed as a war of national liberation against the foreign occupiers there is little doubt what will happen when the massive influx of american money stops unless the new iraqi state continues to operate as a vast bribing machine the insurgent sunnis who have joined the new militias will likely revert to fighting the ruling shiites who still refuse to share power
687408 we are paying them concerned local citizens groups not to blow us up
687409 the surge is working i know some dont want to admit that and i understand
687410 i want you to look at iraq now and listen to those who say the security situation is better ideal no but better
687411 t he refusal of the candidates to acknowledge the indisputable military progress of the past year is
687412 its also true that u s troop deaths have been declining steadily since the spring and in fact in the month of october they were at their lowest level in nearly two years at the same time there has been a marked decline in the number of deaths of iraqi people is general david petraeus correct when he says that the troop increase is bringing security to iraq
687413 i think its worth it sic one last effort for sure to try to get this right because my personal view is weve simply been managing our way to defeat and i think that if its done right i think that there is the chance to accomplish something
687414 continue to struggle to achieve national level political reconciliation and improved governance
687415 are you looking to end this war or win it
687416 for my part i travel not to go anywhere but to go i travel for travels sake the great affair is to move to feel the needs and hitches of our life more nearly to come down off this feather bed of civilization and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints
687417 but im going to go straight through him thats what im made to do
687418 but in the ufc i wasnt beating my opponents like i would like to beat them
687419 when i was in the u k the light heavyweights are a little smaller than what they are here in the states i was running straight through guys i only had one loss but i wasnt beating my opponents as i would like to beat them so i said to myself when i get beat ill drop down
687420 i lost a split decision to rashad evans so i dropped down i think thats one of the best things i ever did for my whole career i feel faster stronger
687421 most people when they talk about chris leben they say hes a brawler and things like that
687422 sure he may like to brawl but hes got legitimate skills you cant fight in the ufc as long as he has and be around the mma scene that long without picking up all the necessary skills
687423 hes got a decent ground game decent wrestling hes got decent striking he looks very unorthodox the way he fights but obviously it works for him hes beaten a lot of fighters
687424 everyone knows how hard he hits and people talk about his iron chin
687425 i think hes going to come out swinging and im going to do the same i think its going to be a great fight for the fans
687426 i think if i go in there and bring my a game i can beat him im expecting a good fight
687427 ive still got things i want to work on but im happy with the progress ive made every few months that go by im getting better and better maybe if i keep winning two or three more fights which would be a year hopefully ill get a title shot
687428 on oct 18 hes just another opponent thats going to get his ass kicked
687429 have fun and help osu get ready for stanford day 2
687430 deadwood day 1 at osu no roster surprises but there is concern about jeremy perry
687431 we were watching that play on film said osu defensive end slade norris
687432 is that guys going into their senior year you would think they would get into the greatest shape of their lives youve got to be totally committed with your approach to the game i dont know what hes thinking
687433 the cells in the body react to emfs in cell phones just like they do to other environmental toxins including heavy metals and chemicals
687434 cell phones give off radiation any time theyre turned on so that they can communicate with base stations
687435 the radiation emitted however is stronger and more frequent when youre talking or messaging
687436 yes since childrens nervous systems are still developing and they have thinner scalps and skulls than adults they should use cell phones only in emergencies
687437 we are very concerned about teen cell phone use fearing that we face an epidemic of brain tumors 10 to 20 years from now and there are so few who are raising warning flags
687438 if you could step into my head tell me would you still know me
687439 and if i made you mad today tell me would you love me tomorrow
687440 please or would you say that you dont care and then leave me standing here
687441 failure taught me things about myself that i could have learned no other way such knowledge is a true gift for all that it is painfully won

687541 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
687542 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
687543 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
687544 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
687545 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
687546 well maybe it will as its part of a larger energy package
687547 you have to play it by ear a little honey
687548 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
687549 anything that gets in the way of all of us as a team putting that message across effectively is a distraction from what needs to be done and is in danger of letting david cameron win by default
687550 we desperately need to find a way out of this mess and to end the personal dog fighting and to help restore some dignity to the standing of the labour party and our government
687551 in chaos at a time when britain faces serious challenges
687552 the labour party is clearly split right down the middle with some backing brown and others trying to knife him
687553 it is clear that the main political opportunities are where people are looking for an alternative to the labour government as they do in many northern cities and in the midlands where the tories are nowhere and we are the effective opposition
687554 ich glaube es kommt darauf an dass man alle verschiedenen disziplinen fahren kann street fahren downhill fahren big mountain fahren und das alles dann kombinieren um bei so einem slopes elevent gut zu sein man muss viel bike kontrolle haben und sich einfach sicher sein bei den sachen die man macht aber das wichtigste ist dass alle hier locker sind und viel spa haben
687555 das durchschnittsalter der g ste das fr her vorgeherrscht hat ist durch die biker massiv nach unten gedr ckt worden und wir brauchen einfach genauso wie im wintersport auch im sommer junge leute die nachkommen das ist mit den bikern ideal gelungen und da sind wir sehr froh dar ber dass es eine frischzellenkur gegeben hat

687559 ive seen old plastic shopping bags re birthed into what else recycled shopping bags at target
687560 why is it that people in offices always have round conference tables decisions dont get made around round conference tables
687561 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
687562 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
687563 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
687564 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
687565 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
687566 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us

687573 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
687574 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
687575 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
687576 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
687577 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
687578 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
687579 i follow with deep friendship this great sporting event the most important and awaited on a world level and i wish that it offer the international community a valid example of coexistence among people of different background in the respect of common dignity

687594 first you help inject race into the campaign and raise its focus as an issue as the mccain campaign did yesterday with a little door opening from obama himself
687595 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
687596 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
687597 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
687598 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
687599 john mccain not serious silly ads silly attacks trivial like his choice of two female celebrities hes not to be taken seriously sings silly songs about bombing whines when criticized denies his own wrongdoing john mccain unserious in serious times
687600 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you cunt
687601 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
687602 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
687603 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me

687606 hes a very intelligent man and he has a lot of interesting ideas
687607 hes basically being blamed for every bicycle that has disappeared over many many years in toronto
687608 he just has a very unique way of looking at things
687609 he was a good employer even though he could be demanding at times
687610 i find it very hard to believe what people are saying about him
687611 i cannot believe that he would tell someone to steal a bike
687612 he was just very unapproachable and almost condescending to people who would ask questions
687613 there is no way in hell this will pass so im not going to waste time signing this

687666 i know theyre our fiercest rivals but martin needed a few players fit i needed a few fit so we organised a game between ourselves and it was a bit spicy to say the least
687667 it was incredible i dont know who the referee was but he played his part he let everything go it was just what both of us wanted it was a proper no holds barred game expect the same again on sunday
687668 martin and i just stood there enjoying it we got far more out of it than you could get out on the training pitch you dont normally get that kind of game but ive got the hugest respect for martin hes a football person
687669 it was lively stuff quite strong really and i dont think either of us expected it to get as feisty as it did

687701 if you really want to bring the house down say something that is obviously true but it has to be something everyone knows at least in his heart something that everyone is thinking subconsciously perhaps but fairly near the surface be the first person to say aloud what everyone in the room is thinking and then you may watch the ceiling come down

687705 we need to conserve that bitter impulse that we have inherited from primitive man it alone permits us the greatest luxury of all the ability to enjoy a vacation from the human condition through an authentic immersion in nature and this in turn can be achieved only by placing himself in relation to another animal but there is no animal pure animal other than a wild one and the relationship with him is the hunt

687714 i am left asking myself why the green media have neglected the water aspect of pickens wind farm plans have we been so distracted by the prospect of texas renewable energy portfolio growing by 4000 megawatts that we are willing to overlook some potentially dodgy aspects to the project
687715 there is no instrument of hard work savings and job creation as effective as the family

687719 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
687720 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
687721 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving
687722 primarily it starts with the fact does brett want to play football
687723 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only two parties can make that determination not me

687726 it is puzzling to the court that the promotion of tolerance would take the appearance of such intolerance as is contained in the religious materials distributed with the safe space program
687727 the judge ruled in favor of the georgia tech free speech zone policy and the use of student activity fees
687728 georgia tech practices are exactly the same as before the suit was filed
687729 anyone with passing familiarity of the instant litigation would not be faulted for questioning the accuracy of numerous portions of this short press release
687730 t he courts order on summary judgment certainly indicates potential constitutional pitfalls to the manner in which georgia tech administers its student activity fee program based on head the relevant precedent the court finds that plaintiffs are the only prevailing party in this litigation
687731 defendants dean ray and president clough in their official and individual capacities had violated the establishment clause by favoring one religion over another in the state associated safe space program
687732 directed defendants to remove the religious information from the safe space training manual
687733 defendants motion for reconsideration is based on an assertion that religious material had been removed from the office of diversity programs safe space web site a year prior to the courts ruling this was certainly news to the court this court had been dealing with motions regarding the religious material for about eight months and used every means known to it to encourage settlement at no time did the attorney general for the state of georgia even hint that the issue was moot and instead continued to litigate aggressively

687742 yesterday evening abu mazen abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank

687797 there needs to be something in it for the local manufacturers
687798 the ftas in place have led to trade distortions and components substitution away from australia thereby discouraging production in australia
687799 for example as there is no duty on imported components from thailand it is cheaper for car makers to import fully built components and modules than it is to import components and assemble modules here
687800 the thai free trade agreement was presented here as a fantastic opportunity for the local industry

687854 if big brown finishes out the year the right way im going to quit trying to figure it out im still kind of concerned about what is going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in good condition i have no idea what happened in that race but if it happens again im going to know something is wrong with him and he is not going to run anymore
687855 i believe big brown is a horse that should run in the travers because hes the best 3 year old and thats the best race to win during the summer
687856 i really want to run in the travers but the breeders cup classic oct 25 at santa anita is more important than the travers
687857 he looks great hes on top of his game except for his last start he has done everything you would ever want a horse to do i cant see him doing anything but run his race

687910 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
687911 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
687912 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
687913 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us

687921 clearly it depends on the exact positioning of the ambulance
687922 i think there is a very definite message here for members of the public that they do need to consider which part of the nhs national health service that they want to access so cases like this become more and more rare
687923 there is no doubt that at the time we did not have a vehicle close enough to help the gentleman that is very regrettable
687924 on the rare occasions that a situation like this occurs the nhs trust will always investigate the circumstances to see what if any lessons can be learned

687959 manufacturers and retailers must also understand the geographical differences in terms of acceptance and perception of organic food for example in asia pacific perceptions of price of organic foods is more a challenge in eight out of 13 markets studied and in thailand and china in particular credibility turned out to be the major consideration

687995 is there an absolutely vital national interest that should lead us from containment to unilateral war and a long term occupation of iraq and would such a war and its aftermath actually increase our ability to win the war against international terrorism
687996 the first reality of war is that wars often have unintended consequences ask the germans who in world war i were convinced that they would defeat the french in exactly 42 days the second is that a long term occupation of iraq would beyond doubt require an adjustment of force levels elsewhere and could eventually diminish american influence in other parts of the world
687997 in japan american occupation forces quickly became 50 000 friends in iraq they would quickly become 50 000 terrorist targets
687998 i am really proud of the way we played in this test match
687999 the first test was one of those games where nothing went right for us but the way we have come back after four days its really amazing
688000 i am really proud of the fact that i have this group of players who have shown so much resilience not just once but time and time again
688001 the way viru sehwag got those runs scoring 201 out of 329 is something that is really amazing
688002 and also taking that forward to the second innings is never easy it was brilliant batting our opening partnerships in both innings were very important for us
688003 i thought chasing 307 on a fourth day pitch was a good score to chase but its important you get a good start in any run chase
688004 we didnt get that and being 10 for three was obviously not ideal were very disappointed with those last two sessions

688023 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period
688024 what senator obama has said is that he is committed to restoring sound long term fiscal conditions
688025 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare
688026 he has promised he would veto every bill that has them barack obama has voted for bills that are laden with pork whether its the 2005 bush cheney energy bill the 2008 agricultural subsidy bill both of those john mccain voted against because they were laden with pork both of those barack obama voted for
688027 john mccain has been very explicit in saying he does not support an increase in payroll taxes particularly because they impact small businesses and sole proprietorships more greatly than any other part of our economy
688028 his record is very clear on that and he has a number of economists who support his assertion that we can solve the social security and medicare crisis but particularly social security without raising payroll taxes
688029 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely to continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
688030 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
688031 i certainly agree with him that the situation could get worse
688032 and there are a couple of things that will make it worse one is to raise taxes which is what senator obama proposes to do another is to massively increase government spending which is what senator obama would propose to do over 1 5 trillion in increased government spending and the third is to become isolationist and protectionist which senator obama would also propose to do
688033 what senator obama said is that hell have a middle class tax cut and that tax cut will go to roughly 95 percent of all the people whose incomes are under 250 000
688034 for people whose incomes are in excess of 250 000 their income tax rates will go back to the rates we had under president clinton their capital gains rate will go up to some rate less than the rate we had during most of the time president clinton was in office taxes on dividends will go up to the rate that will apply to capital gains and that will be substantially below the rate that was in place when president clinton was elected
688035 what he said with respect to offshore drilling is its going to have no effect in the short term zero that its going to take years for this to come on board
688036 on the other hand youre referring to the proposal that came up friday in which offshore drilling was a piece of a much larger piece of legislation
688037 what he basically said as i understand it and i think this is right is that theres a lot in there that he thinks could be constructive
688038 and if it means doing something that he has a lot of reservations about in order to accomplish something much larger thats constructive then thats the way a legislative process should work in a democracy

688074 the value of ones life is not the number of years an individual spent on earth but the impact he made on others
688075 if we continue to look at our individual countries it will be difficult for us to grow
688076 the lack of emphasis on morality or the over emphasis of academic excellence in our educational institutions has affected all aspects of our social lives
688077 this is a clear indication that there are demand problems which affect the entire economy
688078 we couldnt have done this if the real sector was weak
688079 if we were doing monetary targeting money supply will not grow to the current levels of about 40 per cent with credit to the private sector growing by 50 per cent
688080 cheap credit to them is important but this should be a policy option financed through the budget
688081 this is good news for the private sector and they should position themselves to take advantage of it

688117 the door is open they just need to step through it by suspending their enrichment of uranium
688118 i am not mediating and i dont carry any message from any western country
688119 i am having the time of my life like everyone else in the army were up to our necks in work and problems big and little but this work is fun i could not conceive of a better job except of course having ones own regiment im regimental executive command the 1st battalion and run a training school four afternoons per week i hope the students dont know it but i learn more than they do
688120 and ive seen it but this was unique this wasnt being eaten out this was eisenhower having a buffet supper and i was the complete meal
688121 im going to tell you something lieutenant and youd better listen carefully this morning you did something wrong and i bawled you out for it that was the end we dont carry grudges around here
688122 i study them well and i prepare lectures on them
688123 so again im looking down a pen instead of a gun
688124 im weary of these eternal staff details id like to get a command of my own even if just a squad
688125 damn it as soon as you get a promotion they start talking about another one why cant they let a guy be happy with what he has they take all the joy out of it
688126 in my judgment that position demands a younger man one possessing broad vision progressive ideas a thorough grasp of the magnitude of the problem involved in handling an army and lots of initiative and resourcefulness colonel dwight d eisenhower infantry is such a man and i urgently request that he be detailed to third army
688127 not even when they lived in places that had artificial fireplaces
688128 sir my mother wrote me that my job in this war was to take care of you if general eisenhower doesnt come back from this war dont you dare come back
688129 luckily ive spent most of my life in large headquarters so am not overpowered by the mass of details
688130 we had to get together something of an army pretty darn fast
688131 if all else fails you have your receipt right buy from reputable dealers only save all receipts and be sure to know their return policy in advance
688132 we need a battle royal for a number 1 contender
688133 at first i thought clay was wearing khakis i thought there was no way that would be possible but as he got closer and closer i realized he was definitely wearing khakis khakis with pleats and one of those polo shirts with the giant logo the size of your hand i told myself that maybe he was making some kind of weird meta statement about how much first dates resemble job interviews so i just kissed his cheek and we went inside

688136 tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger
688137 god allowed hurricane katrina to destroy new orleans because he was annoyed with gay people especially barney frank
688138 you are so blinded by your hatred of bush that you cannot understand that all intelligence has uncertainty
688139 and all presidents rely on the consensus and by the way this was a column about mortgage fraud of a circle of advisors
688140 clintons major advisor in this area was a man named sandy berger nuff said
688141 correct me if im wrong but isnt this exactly what peluso did when he was investigating the aisenbergs and lied about the content of secret wiretapped record
688142 naturism is a great human equalizer its about accepting yourself and others for who you are and not what you look like its about de stressing relaxing getting back to innocence
688143 tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger
688144 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth

688146 im sorry to be a nuisance but we wish to claim political asylum
688147 i hit 18 greens so what can i say its an ironic game
688148 i thought that was very special i waved at the guys and they clapped and i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause
688149 i really didnt care about the rain i just enjoyed the moment walking up 18 it didnt really matter
688150 you push a button and its work focus there were times when there was a little opening and feelings start to play thats what happened here on the last hole and im glad this game has meant so much to me and if i didnt feel anything it would be weird
688151 i love the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit the perfect 6 iron and make the putt and to win championships
688152 thats why i spent all of the time on the putting green and the driving range
688153 i have a lot of opportunities ahead of me if this was the end and i had nothing to do that would be very sad but i have new ones im creating a new chapter in my life
688154 oh its gone forever boo hoo im going to go make everyone feel bad now
688155 well hey i looked everywhere for it i did everything in my power to find it if i dont have it now then i guess im not meant to have it
688156 whichever car lane i ever end up in moves the slowest
688157 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
688158 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
688159 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
688160 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

688171 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
688172 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
688173 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
688174 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
688175 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
688176 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
688177 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
688178 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
688179 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
688180 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

688183 but i thought it was horrible when i saw the pictures on the internet about lung cancer so i thought i would stop
688184 smoking is a killer its a very bad killer and i dont want my kids to die with it
688185 i say they should stop because of lung cancer and it might kill them
688186 i couldnt run as fast as i could before i started smoking and i couldnt jump its good to stop

688208 it is in our interests to be patient to get the deal done
688209 hey mention me in your column and ill buy you lunch or something
688210 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
688211 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability
688212 and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
688213 we started the decade with surpluses and we had good federal revenues
688214 but instead because of the fiscal policies put in place we had deficits through all this period

688216 i think thats essential if were going to have a good and strong economy he said hell pay for everything hes going to do with respect to social security and medicare

688260 theyre multi coloured their genus and species names mean mouth feet and genital fingers they can move each eye independently they see the world in 11 or 12 primary colours as opposed to our humble three and now we find that this species can see a world invisible to the rest of us
688261 scuba divers know them as thumb splitters theyve got wickedly strong claws and are very aggressive
688262 this is very useful because natural light can vary from strongly polarised like the glare off snow or water to unpolarised like the sun
688263 any changes to the amount of polarisation instantly tells the animal that something is going on
688264 it cant be the whole story in our case though we found the same structures in the eyes of both boy and girl mantis shrimps and yet neither have circularly polarised markings on their bodies each eye measures the six polarisation components that are precisely required for optimal polarisation vision in fact the physics we used to understand what was going on is the same physics that we use in quantum computing for optimal storage of information
688265 it is this unique talent to measure linear and circular polarisation simultaneously which presents a completely new concept of polarisation vision
688266 there wouldnt be much point in only being able to see circular polarisation as it is extremely rare in nature even the polarized light reflected from some shrimps bodies is only weakly circular polarised and often contains more linear polarisation
688267 we doubt that circular polarisation is used exclusively as a secret shrimp sex signal it makes more sense that mantis shrimp evolved both circular and linear polarisation receptors to work together so they can detect tiniest changes in any polarisation

688287 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
688288 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
688289 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
688290 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
688291 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
688292 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
688293 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties
688294 the impact of the rising fuel prices on the local economy is extremely serious

688305 embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other
688306 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
688307 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages

688737 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
688738 it is the worst tragedy on k2 since 1986 when 12 climbers were killed due to exposure
688739 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain i panicked when a pakistani high altitude carrier fell straight onto my back with his entire weight
688740 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
688741 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
688742 at present it is believed that anyone who is classified as position unknown will not be coming back
688743 the lower they come to the ground the closer they are to safety but they are totally exhausted and not out of danger yet
688744 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
688745 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
688746 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
688747 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
688748 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
688749 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
688750 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
688751 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
688752 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
688753 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
688754 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
688755 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
688756 we need to learn from the west not only allowing freedom of speech but also allowing people to gather and express their political views
688757 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
688758 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
688759 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
688760 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
688761 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
688762 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
688763 time to make my bed and lie in it for several hours
688764 can i go can i go can i go are we going are we going are we going

688773 so i have time for them on week ends in my wonderful mansion of course not in ibadan those are little boys to us anyway
688774 although wealth was unlikely to make anyone miserable wealth alone would not make people truly happy
688775 if we had money without friends freedom and an analysed life we will never be truly happy and if we have them but are missing a fortune we will never be unhappy
688776 it may be a 4 4 that we purchase but it was freedom that we were looking for
688777 a person in the midst of doing something objectively worthwhile may not describe himself as happy usually because he is too absorbed to notice only later will he realise that what it is to be happy is to be absorbed in something worthwhile
688778 the only thing we truly have control over is our thoughts
688779 we are what we think all that we are arises within our thoughts with our thoughts we make the world the buddha circa 563 483 bc

688783 el gobierno no quiere dar soluciones pol ticas al tema ind gena
688784 los pueblos ind genas hemos estado preocupados con este tema del monitoreo pues desde abril del 2007 no avanz y por iniciativa de la asamblea del pueblo de guaran de itika guasu se convoca a las organizaciones ind genas de bolivia para hablar de este tema y elegir al representante ind gena que recay en mi persona
688785 las empresas han entrado a nuestras tierras sin respetar las leyes y sin consultarnos ya son diez a os que est n con nosotros y la experiencia que tenemos no es buena pues ya hicimos el monitoreo a sus trabajos y nuestro informes se quedaron en nada porque no hab a donde llevarlos ahora existen los comit donde tenemos nuestro representante
688786 como sabemos que las empresas se va a quedar de 20 a 30 a os en nuestros territorios lo que deben hacer es cumplir con la ley donde se establece nuestros derechos a la consulta al monitoreo de sus actividades y la compensaci n o mitigaci n para paliar aquellos da os que si o si traen las empresas petroleras si se cumple con todo esto creo que seguiremos viviendo en nuestras tierras junto a nuestro hijos y los hijos de nuestro hijos

688788 los problemas aparejados por la extracci n ilegal de madera en la frontera brasil per vienen siendo denunciados intensivamente desde 1998 desde entonces los gobiernos de ambos pa ses han formado comisiones para resolver el problema pero nunca llegaron a acuerdos claros ni realizaron acciones contundentes para frenar la situaci n
688789 5 dear friend you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers even though they are strangers to you 6 they have told the church about your love you will do well to send them on their way that they went out receiving no help from the pagans 8 we ought therefore to show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth
688790 share with gods people who are in need practice hospitality
688791 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
688792 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
688793 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
688794 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
688795 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
688796 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
688797 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
688798 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
688799 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
688800 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
688801 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
688802 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
688803 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
688804 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
688805 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
688806 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate
688807 but it also guarantees the right of all paraguayans to have access to a piece of land
688808 there is a pent up demand in paraguay that has been barely satisfied
688809 im concerned there may be a little wishful thinking as to how easily it can be done
688810 it was really tough to try to decide who was who and who should we hit
688811 i know at times we were ordered to strafe refugees in fact i pulled fighters off refugees at times
688812 that was a typical observation for a pilot and observer

688842 we need to repent of statements and actions that have further damaged the dignity of homosexual persons

688880 f r die n chste produktion im herbst werden wir eine rolle f r sie finden
688881 barbara ist eine begnadete k nstlerin eine der besten deutschen schauspielerinnen berhaupt
688882 es war nicht nur die brust befallen sondern auch die leber und die knochen
688883 dass sie ihr leiden so ffentlich gemacht hat erfordert extrem viel st rke und zehrt gewiss an ihren kr ften sie gibt damit so vielen menschen mut und hoffnung die sich in einer hnlichen lebenslage befinden und vielleicht meinen sie seien ganz allein damit
688884 wenn sie selbst es sich k rperlich zutraut w re es mir eine ehre mit ihr zu drehen wohin es geht wissen wir noch nicht vielleicht ins mittelmeer vielleicht in die s dsee das entscheidet sich in den n chsten wochen ich werde barbara demn chst kontaktieren
688885 wolfgang rademann ist ein wunderbarer mensch sobald barbara ihr handy wieder angestellt hat werde ich sie von seinem angebot unterrichten
688886 sie nahm spontan seine h nde und sagte die sehen ja aus wie deine

688898 das champions league finale in rom w re nat rlich ein traum aber mein prim res ziel ist es mit der mannschaft in bundesliga und pokal ganz oben zu stehen das wird schwer genug es gibt ja schlie lich noch schalke bremen und auch hamburg

688924 a porta est aberta at o final de agosto e h tempo por isso n o temos pressa
688925 foi quase uma sensa o de morte fim de um sonho
688926 depois que o pessoal foi embora da sala eu fiquei ali mais de uma hora tentando entender mas n o consegui foi um golpe duro ainda mais de surpresa que avalia o dava para ser feita pelo tempo em que eu estava ali eu fiquei uns tr s ou quatro dias chateado se voc me perguntar os motivos eu realmente n o sei
688927 eu vou perguntar numa boa sem entrar em pol mica pois nunca tive problema com bernardo
688928 se eu estivesse mal tudo bem eu seria o primeiro a pedir para sair mas n o foi isso o que aconteceu por isso foi t o dif cil eu perdi o ch o fiquei sem rumo mal comparando foi uma sensa o de quase morte foi a morte de um sonho que acabou de uma hora para outra
688929 ele nem muito de falar mas se emocionou e chorou eu nunca o tinha visto chorando antes mas naquele momento ele s queria me abra ar
688930 s o coisas normais e ele como um dos pilares do grupo questionou isso corretamente com o pr prio bernardo
688931 acredito no ouro conhe o bem esse time e tenho certeza de que eles v o reagir s o homens de gana de moral e jogadores excepcionais se eles n o ganharem o ouro ser por circunst ncias do jogo e n o por outro motivo eles est o mordidos e vai ser muito dif cil ganhar do brasil
688932 o certo que eu quero continuar jogando mas s vou assinar com algum clube e ficar longe de casa em um esquema bem redondo essa condi o n o pintou ainda e tenho de me manter e ser na praia n o sei se para voltar definitivamente mas quem sabe se eu estiver bem n o possa jogar um torneio vamos ver
688933 foi uma corrida dif cil est vamos muito lentos e nos faltava ader ncia o carro sa a muito de traseira e n o podia for ar s tentava mant lo na pista
688934 de todas as formas um ponto melhor do que nada
688935 minha largada n o foi perfeita mas fui bem pude passar tr s carros na primeira volta mas depois ficou dif cil porque o carro estava muito pesado
688936 decidimos fazer s uma parada ent o meu carro quase cheio de combust vel na largada e tamb m tinha que cuidar dos pneus
688937 eu n o conseguia chegar no ritmo dos que estavam minha frente agora temos que analisar a falta de ritmo dos carros hoje normalmente este um dos nossos pontos fortes
688938 tivemos um ritmo muito ruim durante a corrida nenhum dos pilotos conseguiu chegar aos tempos de volta que esper vamos depois das sess es de sexta e s bado
688939 foi muito bom jogar contra ele novamente no segundo set a partida ficou de alto n vel e ele teve set point mesmo com a chuva conseguimos terminar bem e agora s quero alguns dias de descanso novamente
688940 o s lido resultado de hoje encorajador para todo o time nossos dois pilotos fizeram um grande trabalho e estamos agora prontos para continuar andando forte na segunda metade do campeonato e terminar em quarto no campeonato de construtores

688946 nat rlich bin ich in einer gro artigen form ich bin in der lage jedes eintages rennen zu gewinnen und die strecke m sste mir auch liegen mein ziel ist auf jeden fall eine medaille in den letzten jahren haben wir deutschen jedenfalls bewiesen dass wir mit der absoluten weltspitze mithalten k nnen letztes jahr bei der wm in stuttgart habe ich gezeigt dass ich gewinnen kann
688947 ich habe nach meinen erfolgen bei der tour beide rennen im kopf
688948 ich stelle mich den fragen hoffe aber dass es jetzt wieder um den sport geht
688949 bei gro er hitze und smog habe ich so meine probleme
688950 ich bin total entt uscht ich hatte auf meiner schnellen runde vier autos vor mir drei haben wenigstens platz gemacht
688951 das hat mich eine halbe sekunde gekostet er hat sich zwar entschuldigt aber das hat mir wohl das rennen kaputt gemacht
688952 ich habe ihn hinter mir gesehen aber was h tte ich anders machen sollen ich wollte auch meine runde fahren
688953 then for goodness sake tell me what it is dont keep me in suspense
688954 and in the evening he would walk a little for exercise then return to his work again eventually
688955 es impresionante la cantidad de veces que te revisan pero est bien porque es para la seguridad
688956 n s estivemos completamente fora de ritmo durante toda a prova
688957 n s n o fomos r pidos o bastante n o t nhamos feito um trabalho muito bom na classifica o o que nos afetou na corrida enfrentamos problemas para encontrar um melhor rendimento
688958 hoje s bado ele jogou de forma inacredit vel no primeiro set no segundo senti que estava melhor finalmente ele me quebrou no 5 5 ent o tenho apenas que parabeniz lo por ter jogado t o bem voc s sabem como o t nis duro provavelmente n o estava com 100 das minhas condi es
688959 durante toda a semana n o joguei o que podia acho at que no segundo set estive melhor que em outros dias aqui por isso saio bastante feliz termino a semana com timas sensa es principalmente ap s ter feito um torneio de toronto perfeito foi sem d vida a melhor temporada em quadras sint ticas da minha carreira
688960 mas claro que do jeito que ele nadal vinha jogando todos n s pensamos que ele n o perderia t o cedo
688961 tentei apenas n o ficar lembrando desta s rie de vit rias e nem no seu novo ranking ainda n o oficial fiquei apenas concentrado no meu jogo j o havia derrotado tr s vezes neste piso anteriormente e sabia o que fazer contra ele nas quadras sint ticas
688962 a quebra aconteceu sem nenhum aviso sem dar a menor indica o eu estava administrando a corrida porque tinha uma boa vantagem para o segundo lugar ap s o incidente de hamilton eu n o estava me arriscando

689136 one of my goals when i joined the tour was to win an event and i wasnt sure if it was going to happen since ill be stepping away after this season
689137 but the waves pumped this event this is what the dream tour should be like all the time im definitely stepping away from the asp tour at the end of this year but im not retiring im still planning on competing at pipeline and teahupoo and at venues that i can get into
689138 i was tripping out in the water when they kept announcing fred patacchia and i in the final you never hear that
689139 it was all business though this is only the second time ive ever made one on tour and i wasnt about to let it go i was trying my hardest out there
689140 my brother has won this event twice and all i could think about in the final is how i wanted that trophy
689141 the thing is sick it was a great event and were going to have a huge party tonight
689142 bruce irons and i are good friends but we were super competitive in that final
689143 both of us wanted to win and we were hassling and trash talking and everything i had one wave at the start but bruce got two bombs towards the end and i could tell he was really gunning for it
689144 it feels great to come back after a slow start to the year
689145 the waves were so good for this event and im bummed i didnt win but to have bruce irons there and since hes stepping away it feels good that we kept the title within hawaii
689146 if i had come out of that one barrel then i would have been in the final but ive had a great day and a 3rd place finish really helps me this year the next event is in my backyard lower trestles and im pretty confident out there ill be spending a lot of time preparing for that event but first i am going to enjoy this magical island and all the beautiful waves it has to offer
689147 this is the best result of my career and it takes the pressure off of me to get a 3rd at the halfway point this season
689148 i dont know what it will do to the ratings but it should help me and give me a better seed going into lower trestles i have a pretty busy summer i am doing all the asp wqs events in europe so it is a lot of surfing for me coming up

689161 its just fantastic a great moment and one that ive been targeting for many years now ever since i first saw the possibility of being a formula one driver
689162 of course i felt sorry for felipe and even for lewis as they both drove a great race but i know how they feel as i have had similar moments myself this year
689163 there was not much i could do at the start but after that i tried to just keep it tidy and tight and not go too hard on the tyres in the first two stints which is where i had problems earlier in the season
689164 i tried to push felipe as much as possible at the end and when i saw a car on fire with big smoke coming out on the main straight i thought it must be felipe but it was hard to believe
689165 after that of course there was no rush anymore i just had to bring it home its a great moment for myself and for the team who worked with me through all the hard times
689166 what i said wrong what i did maybe i was too fast
689167 we are extremely proud of the many heroic and brave achievements of our son and brother gerard
689168 the last few days have been a roller coaster of emotions as we celebrated with joy hs historic achievment and now we must try to come to terms with the untimely loss of a great son brother and friend
689169 following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country at gerard becoming the first irish person to scale k2 it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother
689170 it is total and utter shock and every time a friend passes away like this it is just numbing
689171 we have confirmation now that 145 people have been killed
689172 we found eight to 10 stones which had fallen off and probably scared the people causing the stampede
689173 many children and women were shouting for help and i saw people tumbling down the hillside
689174 there were rumours of boulders coming down on us and we all ran like the others
689175 there were too many rumours we tried our best to keep things under control but it went out of hand
689176 we create the tools to allow them to implement their expertise
689177 well the fbis been here for about a year we knew that they have been here for a long time i would see them all the time so i mean we werent sure exactly what was happening but we knew there was something going on on our street but we never suspected bruce i mean we never you know and i still dont you know look at him unfavorably or anything because he was a really decent guy
689178 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided and i think it should be soon
689179 napa ko ni macam sedih ni jan ko gitu ba
689180 its something ive been thinking about for some time and really it was thursday night the night before i made the century believe it or not and thats when i told the wife and i knew it was time to go
689181 this is a fantastic first year for the book bag campaign our statistics show that the average person in devon visits the library five times a year if everyone who purchased one used it just to carry their books to and from the library each time that could be as many as 35 000 plastic bags saved
689182 this is a great start to the devon book bag campaign and its good to see more people becoming aware of the benefits of investing in bags for life and its not just for carrying books as these bags are stylish enough to use for shopping or on a visit to the beach so hopefully they are saving the need for other plastic bags
689183 did you pick that up we need to play that ball
689184 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
689185 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages

689487 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges
689488 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the believes or intends
689489 there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized
689490 unsurprisingly that there are also defendants who appeared to leave out certain unsavory details
689491 begged them for me to take it but they wouldnt let me they said i couldnt come back to the store for three more years
689492 it was probably one of the most aggressive races that i have ever been in i would say it was even more aggressive than my race in osaka last year in the world championships there was anything from elbows to people kicking your heel
689493 when journalists couldnt reach certain web sites from the beijing press center last week the olympic organizers made a huge mistake they admitted to censorship
689494 beijing must have assumed that it had implicit permission to block the web sites of amnesty international falun gong practitioners activists for tibetan independence and an array of news organizations why do it otherwise the blackouts werent about to go unnoticed

689512 he tried for it last year and he got very very close and i think he was about 10 minutes over the limit
689513 so this year he put the boat in its upright fastest position and really went for it
689514 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
689515 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
689516 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
689517 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
689518 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign
689519 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
689520 the ruler of dubai is an important figure in the emirates and an influential figure around the world
689521 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
689522 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
689523 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
689524 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
689525 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
689526 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
689527 cover up with dark colored clothing thats made of tightly woven fabric or specially treated to block uv radiation
689528 its one of the most absorbed sunscreen blockers which wouldnt necessarily be a concern but it has high toxicity issues
689529 the main criterion for displaying the seal is donating 10 000 to scf to join the corporate council
689530 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
689531 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
689532 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
689533 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
689534 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
689535 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
689536 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
689537 if i can get paid to do that then im in
689538 the negotiations on agriculture and nama non agricultural market access should be complementary and should work side by side rather than being adversarial wherein the gains of one will be taken from sacrificing the other
689539 however it also gives us the opportunity to rethink our approach and focus our strategies for the mean time on the second best solution offered by ftas and bilateral agreements
689540 its hard to absorb all the costs because the coal affects 40 percent of our variable cost
689541 because the price of coal continues to move up the government cannot hold off power rates increases
689542 the price of diesel is rising and this means that freight charges are also increasing
689543 the latest data showed that demand for cement went down 0 3 percent when compared to the same period the previous year
689544 t will be a short ceremony the philippines is one of several countries holding their respective flag raising rites tomorrow today
689545 weve just decided that it penalty should be increased because 750 000 is peanuts for oscar dela hoya
689546 oscar dela hoya would be more than willing to pay 750 000 per pound and would come in at 150 plus during the weigh in
689547 the penalty will be commensurate to his dela hoya pocket
689548 even though they are coming abroad to better their financial situation many of the women find themselves in a worse financial situation due to loans and debt repayment
689549 after debt payments remittances and necessary living costs many domestic workers find that they have overspent themselves because of the low wage levels in hong kong because of these factors many are forced to seek out loans
689550 they are paying those debts by taking other loans kailan sila hihinga hindi ko maintindihan paanong nabubuhay iyan minsan patigasan na lang kapag mabait ang pinagkakautangan napapakiusapan pa pero minsan nagtatago na sila nahihiya when can they breathe freely i dont see how they can survive like that sometimes its a matter of will if the lender is kind they can be talked to in order to ease the repayment terms but if not the workers will simply keep hiding
689551 thats what coach black wants me to do to play defense
689552 i feel we just got back to whats really got us all to a good start thats playing defense
689553 were in good position right now going into the second round we also got our confidence back
689554 we basically cut down our double teaming today and took away some of their perimeter game and shut down their shooters im always satisfied when we play defense they shot 27 percent thats pretty good defense
689555 we made some crucial adjustments late in the game these made the difference
689556 the board has decided to deny the appeal of ue so the results of that game will stand
689557 the understanding of the board is that the cash bond of p100 000 is only per issue ue gave p200 000 cash bond the second cash bond was returned to ue since the appeal was all about the same issue
689558 the board saw human error this is not only for basketball but for all sports there is always the possibility of officials committing human error officials are not infallible
689559 the true essence of sports is that all competitors all teams would have to learn how to live by these errors after all it evens out and while it was unfortunate that ue was the one who suffered in this particular error it is not always ue that will suffer since all member universities are also exposed to this same risk
689560 the board also took into consideration the need to have games decided on the court rather than in the boardroom
689561 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
689562 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
689563 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer

689567 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
689568 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
689569 these groups have said we cant survive four more years of this
689570 it is something that really gets people out in the streets
689571 its not directed specifically against the republicans thats for certain
689572 its against the warmakers but even people marching dont necessarily have to see things as broadly as i do
689573 three weeks ago i promised to bring it down to 50 sen but now because of the drop in oil prices we can reduce it by 70 sen
689574 it was 8 30 in the morning and i was standing in an overflow of sounds smells and sights flanked by bouquets of daisies on my right and ox tongues on my left
689575 there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 a senior u s official said

689580 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there

689586 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
689587 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
689588 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing

689601 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
689602 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges
689603 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
689604 there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized
689605 we may not have put an end to all our problems
689606 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
689607 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
689608 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
689609 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
689610 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
689611 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
689612 the cast of amazing people theyre hot obviously adds to the excitement
689613 its like harry potter plus romance plus good looking people
689614 i still cant really come to terms with it as soon as one person started to recognize me literally now im just freaking out the whole time
689615 and author stephenie meyer wrote edward as like the perfect guy
689616 there are so many girls out there who do not know kung fu and if a guy jumps in the alley theyre not going to turn around with a roundhouse kick
689617 theres a lot of people who are just quieter and arent having the prada lifestyle and going to a special school in new york where everyones rich and fabulous theres normal people out there and i think thats one of the reasons bella has become so popular
689618 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
689619 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
689620 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
689621 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
689622 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign

689628 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
689629 one of the great things about the canadian team is that guys always have to earn their opportunities to show up
689630 theres never anything given to anybody as far as guaranteed spots you have to earn it and thats what we like most about having these camps
689631 i was surprised to be there and im happy to be there
689632 i thought he did fine for a player his age
689633 i thought he came in and got better every day he looked more comfortable hes got a high skill level and he showed that
689634 he did all the things he needed to do to impress people
689635 a lot of times guys come in and dont play the game that theyre capable of trying to guess what the coaches might be looking for but maxime came in and played exactly the style that hes used to
689636 being drafted is just a little part of my life
689637 my first goal is to play for the big club if not ill play for ahl providence when i turn 20

689639 for decades health insurers have gamed the system and reaped billions
689640 fear can hold you prisoner hope can set you free
689641 let me tell you something you already know the world aint all sunshine and rainbows it is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it aint bout how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take and keep moving forward thats how winning is done now if you know what youre worth then go out and get what youre worth but you gotta be willing to take the hit and not pointing fingers saying you aint where you are because of him or her or anybody cowards do that and that aint you youre better than that
689642 reinforce the idea that many children dont spend enough time playing in the green outdoors and enjoying wildlife something older generations might have taken for granted
689643 ive sat in front of this computer for 20 minutes trying to put into words how i feel who all to thank and how to celebrate this is a true honour and i am humbled by it
689644 its way harder to dress down than to dress up casual is the true test of an outfit master old men dress the best theyll just be sitting in the park with a missoni sweater some tonal khakis and some new balance sneakers and youre like damn that outfit is perfect
689645 it was hell how could they not tell civilians from north korean troops
689646 they wouldnt have died like that if they had allowed the refugees to pass through their lines
689647 across a stream there were u s soldiers with a tank they blocked us
689648 my feelings were indescribable because not all of us could go
689649 and then the fire incinerated everything and spread into the cave
689650 his bowels spilled out his mother fell down and cried over his body in the shower of bullets
689651 it was really tough to try to decide who was who and who should we hit
689652 i know at times we were ordered to strafe refugees in fact i pulled fighters off refugees at times
689653 that was a typical observation for a pilot and observer
689654 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
689655 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
689656 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
689657 if there were freedom there would definitely be people protesting
689658 at least half the people i know cant wait for the games to be over its a glorious event for the country but ordinary people are the unlucky ones
689659 i can barely feed myself so what do i care
689660 the fire is continuing while being generally brought under control
689661 the weather was on our side last night but the wind began blowing again this morning still we aim to bring the fire under control today
689662 i was living in a tent and i dont have that much money in prison at least my children have something to eat
689663 but when a mother is in prison for the murder of the father the lives of these children outside im not sure its a good alternative either
689664 if i let my daughter go to live with her uncle he may sell her to someone i will never let him sell her
689665 to whom can i send the children if they go outside
689666 im worried about them having to spend five more years here while they are sick
689667 i try to push her but she cant even stand on her own feet
689668 there is no open place for them to play there is no park they are living with their mothers inside the prison in the room
689669 if a child is breastfeeding it is necessary to be with the mother but there are some children who are 10 11 13
689670 if i go outside i can help my sister cook and wash the clothes i can study go to the mosque study the quran and when i come home i can help my sister wash the dishes

689694 you could hear the thunder getting closer we were counting the time from lightning to thunder three seconds two seconds one second it sounded like a bomb an explosion i felt it was in my head right there our tent is orange and the light coming in was orange but there was a bright white light and flashes of blue

689737 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
689738 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
689739 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
689740 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
689741 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
689742 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
689743 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation

689805 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication
689806 i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever
689807 i am very frustrated at the moment because today we had a great car and we had done everything perfectly until just a few kilometres from the finish
689808 we had given it our all but these things can happen
689809 now we must not give up instead we must react quickly
689810 there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground
689811 our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
689812 today we showed the worth of our team and our drivers but we lacked the total reliability which is absolutely vital
689813 felipe drove possibly the best race of his career and we are very disappointed about what happened to him just a handful of kilometres from the end
689814 he made an amazing start attacking at the right moment and then he was comfortably managing his race in the final stages heading for a well deserved victory
689815 we have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part
689816 we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as well prepared as possible for the european grand prix
689817 its a great result for the team and probably our best race of the year
689818 both cars had to race hard and we had to think our way carefully through to the end of the race
689819 the results and points achieved today are a good reward for lots of hard work in the team and at the factories
689820 we fought hard today and we were on the pace with a car that was working well which is encouraging for the rest of the championship
689821 we scored some important points which is satisfying even though we could have maybe been on the podium
689822 we must now continue working hard but todays result shows that we are moving in the right direction
689823 i scored some valuable points which is promising for the rest of the season
689824 i made a good start but unfortunately i made a small mistake on the first lap which meant that i lost the two positions that i had made up
689825 it shows that at this level you cannot afford to make the smallest error
689826 we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying yesterday which hurt us in the race
689827 we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the toyotas and renaults who were fighting in the championship
689828 lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
689829 unfortunately i got some traffic before my last stop which allowed nick to pass me otherwise i couldnt do anymore today
689830 the car has a lot of oversteer and rear sliding
689831 now well just focus on the next race and see that we can do there
689832 unfortunately we just werent fast enough and it was a circuit that didnt play to our strengths
689833 our nearest rivals both had respectable scores today but well be pushing hard to recover lost ground in the remaining races
689834 we were a bit lucky with all the people going all over the place
689835 we had the speed in the race but if i cannot get the qualifying right we are going to end up every race in the same situation like her in the last race in germany
689836 so we need to sort it out if we can get at the front we can fight for wins
689837 but in this position we can only follow people and cant use the cars speed
689838 so we just need to fix problems then we can be back in hunt for wins
689839 i think we could have managed to do the race a little bit better but we were stuck behind alonso all the way to the second stop
689840 then on the in lap i was eight tenths faster on my own but it was a bit late at that point
689841 but at least we had good cart got in front and i caught timo before we needed to back off in the end
689842 i was ready to try anything but we just needed to back off
689843 we were much faster like we were with alonso but if it is so difficult to get past if the guy in front doesnt make mistake
689844 so you need something special on one corner to get close enough but at least we got behind him but unfortunately i couldnt try to pass him
689845 but third place in the end after a very difficult weekend for me was a good result
689846 we were very slow and i was struggling with the overall grip of the car
689847 i was trying hard to keep the car on the track
689848 my start wasnt perfect but okay as i had hoped i was able to overtake three cars on the first lap
689849 but later it became more difficult than expected to race with the heavy car
689850 we went for a one stop strategy so my car was almost full of fuel at the start and i also had to take care of the tyres
689851 i couldnt match the pace of the cars in front of me
689852 now we have to analyse todays lack of race pace normally this is one of our strengths
689853 neither driver was able to do the lap times we expected after the sessions on friday and saturday it was the same on both tyre compounds
689854 i marvel at all the accomplishments and our growth to think that we started in 1984 with only four members and that today we are 66 how impressive

689862 wahai rasulullah ketika mereka mengucapkan salam yang ringkas kepadamu engkau membalas dengan salam yang lebih baik kalimatnya sedangkan aku memberi salam yang lengkap kepadamu aku terkejut engkau membalasku dengan sangat singkat hanya dengan waalaika
689863 engkau sama sekali tidak menyisakan ruang bagiku untuk yang lebih baik karena itulah aku membalasmu dengan ucapan yang sama sebagaimana yang di jabarkan allah didalam
689864 mengawali mengucapkan salam sifatnya adalah sukarela sedangkan membalasnya adalah kewajiban
