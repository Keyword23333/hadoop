6550222 california is the only state that has not passed a budget this year while the budget battle rages no other legislative matter gets real attention despite an armada of problems requiring state attention water education roads prisons health care housing economic policies and more if this were a rare occurrence then we could look the other way but it has happened 18 of the past 22 years the chief reason is that only rhode island arkansas and california have a constitutional requirement of two thirds legislative budget approval which in california is nearly impossible republicans contend this threshold is their only check on democrats profligate spending but if democrats do overreach more republicans would be elected
6550223 produces wildly fluctuating revenue booms and busts that put state services on a cruel feast or famine roller coaster that drags the poor the elderly children and even the business community along for the painful ride similarly local funding is hogtied to the states forcing our cities and counties to suffer as well from outdated laws in the constitution californias bureaucratic red tape is legendary reflecting nothing of our 21st century economy culture and society
6550224 w e have to ask the question of whether a tax structure that was established in the 1930s is sufficient to meet the needs of californians in 2008

6550238 to celebrate the historic participation of young americans in this years election and in support of the candidacy of barack obama for president
6550239 one of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment
6550240 they are a key to this election and senator obama is energizing this new generation of voters in a way never seen before our party and our politics are better for their participation and i look forward to hosting this extraordinary event on their behalf

6550245 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
6550246 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6550247 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
6550248 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
6550249 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years alot of that was orchestrated through her management rebel one it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen a lot of the money rihanna made through her endorsements between covergirl cosmetics samsung notice that majority of rihannas videos have a cell phone in it
6550250 after the release of rihanna and teairra mari def jam had intention to drop both acts because their album sales were not successful

6550265 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6550266 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life
6550267 she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6550268 her love of people showed and people loved her back
6550269 we just werent a defensive team at all so we knew coming into these olympic games if we faced a game where we didnt score the ball well which we obviously didnt we would have to rely on our defense to win the game and it came to that tonight
6550270 our job was to keep the ball out of beckys hands as much as possible
6550271 we knew that when she gets on a roll the team gets on a roll we tried very hard to get the ball out of her hands and not give her opportunities to score
6550272 sometimes the best offense is to just give the ball to diana and let her operate
6550273 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the united states from engaging in business dealings with iranian nationals

6550275 in the case of ultimate it is trying to shift the customer from a situation where they are calling for a lot of break fix support to the advisory support where they are improving the quality of their it systems so that they dont break as frequently

6550281 unfortunately each week brings a new wave of threats and vulnerabilities to be managed
6550282 ignoring or deferring patches for known vulnerabilities is not a responsible strategy nor is it reasonable for most companies to disconnect their business from the internet so managing vulnerabilities simply has to be done
6550283 its a task which is consuming far too high a percentage of limited it resources
6550284 the fact that leading vendors are calling for collaborative industry wide frameworks to address threats and vulnerabilities is strong evidence of the level of pain being expressed by their top customers in this area
6550285 effectively the changes mean instead of counting instances or processors and licensing by server you are able to count instances or processors and license by server farm
6550286 i think many enterprises will appreciate the application licensing flexibility that microsofts policy change has provided still lets not forget about the small it shops that do not have volume licenses why restrict server os mobility lifting the 90 day licensing transfer restriction across all product lines is simply the right thing to do
6550287 it was a pleasing result for us to beat the host nation australia coach jan stirling said china have played well in the tournament with the exception of their defeat to team usa we knew we had a challenge we cranked up the defense
6550288 lauren jackson had an injection before this game stirling said
6550289 penny will be there for the final but whether she will be fully fit remains to be seen
6550290 for anyone to beat team usa with the depth they have we are going to have to produce our a game of the tournament without question we have to make things happen for us and hopefully that will happen in 48 hours time
6550291 for us its a third time round the track stirling said we are desperate we have to take care of business on the court we have to have a lot of passion but we cannot be emotional about it
6550292 the australians are a much better team than us maher said i was disappointed in how easily distracted we became because of this superiority we werent able to execute our game plan one thing is getting beaten another thing getting whipped their possession game was wonderful ours was pretty ordinary there was no comparison between the two teams
6550293 consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice
6550294 current p2p management is triggered regardless of the level of overall network congestion at th e time and regardless of the time of day
6550295 the record leaves no doubt that comcasts network management practices discriminate among applications and protocols rather than treating all equal
6550296 its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address or type of stamp on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein
6550297 this practice is not minimally intrusive but invasive and outright discriminatory
6550298 discourage the development of technologies such as peer to peer technologies that maximize user control over what information is received by individuals who use the internet because that interference again impedes consumers from run ning applications of their choice rather than those favored by comcast
6550299 should the fcc see evidence that providers of telecommunications for internet access or ip enabled services are violating the principles of the federal policy we will not hesitate to take action to address that conduct
6550300 if you dont comply with our order we will seriously consider thinking about a more convincing order

6550319 i flew on a plane the other day and the airline charged me 40 to put a bag on the plane with fuel costs where they are its become too much of a cost of the business for the it distributor to shoulder that whole burden on their own
6550320 we become more efficient and the customer can avoid multiple 2 handling fees its a win for us and a win for the solution provider
6550321 it is a fact that freight costs are rising faster than sales im sure thats true no matter what industry youre in we dont stock as much in warehouses so we dont do as many small package shipments we do some very special type shipping particularly in the storage space where it has to be a protective ride that is quite expensive were evaluating our position but as of yet havent changed our policy

6550408 obama goes on the offensive as mccain surges into lead at polls
6550409 barack obama has launched a sustained and sharply negative advertising campaign against his republican opponent john mccain who has vaulted into the lead according to an opinion poll released yesterday the first ever black presidential nominee has repeatedly promised that he would transcend the bickering of traditional politics trying to keep that pledge but also the competitive edge mr obama is now running an uplifting national advertising campaign while delivering fierce attacks on his opponent at the local level in key swing states the aggressive fightback comes after republican underdog mccain opened up a five point lead according to a zogby reuters poll published yesterday completely overturning the seven point lead mr obama had in july mr mccain now leads mr obama among likely voters by 46 per cent to 41 per cent the poll found that voters believe mr mccain would be a stronger manager of americas declining economy even though he admits to knowing little about economic issues
6550410 i spent years as a pow with john mccain and his finger should not be near the red button
6550411 obama goes on the offensive as mccain surges into lead at polls
6550412 another known turn on for men is a high rounded voluptuous butt add that to a narrow waistline and you get the classic hourglass figure this so called perfect figure has a ratio of 70 percent such a figure the narrow waist flat abdomen large round easy to grasp fanny historically signaled fertility to the male species women became aware of this particular male lure and went to incredible lengths to draw attention to their curves in the nineteenth century women wore bustles under their skirts to accentuate the size of their hips was this comfortable do you think hell no but what does comfort have to do with it our female predecessors strapped on torturous corsets to reduce their waist size to make the distinction between waist and hip even more obvious and alluring women of that era cinched their waistlines to the point of damaging their rib cages going as far as surgically removing ribs to achieve that perfectly narrow waist ohmygod the corset squeezed their organs and restricted their oxygen intake and turned fainting into a gender oriented pastime according to studies on the subject this ratio has consistently proven to grab a males attention so much so in fact that throughout history it was thought that a woman most capable of bearing children had a waist that was 70 percent smaller than her hips
6550413 i spent years as a pow with john mccain and his finger should not be near the red button
6550414 john mccain is a long time acquaintance of mine that goes way back to our time together at the u s naval academy and as prisoners of war in vietnam
6550415 the bottom line was that we didnt want this to drag on
6550416 i dont want to use tay again i want to give him a chance
6550417 yes when what his work was was to betray me im giving him another chance by allowing him to tear this down after all his treachery has been buried with his own hands then we can start again
6550418 i think its too early to make it public rumors are fine but i will not be used for your propaganda
6550419 i dont want to appear to be in daniels debt
6550420 we have been for too long under the thumb of the forged lord and crushed beneath the wheel of the church we must band together if we are to find a new place for ourselves if we are to raise ourselves up but there are some who do not share our dream some who feel it is better to sell out the dreams of their companions some who feel that this world is not worth sacrifice for them there can be but one fate blam such is the fate of all who would oppose the future who would keep those down that would rise above their stations such is the fate of the old world for we are the new
6550421 we lost a good man today shot like a gaffed pike
6550422 what can we do to convince them that weve actually put the forged lord at risk
6550423 is this affection i feel for him real or is this something you put in my head i dont know any more
6550424 i think its real but remember you chose to let the psychologist in i never would have forced that on you
6550425 tell me why was it makeda that you listened to
6550426 maybe because her family is much like my fathers and mine discontent with their place in this world scrabling for a higher rung a kindred spirit maybe it was just the right words at the right time maybe she said something that resonated with me maybe i wanted to prove myself to you maybe i wanted to prove myself to him do we really know so much about why it is we do what we do
6550427 its hard not to hate you for what you have done but youre right i need to look at things rationally sometimes were forced to do things by our circumstances not because we want to do them but because we must
6550428 so what youre saying is that if i married you to any woman i wouldnt be able to trust either of you not to betray me again
6550429 we fooled him too is that why we fooled them
6550430 i saved your life jael i deserve better than this
6550431 we have a job i did it i didnt take action against you i didnt put your wife at risk how is it that i have wronged you in this
6550432 i dont know enough about kerrn biology to know whether or not the idea of impotence gets through your skull i have a role to play in this i have something that she has given me to do and you have taken that from me
6550433 this human problem is something that thankfully we do not suffer from this castration fear you all carry around with you
6550434 i trusted you jael i thought we had an understanding
6550435 i thought we had an understanding too i thought we had an understanding that we would do whatever it took to protect the forged lord tell me wouldnt you do everything for her
6550436 i worked very well and i would appreciate your input as we reviewed the debriefings
6550437 jael why is cerelia coming to me complaining about how her brother is being treated
6550438 i did not tell you about this because it is not fair to talk about your husband without more proof but certain signs are present that pitr might be compromised
6550439 a brain scan a year keeps the world safe from fear
6550440 i suppose being shipped off is better than being married to leah
6550441 men dont seem to have much sense in terms of getting getting into marriages one way or another
6550442 michael how are you of all people telling me they should go off world
6550443 do you have anything to report you havent been reporting to jael i hear
6550444 how many husbands before me will you have michael avram now her
6550445 i run a bureaucracy pitr sometimes things get lost sometimes im as confined in iron as you are you need to help me figure out what the best place for you is
6550446 theres something you can do for me michaels gathering a secret army of mukhadish jael doesnt know about it
6550447 hope is a noble thing so long as you do not let it blind you to what is
6550448 dont pretend you have my best interests at heart she doesnt and neither do you
6550449 damn these mukhadish if only they worked how the books said
6550450 it will certainly make a name for you if you succeed
6550451 ew no i am not dating michael phelps i have never ever in my life hooked up with michael phelps i have really good taste hes not really my type personally to tell you the truth we dont even talk to each other
6550452 my private life is my private life i have to keep something private you guys know everything else
6550453 the wheel spins out of control fire blazes everywhere those would ride this wheel beware
6550454 dont take this personally but thank the wheel youre not the archcotare
6550455 jael has always served you faithfully tell me do you think of her more as a husband or a daughter
6550456 i think were too much alike to be good friends but i think we can come to some understanding
6550457 one from the outer world coming at a time of great crisis who would be tested by fire
6550458 a connection between the pirates and the ancestor cult i knew it
6550459 is that really what you think he came to talk to me about
6550460 i wont have you stealing the rest of my family daniel
6550461 it is this disorder where the human feels his penis is retreating to his body
6550462 have you noticed if pitr has a problem with his penis
6550463 tay when you were working with the pirates did you ever meet elizabeths son
6550464 i dont want hearing whats said between me and my mother its just a matter of piety
6550465 it is too important to her to her rule to just cast aside
6550466 i have concessions you will increase the security at your familys harvesting operations
6550467 jael it is our place to advise it is hers to rule
6550468 how how are you sure again when your advice is wrong because she knows it it wrong how are you sure enough to advise her again
6550469 a very wise man once told me if youre dumb surround yourself with smart people and if youre smart surround yourself with smart people who disagree with you the truth is like a slippery fish it is hard for any one person to hold on to it we make our choices we advise her as best we can by the mere fact that she continues to ask our opinion we know that they are worth listening to we are not the smart people surrounding the dumb one
6550470 at the end of the day even if they disagree theres still this other level of interaction
6550471 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
6550472 those who do not know their place on the wheel will be crushed beneath it
6550473 ive long considered the church the greatest threat to my power
6550474 its not just him i need to find a way blind all of the other eyes with my walls
6550475 did i teach you nothing we are always watched there is no place we can escape the eyes of those who wish us harm
6550476 if you were going to put a spy in my security service how would you do it
6550477 i will heal a man for her but i will not torture one
6550478 do you have any idea what your life is going to look like from now on
6550479 its only when we know what we have to lose that we can truly understand what matters what got us here and what keeps us alive are two different things
6550480 and i know that i can lose anything and ultimately who am is not tied up in that man
6550481 perhaps youre right maybe i was wrong maybe this wasnt a personal matter maybe this is about survival
6550482 i would like to send a big get well to my friend censored because if you think im bad you ought to see him
6550483 the reason i keep you by my side is your paranoia
6550484 i see from the ancestors you brought that you value the bonds of marriage thats what hold us and our planet together
6550485 technically this will be easier if i have your permission
6550486 so youre willing to let him back into your life you know thats a risk
6550487 jael usually doesnt let people who betray you back in the building
6550488 these men that you marry they trust you are at their most vulnerable with you are they not
6550489 it is a hard thing when you have a child that betrays you disappoints you
6550490 flesh of my flesh you know we kerrn we bud flesh of our flesh indeed the fazzia it grows from him you watch it develop sometimes there is the bad bud though you know they do not do what they are told they go off they hide in places on the omship i have seen it happen even in the students in my yeshiva you look and they day by day they have slipped away you know they are fermenting biologically active compounds suddenly you do not know them the fazzia they come and they do not know this thing they have made this thing that they thought was like them and what you do then it is a very hard thing sometimes you sends them to become solzaja the displine it molds you sometimes i suspect so it was with jael but sometimes you must do hard things sometimes you must treat them sternly you cannot let your feelings for a bud threaten the omshiip i know that you will do what is right you world means so much to you
6550491 he is no better than a plant he cannot rise above what he is
6550492 they think we are traitors we speak for their dead we have given many of our number so they may speak with those who have gone to the sea
6550493 i want him returned loyal to me and want all the details of his treachery
6550494 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
6550495 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
6550496 i cannot recommend a site any more than this one
6550497 he is absolute in his justice seeking beautifully informational staunchly analytical and a joy to behold i consider it both a duty and a delight to keep coming back here

6550503 what exactly do these oppositions prefects have against their grandmothers anyways

6550511 governmental encouragement does not order men to believe that the false is true it merely makes them indifferent to the issue of truth or falsehood
6550512 it includes energy rebates of 1 000 for more than 5 million michigan workers and their families and 1 7 billion dollars to keep michigans essential state and local government services running
6550513 in addition to this immediate relief i will as president also provide a middle class tax cut that is three times larger than the one my opponent offers putting a 1 000 tax cut directly into the pockets of 95 of workers and their families and i will end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create good paying jobs here in america
6550514 that starts with solving our energy crisis once and for all this isnt just a challenge to meet its an opportunity to seize freudian slip me an opportunity that will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs that pay well and cant be outsourced
6550515 to do this well invest 150 billion over the next ten years and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates 5 million new american jobs
6550516 well leverage private sector funding to bring these cars directly to american consumers and well give consumers a 7 000 tax credit to buy these vehicles thats how well get one million 150 m p g hybrids on our roads within six years thats how well not only protect our auto industry and our auto workers but help them thrive in a 21st century economy and that is how we will finally lower gas prices secure our energy future and save this planet for our children
6550517 i went to jail as an infant and i had to learn how to walk by watching other people in jail along with old reruns of the jeffersons
6550518 we have so many sprinters in jamaica its crazy this has been the jamaican olympics
6550519 lightning bolt and more of his trademark theatrics his exuberant 100m victory celebrations begun before he crossed the line were criticised by some as excessive and unsporting
6550520 undertakings given at the 2007 forum in tonga to hold an election by march 2009
6550521 for the first time this pacific islands forum has condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honour his undertakings to the pacific island leaders a year or so ago
6550522 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6550523 will all great neptunes ocean wash this blood clean from my hand no this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine making the green one red
6550524 i would expect the view from your own balcony to be better
6550525 the first report to integrate point of sale pos data for video game software sales in the worlds largest games markets
6550526 the video games business has become increasingly global with the majority of the publishers releasing games in multiple markets
6550527 the u s as the worlds largest market will be able to view and compare sales for the first time outside of their own market
6550528 we are excited to be working more closely with npd and enterbrain
6550529 this partnership represents a great opportunity to benefit not only our clients but the industry as a whole by providing a comprehensive industry supported view of sales across the three largest video game markets
6550530 we are very grateful to start such a valuable service and alliance with npd and gfk chart track limited
6550531 this service gives us the ability to better help game publishers and developers by providing them with a more global view of market performance
6550532 although the pass through from producer to consumer price inflation is unstable this will still have the hawks at the fed remain on inflation alert
6550533 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6550534 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year
6550535 we havent seen those prices reflected in the finished products yet
6550536 i didnt have anything left i dont know what to say
6550537 the clcapsvc driver module has stopped working i gather that is the module for closed caption service in other oses you just cant turn cc off with the vista tv update pack 2008 it crashes and tv enhance wont work at all
6550538 the reality is that water quality in the region has been declining so keeping stock out of rivers and streams is an essential part of reversing this trend
6550539 its easier to protect clean water near the start of rivers and streams than deal with dirty water in the lower reaches of waterways
6550540 i dont understand why wont you let me see my father
6550541 like you didnt trust me maybe you could send him to the moon
6550542 what do you want me to do stop selling them grain or poison it
6550543 they dont all know that youve turned yet i say we insinuate ourselves deeper i presume it wont be too much of a burden on you to pretend disloyalty to me
6550544 i owe your mother the loyalty of a daughter but i dont owe you the loyalty of a sister
6550545 you hate the muhkadish dont you doesnt it grate on you that she goes and listens to them
6550546 she wanted you for what you did to her but then she saw that you were merely the knife not the hand that holds it she has grand ambitions i spoke with her once she is a driven and dangerous woman she rejects the teachings of the church she sees the wheel as slavery she would break the chains of this world but i sensed in her a tiredness a sense that perhaps time had passed her by perhaps this world no longer had room for her perhaps shed grown to big for it perhaps she was like the fish that when it grows too large and too old is nibbled to death by its children perhaps she could sense her children coming for her children she has a daughter in the church
6550547 shes outwitted me again first she gives my son back to me and now she gives this other man
6550548 we thought you should know theres a possibility of a spy in your ranks
6550549 i know we disagree about many things brother but can we not agree that this is an abomination
6550550 its obvious what they were aiming at do you understand why you realize the face of politics on this world relies on the negotiations between our families between our long lived clans and our ancestors and that the easiest way for the church to regain power is to destroy the political bonds that everyone else works to ensure they cant
6550551 would you not have the same ancestors without these muhkadish to speak for them
6550552 if you cant bring your ancestors to the table and they have no voice then how can you possibly form bonds with them
6550553 come you must know what they are like as i know about my motha and my mothas motha all the way back to the kerrn who stood before the emperor i can speak for them without any alien to speak for me
6550554 you were there when we welcomed makeda youve seen that happen a millions times explain to me how we could have done that where it would have had that sort of effect on her on us where it would have affirmed those bonds without
6550555 you know i havent seen what goes on in that chamber i see what happens afterward but what they say there
6550556 they say the same thing as if you loaded a brain tape on you computer i suppose thats not the point the point is that the church is trying to take away one of my most valuable political tools and theyre trying to do it through the realm of doctrine which is how they always do it
6550557 well can you not as they say each two fish with one gulp what if you did use a computer
6550558 the palpible prescence of our ancestors is what gives them their power
6550559 this is what i was born to she abandoned me to it i have no bond with her i owe her nothing tell me what to do
6550560 for too long the church has remained silent and allowed these dead voices to speak and to be heard i know that many of you long for the touch for those voices of those you held dear those who have left us those who have gone to the sea but we must not we cannot we shall not let the living be controlled by the dead
6550561 i dont think anybody really impresses me on our offense but the offense is going to be alright theyve got a lot of athletes and a lot of great players too but im not going to give them any pub because were a defensive football team
6550562 usc fans can be overly enthusiastic about their team at times
6550563 this system was established in 1988 and i think we should not leave alter this system
6550564 the fifa world cup could not be repeated because the players are not available
6550565 this was the arrangement we made with the olympic movement and so far the ioc is happy and especially the organisers of the olympic games
6550566 good i can just buy a 790i ftw and a penryn and be on my way
6550567 uno lo que tiene que valorar es el bienestar del menor y si lo va a encontrar en una familia que no es de la provincia realizando el tr mite correspondiente creo que no debe haber problema
6550568 se cree que habr a colegas abogados involucrados pero no tenemos pruebas para demostrarlo
6550569 hablar de adopciones ilegales no es lo correcto porque en realidad la adopci n es un tr mite donde intervienen abogados y sobre todo el juez que aqu en misiones es muy cauteloso en cuanto a la tramitaci n y el resguardo de dar en adopci n a un chico
6550570 esto lo hacen personas que no necesariamente tienen que ser profesionales del derecho ni de la salud sino que tambi n hay quienes se aprovechan del grado de necesidad de personas que no puedan educar y ni criar a sus hijos
6550571 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6550572 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6550573 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6550574 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6550575 radioactive waste is a big problem facing the united states and the entire world
6550576 we need new innovative technology and i think supercritical fluid is one such technology that will play an important role in the very near future
6550577 there is no solvent used and so no solvent left behind
6550578 this agreement and technology is something idaho should be very proud of
6550579 we have developed something special and to me that something is important to idaho and to the u s particularly as we look for alternate energy sources in the future
6550580 this process has been extremely one of those that you just love
6550581 its going to be a great deal that will benefit the university of idaho areva and the entire world
6550582 to me accomplishing that is important to idaho and to the united states particularly as we look for alternate energy sources in the future
6550583 i believe nuclear energy will play a very large role and that it can be done in a very environmentally safe and sustainable way
6550584 stephen a man full of gods grace and power performed amazing miracles and signs among the people
6550585 to this you were called because christ suffered for you leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps
6550586 because of nikkis fund more usd students are seeking help for depression and have access to preventative programs when it comes to suicidal ideation
6550587 suicide claims the lives of 30 000 people each year thats a staggering number especially because it can be prevented
6550588 its very important that our students know that through nikkis fund and the student counseling center usd is committed to suicide prevention and raising awareness in order to let students know that help is here for them
6550589 the deposit could be one of the most important in south america in the last 60 years
6550590 the find is one of the most spectacular and scientifically interesting discoveries of the last decade
6550591 i did say that ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6550592 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6550593 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6550594 life group helped me to want to read my bible more so that i could share scriptures that we discussed i grew up in a christian home but as an adult stopped reading my bible life group made me want to read it again so that i could show people exactly what i was talking about when we discussed topics
6550595 it seems like we only started going and it ended looking forward to building relationships over the summer
6550596 i really just appreciate lauren soto so much she was always very welcoming and she was so honest and open about her own life it was remarkable i always felt accepted and loved in her presence she really was a great choice for a leader
6550597 i loved the questions that went with the sunday series it gave us focus and helped solidify what we heard at church the week before
6550598 this was a really great experience i wasnt sure if i would be able to open up because i am sometimes shy but the group made it so interesting and everyone was so open that the conversation just flowed and we all just bounced off of each other i cant wait for the next group in the fall
6550599 i found friends that really care about me and their relationship with god i have been able to have so many questions answered and they have been a great support and encouragement to me in my walk tim and ryan are terrific leaders they both immediately reached out to me when i joined the group and made me feel really comfortable i am really grateful that god put me in this group
6550600 it makes my life easier if i source good products i dont have to try as hard to make things taste good
6550601 people these days are much more savvy about what they put in their bodies
6550602 oh we are satirizing the risible stereotyping that is going on and we are a small tiny little magazine anyway
6550603 overall i think its good to talk to people about what is going on
6550604 its human nature people are scared of the other and we are the other people are scared to know us its amazing how little we know about each other
6550605 it is about people that often face prejudices in the community or find it hard to be accepted and they want to show that they are worthwhile
6550606 immer erst ein projekt mit inhalt f llen und nicht gleich im anfangsstadium damit in gro en communities werben
6550607 four attacks in two days ships being hijacked and crews being taken and large ransoms being demanded is completely unacceptable
6550608 this is the worst number of attacks that we have seen in a short period of time for years
6550609 give piracy a much higher priority to bring this under control there have been seven vessels hijacked since the 20th of july

6550770 an allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim pursuant to section 5 12 f of the dmca
6550771 t he dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice indeed it would be impossible to meet any of the requirements of section 512 f without doing so a consideration of the fair use doctrine is simply part of that initial review

6550799 carry on vaccinating until we find out why vaccines are killing cats and which cats are most likely to die
6550800 examples are the encephalitides following measles chickenpox rubella smallpox vaccination vaccinia and many other less well defined viral infections
6550801 our ongoing studies of dogs show that following routine vaccination there is a significant rise in the level of antibodies dogs produce against their own tissues some of these antibodies have been shown to target the thyroid gland connective tissue such as that found in the valves of the heart red blood cells dna etc i do believe that the heart conditions in cavalier king charles spaniels could be the end result of repeated immunizations by vaccine s containing tissue culture contaminants that cause a progressive immune response directed at connective tissue in the heart valves the clinical manifestations would be more pronounced in dogs that have a genetic predisposition the findings should be generally applicable to all dogs regardless of their breed

6550859 when a republican wears a little american flag lapel pin what is he trying to say
6550860 why did the vietnamese shoot down john mccain and put him in prison for five years he seems like such a nice guy
6550861 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
6550862 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
6550863 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish
6550864 mainstream media is going to ask john mccain that question
6550865 because johns father was the naval commander in the pacific theater he was exploited with tv interviews while wounded
6550866 i can verify that john has an infamous reputation for being a hot head he has a quick and explosive temper that many have experienced first hand folks quite honestly that is not the finger i want next to that red button

6550893 using a four bit microcontroller i would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness from snow white to coal black the program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16 element table of initial timer values then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table at the end of the time delay it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast come back next week and ill show you a working prototype
6550894 toasters dont just turn bread into toast they are also used to warm frozen waffles what you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker as the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated they will demand more capabilities they will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage fry bacon and make scrambled eggs a toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete if we dont look to the future we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years
6550895 with this in mind we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem first create a class of breakfast foods specialize this class into subclasses grains pork and poultry the specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast muffins pancakes and waffles pork divided into sausage links and bacon and poultry divided into scrambled eggs hard boiled eggs poached eggs fried eggs and various omelet classes
6550896 the ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork dairy and poultry classes thus we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance at run time the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says cook yourself the semantics of this message depend of course on the kind of object so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs
6550897 reviewing the process so far we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food in the design phase we have discovered some derived requirements specifically we need an object oriented language with multiple inheritance of course users dont want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying so concurrent processing is required too
6550898 we must not forget the user interface the lever that lowers the food lacks versatility and the darkness knob is confusing users wont buy the product unless it has a user friendly graphical interface when the breakfast cooker is plugged in users should see a cowboy boot on the screen users click on it and the message booting unix v 8 3 appears on the screen unix 8 3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook
6550899 having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase an intel 80386 with 8mb of memory a 30mb hard disk and a vga monitor should be sufficient if you select a multitasking object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built in gui writing the program will be a snap imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware first design strategy to lock us into a four bit microcontroller

6550913 theres no secret drama to his personality therere no wunderkind tantrums
6550914 part of it is just that adrians a chicago guy
6550915 he grew up there and its the only place in the world that he wants to be its the best city in the world in his eyes
6550916 that says a lot about him and his motivations we didnt consciously say were not gonna do a bay area start up but that was an extension of adrians personality to set this up a little bit off the radar
6550917 he was doing something almost nobody else was doing and he was doing it better than anybody else was doing
6550918 when this gets built maybe hell want to go back to having a salary
6550919 hes one of those web rock stars who would never let himself get much of a head you say anything sort of nice about him he kind of shrugs and looks down he doesnt take compliments all that well

6550927 my biggest goal when i worked with adrian in lawrence was to keep the bureaucracy and all the crap away from him and to give him as little direction as possible
6550928 he can be doing this stuff and hell wink at you
6550929 you can see the wink like in the congressional database you could search by members astrological sign thats classic adrian dont you think thats funny i love that
6550930 i dont like doing trendy things just because theyre trendy im like the anti buzz anti trendiness startup its not in silicon valley its not using venture capital its not hitting all the buzzwords

6550936 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6550937 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6550938 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old

6550944 we are excited to initiate the first pku patient registry and believe that it will substantially strengthen the available data on a variety of pku patient populations including some less studied such as children under four years of age and maternal pku patients
6550945 approximately half of the pku clinics have already expressed interest in participating in the registry program
6550946 moreover at a very minimal cost to biomarin we will be able to bypass the current two to eight week processing time between bpps referral and initiation of commercial therapy by providing an initial supply of kuvan at no cost to patients this will allow physicians to test for responsiveness to kuvan without the need to first secure insurance coverage we have also received numerous requests to support pku clinics planning patient information days to further stimulate interest in kuvan screening and we are pleased to help advance education in the pku community

6550985 over and over a catalog of hand drawn patterns collects groundbreaking work from fifty of todays most talented designers who create patterns by hand and use them in their work in inventive and innovative ways from deanne cheuks patterns that adorn current fashion to those of robin cameron that explore her interest in art to garrett morins patterns that arose from an exercise for a character called eloie the examples in this book push the boundaries of the traditional concept of what a pattern is the selected works are often not an end result but the beginning of something else of something bigger and broader while the computer is sometimes involved in the production of patterns the hand drawn element is always evident in the uniqueness of these works featuring more than 250 vibrant and exciting patterns over and over explores this magic on every single page and will inspire designers everywhere

6551016 it took a little getting used to with the change in leagues
6551017 i drew a bunch of walks at the beginning of the season they were pitching away a lot and once i showed them i could go away then they started coming back in its tough as going from low a to high a is a big jump here all the pitchers are experienced pro ballplayers and they dont really miss as much here as in low a you almost need to stay one step ahead of the team and pitcher you are playing each team has their different styles on how to attack hitters and you just try to change your plan accordingly it takes a little getting used to but in the big leagues and triple a they are going to know exactly how to pitch you so when i get that far i have to know how to do that

6551059 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6551060 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
6551061 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
6551062 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river
6551063 al queda may carry out terrorist acts in new york paris madrid or london but it has its roots in afghanistan and it has to be wiped out at the roots
6551064 similarly french should support the fight against tamil tigers in sri lanka
6551065 the eu india us and canada have banned ltte as a terrorist organization together with taliban hence the all the countries should jointly fight terrorism
6551066 i see no difference in attacking taliban camps in afghanistan or attacking the bases of tamil tigers in kilinochchi
6551067 we are shocked to learn about the death of 10 french soldiers all democratic countries must get together in the fight against terrorism whether taliban terrorism or the terrorism unleashed by the tamil tigers
6551068 now the french citizens have begun to realize the danger of terrorism and i am sure their understanding of the sri lankas fight against ltte terror will grow gradually and the french government would take effective actions against fund raising and money laundering by the ltte and its front organizations like ort france
6551069 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognize that
6551070 in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it
6551071 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
6551072 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
6551073 after five months of digging and re digging to see what else they could obtain they had to return to the original allegations
6551074 i want to see people like me the real deal
6551075 im looking for character more than anything you could be the greatest musician in the world but if you stand in jeans and a evil beet gossip found this 82 minutes ago on
6551076 the phone will ring and itll be him nationwide on sanjayas side
6551077 reaching this milestone is a good indication that we are on a favorable trajectory as a business
6551078 we remain committed to focusing on our product sales containing operating costs keeping our customer service levels high and responding to customer and market needs this is one of many milestones we have set for ourselves we have come a long way but still have a long way to go as we continue to build the gigabeam business
6551079 this bill will end the practice of unwilled dead body trafficking
6551080 as an asian american i know that few people from my community would voluntarily donate their organs or bodies due to the strong cultural preference of leaving their body intact for burial after death
6551081 i am hopeful that the bill will receive the governors signature and the practice of unwilled body trafficking will be put to a halt
6551082 our volume is 600 up this presidential cycle 2008 to date versus 2004
6551083 however you must install windows sharepoint services 3 0 sp1 or later and office sharepoint server 2007 sp1 or later before you install sql server 2008
6551084 upgrade from sql server 2005 to 2008 is a pretty simple process
6551085 that said you can probably see up to 30 size reduction on your blob laden content databases and perhaps 90 95 on your other databases
6551086 should not be used to control sharepoints usage of sql
6551087 its great that people are able to marry each other whether you are gay or straight
6551088 i was really excited when i heard about it and the fact that they courtenay lands in cooler
6551089 this is the most complicated parachute test nasa has run since the 60s
6551090 we are taking a close look at what caused the set up chutes to malfunction a failure of set up parachutes is actually one of the most common occurrences in this sort of test
6551091 one woman said she really wanted to set her rowing machine so she could do the same number of strokes per minute as the olympic athletes
6551092 she was obviously sitting in front of her tv and entering into the spirit of it all
6551093 another caller wanted to adjust his exercise bike so he was cycling at the same number of miles per hour as the olympians
6551094 and even though the track and field events hadnt yet started people were also asking about settings for their jogging machines
6551095 with rowing and cycling machines if you cant keep up youll just go slowly but with jogging machines if you set them to the pinnacle of what its capable of doing and you cant keep up it could be dangerous
6551096 one of the reasons for london bidding for the 2012 olympics is that we know events like the olympics are aspirational and they make people want to take part
6551097 but there has to be a degree of realism and common sense about peoples ambitions
6551098 they have to be aware that the athletes they see on tv have a genetic endowment that means they can perform at the highest level and they have spent years dedicating themselves to improving their personal performance
6551099 for example runners in the womens marathon on sunday would reach speeds of 12 13mph
6551100 thats a phenomenal speed and most people wont be able to keep up with it for more than a few seconds let alone two hours
6551101 its great that people are being inspired by the games and the performances taking place across different sports but each individual needs to know their limits
6551102 olympic athletes have been in full time training for years and progressively work towards the standards they achieve
6551103 to avoid injuring yourself by overstretching setting smaller targets for performance improvements in your fitness regime would be the best start in improving your exercise rates whether thats on the rowing machine bike or on the treadmill
6551104 but i know that you want to see the cave dont you ill show you
6551105 its odd standing here in the same area where my ancestors were buried i felt really strange when i had the bones the skull of my great great great grandfather dating back 120 generations in my hands
6551106 i cant describe it the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end it wasnt exactly a nice feeling but it was an incredible experience that i wont ever forget the 3 000 year old bones are so far removed from our lives today and these 120 generations thats so long ago
6551107 we have no idea what happened during this time we dont know what happened to these people
6551108 it is a unique discovery while we were examining the prehistoric bones of the male individuals we found genetic patterns which are unique
6551109 we wanted to find out whether these genetic patterns were still present in the living population of this area so we put an advert in the local paper and we asked people to take part in our project 270 people came forward we were very surprised that so many wanted to help us
6551110 the local residents had to give a sample of saliva we extracted dna from the saliva and looked for the genetic patterns on the y chromosome in the end we found two men who have a very similar genetic pattern to the prehistoric one and that genetic pattern is unique
6551111 i saw the advert in the paper and i thought it was an interesting idea
6551112 they took a sample of saliva using cotton wool buds they put it in a plastic tube and then sealed it the scientists also had their mouths covered to prevent any mixing of the dna samples
6551113 i didnt expect it at all to end up being the direct descendant of the cavemen its amazing especially as on that particular day i had such a dry mouth i thought the dna sample wouldnt work
6551114 your appearance is determined by both parents by the mother and father we were investigating the y chromosome from father to son in our project its a modern phenomenon that we move around in the old days people normally lived and stayed in the same place where they were born
6551115 i definitely think the shape of the head is similar to the caveman but after 3 000 years and 120 generations im sure personalities have changed
6551116 initial applications to join the oss preliminary training and subsequent work assignments pay leave and travel documents evaluations basic medical information and awards decorations and discharge papers
6551117 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
6551118 i mean you cant help but to not forget about it because theyre always showing it on tv with brett favre and his retirement thing
6551119 the good thing about it is they dont show the end part but they show when he dropped back play action hes throwing it to the left and i know its me
6551120 im not going to say just that one particular play is motivating me to do different things im going to keep doing what i do it was just a play i got beat everybody in this league gets beat so ive just got to move on and just move forward
6551121 we do know she was at bagram for a long time it was a long time according to my client she was there for years and she was held in american custody her treatment was horrendous
6551122 we cant for the life of us work out why they do it
6551123 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
6551124 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behaviour
6551125 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
6551126 and allah has set forth an example for those who believe the wife of firawn when she said
6551127 firawn was the most tyrannical and disbelieving person on earth and by allah his disbelief did not affect his wife when she decided to obey her lord
6551128 firawns wife was tortured in the heat of the sun when her torturers would take a break and walk away the angels would shade her with their wings and she would see her home in paradise
6551129 firawns wife asked who won and it was said to her
6551130 look for the largest rock you can find if she sticks to what she said throw it on her if she retracts what she said she will remain my wife
6551131 my lord build for me a home with you in paradise
6551132 firawns wife believed because of the wife of firawns treasurer
6551133 the lord of me your father and everything is allah
6551134 yes the lord of you i and everything is allah and i worship him
6551135 i will kill your son if you do not do not go back from what you said
6551136 be happy my mother you have such and such reward with allah
6551137 my lord build for me a home with you in paradise
6551138 this is the scent of the woman who combed the hair of firawns daughter and her children

6551141 thats where i get my news except of course for the mercury news
6551142 how did you know my one problem with junk food is cheez its
6551143 my mother loved them and i have to stay away from them im not tempted by chocolates or anything sweet but i have to watch out
6551144 my brother and i used to watch all the shows and we had all the action figures growing up we used to dress up like the wrestlers for halloween so its something that weve always enjoyed watching
6551145 my guilty pleasure is ebay the most comprehensive museum ever imagined
6551146 i try to find at least one item there for each show just check out the 1960s rolodex file in our production of doubt center stage on sister aloysius desk i love the idea that the perfect detail is actually available somewhere and i can search the entire country to find it
6551147 on the weekend i like to let my hair down what little i have left of it
6551148 and just be a regular guy blend in with the crowd im a relaxed rider where you put your leather jacket on and sit back its definitely freedom you feel like its just you and the elements its refreshing
6551149 thats a secret pleasure for me i dont even know exactly why i like it so much except that is has dench and she could gargle and id love it
6551150 my foodie friends would not be pleased but whenever i need a little lift maybe every three months or so i eat an entire tub of frozen cool whip its soothing its cold and i love it
6551151 if i can hit the gym between 12 and 1 my guilty pleasure is to reward myself for sweating by watching the e news and then the daily ten on the e channel at least i can honestly say ive never watched it just sitting down
6551152 ill eat anything kraft macaroni amp cheese im old school i like the kind with the powder i also like liverwurst or fried bologna sandwiches because my dad used to make them hes german but honestly i am surrounded by the other stuff at work so when i get home i like to keep it simple
6551153 no not the unwanted messages you get in your e mail the spam luncheon meat that comes in the rectangular blue can i grew up eating it spam and eggs spam and rice spam musubi with sushi rice wrapped in seaweed i prefer not to create anything too complicated like the spam sandwiches suggested on its container id rather have pure unadulterated spam next time youre feeling a bit under the weather try this spam with macaroni peas and chicken broth yum
6551154 i love horror films not just because i crave the goose bump factor of a good evisceration but also because horror is one of the most metaphorically rich genres of the postmodern age
6551155 horror is an allegory for existence teeth takes a bite out of sexism in society the last winter fast forwards to the rising tide of global warming even the granddaddy of modern monster movies jaws indicts the pettiness of business interests determined to keep the beaches open no matter whats in the water horror intimately reflects who we are what we want and what scares the capri pants off us from hamlet to hostel horror is as fundamental to human existence as comedy and tragedy its like beckett only with disemboweling whats not to love
6551156 however you dont have nroff so theyre probably useless to you
6551157 when theres so much money involved with these major corporations wanting this space theres just no way for us to win
6551158 but if someone were to walk into a church next sunday and grab the mike out of the ministers hands and handcuff him that wouldnt be reasonable
6551159 what if it doesnt work well be up and running about 350 000 to 400 000 later
6551160 we are building a record to decide how best to proceed
6551161 theyre trying to get it passed right now because so much is about to change this white space thing is under the radar
6551162 but its not something that can be adopted in a year or six months
6551163 if the lord eternal could look down and see everything simultaneously what he would see from heaven is that over most of the u s over most of the week the white space isnt being used
6551164 its used in the broadway district of new york in the evenings in las vegas in the evenings and at megachurches on sunday morning
6551165 we can no longer justify operating manufacturing facilities at both the washington street and hankins road locations our current plans call for no reduction in the volume of units produced in twin falls but the efficiencies involved by consolidation will allow us to be more competitive in the marketplace
6551166 when i decided to stop smoking it was one of the biggest decisions of my life i had been smoking 20 a day for nearly 30 years i was an overweight smoke smelling 40 year old unable to change one or the other
6551167 stopping smoking has made me feel healthier so i have been able to exercise more and lose weight i decided to have a gastric bypass for my birthday this year but i wouldnt have been offered the surgery if i still smoked as the risks are too high
6551168 the conversations between defendant and the pastor are not protected by the privilege
6551169 this was a conversation between a defendant and his wifes pastor there was no spiritual component to the conversation it was designed to protect the two children
6551170 the communication has to be made in confidence to the clerics in the clerics role as a spiritual adviser
6551171 my wife and i we were talking inside and we just heard a loud noise
6551172 when we come out we just heard that children were crying so many kids they were crying and crying then we called 9 1 1
6551173 the traffic officer stated she was cited for running a stop sign and also cited for driving on a suspended license
6551174 i dont know that yet it would be on the report

6551187 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6551188 this government is determined to support veterans and ex service personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6551189 we are seeking to better identify those at risk common contributing factors in recent cases the incidence of suicide in the ex service community and whether there is more that government agencies and the medical and allied health professions can do to support veterans under stress
6551190 its gonna be an awesome party with more than seven things i like
6551191 its gonna be totally awesome i hope its a great time
6551192 for nemo producing al qaeda propaganda has become a way of life
6551193 he has compiled so much relevant ideological material and made it so widely available that thinking of him as a simple propagandist would be understating the contribution that hes made for groups like al qaeda
6551194 we expect to improve the distance as the effect and design of transmit receive antennas and circuitry improve

6551210 and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6551211 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6551212 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
6551213 i very much appreciate your depth of knowledge in the mortgage industry i originally heard you on your radio show being a natural skeptic i listened several times to your show and i read your book i then researched the yield spread premium amounts on my previous property acquisitions and refinances a total of eleven of them and since i didnt go through a bank thank goodness every single one of them showed an ysp amount
6551214 mr robert blake thank you for publishing the e mail virus explination on your website i received

6551221 woke up much of the town to the unremembered history of the building

6551223 we encourage citizens to submit a nomination for whatever they think is in danger of being lost in their communities

6551231 ive indicated to them my displeasure with the thought of a carbon tax and that if they were thinking about it i would fight it tooth and nail
6551232 i am certain that cbc ctv talk radio or other media outlets could be approached and would be receptive to hosting such a debate which i would like to have at the earliest opportunity
6551233 memory is probably going to be one of the last key areas that we tackle as an underutilized resource as we go after a modular compute fabric so we basically would have compute memory and i o bricks all scaling independently in a modular way and building a new system that is a composite architecture

6551242 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary
6551243 wood was involved in the robbery in this case because of his longstanding mental illness that allowed him to be easily manipulated by the principal actor daniel reneau
6551244 executing someone who didnt kill violates the most basic principles of justice
6551245 if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury
6551246 it is awkward and quite strange to see states force inmates to take medication so they can be killed but this is the hateful nature of our capital punishment system
6551247 it has very little to do with logic and certainly nothing to do with compassion
6551248 there is unanimity that sovereignty is at the heart of the political project were carrying that were defending that we want to promote fran ois legault included

6551299 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6551300 weve almost got it all cleaned up but weve got some issues to deal with thank god no one got hurt
6551301 our main priority was the fiestas at our lady of belen catholic church
6551302 we got word from the national weather service that a storm was coming and the fiestas was where there was the most concentration of people after the initial storm passed we made the decision to close it down because of a lighter storm coming in behind it
6551303 ive lived here all my life and i dont remember ever seeing golf ball sized hail
6551304 some of us stayed outside trying to put things away or in a safe position
6551305 at first i went to hide under the stage but i wasnt sure if they turned off the power so i ran under the tent we stayed there for about five minutes but once there was a break we ran into the parish hall people in the parish hall were praying
6551306 all in all the fiestas were big success for us
6551307 the main thing is that god helped us and nobody was hurt if they wouldnt have made that call to get everyone inside or even if it was 10 minutes later i think we would have lost some people
6551308 it was actually really quiet and as far as we know there were no major injuries
6551309 three or four witnesses said they saw a tornado touch down in the bosque area weve gone down there and there is damage some of the trees are uprooted
6551310 we started working sunday night and we havent stopped since were getting calls on everything for broken windows and windshields im still trying to return messages
6551311 we can take as many as we can but weve been very busy and the phone just keeps ringing and ringing
6551312 we began boarding them up that night and were in the process of cleaning everything up
6551313 it was a pretty slow night that night for us and we only had a couple of guests on that side of the building we were able to transfer those guests into other rooms actually one tenant slept through the whole thing
6551314 it broke my living room window and my bedroom window i was so scared and it was still coming when i got home the living room was full of hail inside
6551315 i dont remember what we were doing exactly but when it hit we got real busy quick
6551316 all of a sudden the glass was breaking and coming into the front and living room and the hail coming in
6551317 i was trying to stay safe and he was trying to hold towels over the windows
6551318 it was very scary i thought someone was throwing rocks at the house at first then it sounded like gunshots
6551319 as we were cleaning up outside we found four dead turtle doves out there
6551320 we made it to the end of the road before we had to turn around we were scared i thought the windows were going to break it was coming down so hard i told the boys to get on the floor and not to get up its awful because weve only had our truck six months and it just got rear ended and we just got out of the shop a couple of months ago
6551321 i couldnt go out of my house because it was coming down so hard
6551322 it was just pelting the house and the windows i looked out toward the front and one of the curtains was blowing and thats when i realized that all our windows were broken
6551323 it broke every window on the north side and took her roof off it looked liked someone got a machine gun and shot out her skirting
6551324 were still picking up glass the blinds were shredded into tiny pieces as if they were in a blender it is horrible
6551325 my daughter is fine but if she would have been home shed be dead
6551326 we were up at isleta and it was clear so we had no idea what was going on my son told me that the windows on the mobile home was busted out and that the house was leaking and the skylights are busted
6551327 the first thing we saw when we turned off the interstate was all the trees that were bare and the leaves everywhere
6551328 our driveway and yard was full of leaves and flooded i looked up and could see the skylights that were broken when we went around to the back of the mobile home we saw the skirting it looks like someone got a gun and shot right through it
6551329 there was a lot of dead pigeons on the roof
6551330 they were split in half just busted i guess they didnt have sense enough to fly away or take cover
6551331 it just blew out the window the dishes i had on the drain board and the sink were all shattered
6551332 clear the air talks have taken place it was a positive discussion and we will now move forward together
6551333 officially im on my last year of my contract ive had preliminary talks and theres been interest from elsewhere
6551334 if i could dream at all it would be about you and im not ashamed of it

6551345 this is the first government report to present definitive conclusions that number one tobacco advertising and promotion are causally related to increased tobacco use in the population
6551346 and number two it shows that depictions of smoking in movies is causally related to youth smoking initiation
6551347 if you actually look at the details these are centrist not left wing proposals the message that hell expand government is a misrepresentation obama talks about a much more balanced fiscal policy than the current administration and mccain does too to the extent that he talks about policy at all
6551348 theyre both running on a platform thatd be an improvement on our current administration but thats a pretty low standard this administration has been a dismal failure
6551349 hes not been running very hard on his policy proposals hes been running a soft campaign till now and mccain has been trying to paint him as a leftist and hes succeeding
6551350 im an obama supporter because i view him as a centrist
6551351 despite his personal failings clinton ran a pretty good government and a policy of fiscal restraint

6551361 we watched video on them and ive had success using that shot over wangs block
6551362 if you can get it up and over her and if you make a fast approach tian usually shes going to fade back a little further
6551363 what makes it difficult is the ball is a little heavier so you end up pushing it more than you want to i pushed a couple out of bounds which i wasnt happy about but i knew that shot would be available
6551364 were so focused on having a family now that we got this gold

6551374 well i call your 1 peter and raise you a 1 corinthians and an ephesians
6551375 my only point is that others who did the same but were not notable were not similarly treated or targeted by the defense in the palfrey litigation
6551376 to put it plainly these expenses are the result of some pretty unofficial activities
6551377 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6551378 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6551379 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6551380 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6551381 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines

6551387 our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our war
6551388 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6551389 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6551390 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6551391 you owe it to yourself if youre good at something to pursue it
6551392 other states have been very successful in these lawsuits we think we can be here whether its federal court or state court judges in other states have come down against the state and said the state had better act upon that
6551393 they do it with the jail they mandate everything else this is one aspect they have to look at because other courts in other states have done this
6551394 you cannot have a boycott of education the first day of school is so important to many many young people theyve been off school for 2 1 2 months if you tell them not to go to school that school district loses money you taxpayers lose money
6551395 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6551396 having reviewed the video we acknowledge that its inclusion in the take down notice was an error and the error however was completely unintentional
6551397 viacom has no alternative accept to repeatedly search the entire youtube library
6551398 and send take down notices this is a massive effort we have manually reviewed over 1 7 million clips on youtube and have identified more than 187 000 pirated clips of our copyrighted content in an effort of this scale some inadvertent error is inevitable
6551399 if that doesnt prove that viacom knew my film wasnt their material i dont know what can
6551400 universal said she infringed on her copyright and sent a take down notice she then has an opportunity to appeal to youtube counter notification remedy which is what she sought and the video was restored
6551401 the dmca streamlined the process but the law also tried to balance it

6551411 my car has been sitting for three months so it needed a little work
6551412 i wouldnt want that to become a mockery of itself
6551413 we may do it again if we feel like it but this time around we wanted people to focus on the music and not the spectacle
6551414 it felt good to be able to go back between then and now on tour and see the reception and acknowledgement of both records not just the first one it allowed us to sort of bear witness to our fans it felt like the bond with the fans solidified this time around
6551415 we have a pretty diversified portfolio but i do believe thats a first for us
6551416 more than just trying to do something new we were trying to do things we didnt get to completely do on the first record
6551417 we went in with a lot more self awareness and certainty this time we knew what we were doing
6551418 its not something thats very introspective its usually a reenactment of whatever experience im addressing its something i survived or something that rings true to me as a common experience its never so personal that it cant pertain to someone elses life if its about pain ultimately pain is pain to everyone
6551419 that was unconscionable to do we didnt even try i think people wouldve been disappointed if we had people might initially miss that theres not a big hit record on there like crazy but if there was any failed attempt at that magnitude of a song again it wouldve spoiled an otherwise solid album
6551420 i was so used to moderacy over my 15 year career so it was surprising
6551421 but at the same time i was poised for it by that point i did feel like it was well earned and deserved and instead of causing me to be frantic or panicked i could be more like steel and just bask in the moment of it
6551422 i was misquoted once saying i didnt like billys version
6551423 i always try to correct that i grew up to billy idol he was like the first image of a true rock star to me in my life i loved billy idol so actually i was very proud of that

6551438 we cant go back and put women in big old heavy sweatshirts
6551439 you cant be a one dimensional player a lot of one dimensional players will leave a lot faster than the guy who can do a lot of different things
6551440 i can run i can catch and i can block i think thats the reason why the broncos brought me over here
6551441 im not a natural fullback but at the same time im stronger than most fullbacks
6551442 physically i go in there and i can slam into a linebacker but im really a runner thats what i do coming out of the backfield and catch some balls
6551443 but ill do whatever my coaches ask me to do i wont complain about it ill just go out there and just do my job pound for pound im probably one of the strongest guys on the team
6551444 fullbacks are usually slower they take longer to read pittman flies right in there he hits whoever
6551445 thats my type i like somebody thats just going to go all out
6551446 its just an adjustment for me its just another step in my career this is my 11th year and im excited to do a lot of new things so like i said if the coach asks me to do it i just go out there and i have fun doing it
6551447 i really dont like lead blocking too much but i go in there and ill do it just catching passes its a mismatch me against a linebacker 1 on 1 i can really take advantage of a linebacker
6551448 and physically thats a mismatch too because physically they cant cover me so theres a lot of things i can bring to the table in the passing game so i will say just really coming out of the backfield
6551449 more specific about what we want to do this game than long term
6551450 we need more playing time to come together as a team
6551451 once the games start everybody gets that lather going and youre ready to go out there and play
6551452 i just like to compete man and whatever happens happens
6551453 im learning the defense and im playing without thinking right now so thats the best thing
6551454 is the one guy that definitely wont play a full three quarters he looks good hes fine
6551455 real life goes on its not just about the building and the redskins and here we go and now were playing the it really is about the real life situations and theyre hard
6551456 but the one thing is we have a real tight family in the building when you lose a member it obviously hurts a lot more when youre tight knit but you also know youve got a lot of people around to support you
6551457 he has been very strong very real about this situation
6551458 the conversations hes had with my coaches have been very upbeat talking about the little victories each day each day he has considered a real blessing that his daughter has been alive to communicate with him and her mom i could see the pride he had in how his daughter was fighting this illness thats what came through these last couple of weeks
6551459 it really took my breath away when i saw the message come across my desk
6551460 i just stopped and immediately thought about all the times that we played against each other we didnt like each other when we played against each other but he was a tremendous athlete a tremendous leader he made a very deep mark in the history of the nfl and hell be greatly missed
6551461 i think we are urged within our hearts to press on
6551462 and grit our teeth a little bit and bear down when these things happen
6551463 he just didnt quite give me the full speed that i needed to see
6551464 vou conversar com o presidente luiz estev o porque n o estou feliz no brasiliense da minha parte n o pretendo continuar isso uma decis o pessoal e n o tem a ver com propostas de outros clubes
6551465 estou disposi o da equipe vou continuar meu treinamento e se precisarem de mim vou pro jogo enquanto estive fora soube que alguns times me procuraram mas n o sei quais tamb m soube do interesse da traffic
6551466 the bottom line is they played better ball than we did today
6551467 we made some errors at the end as well and they deserved to win
6551468 i dont know what happened im not every hitter so i know at the plate we struggled our pitching wasnt on point like it used to be but you know what we came out here and gave it everything we had left
6551469 i really kind of feel people will get off our back and realize there is some parity in this game
6551470 because ive always felt that the rest of the world is getting better
6551471 esperamos vencer fora de casa para engrenar na competi o n s respeitamos o coritiba que est vindo muito bem mas vamos para l buscar a vit ria

6551473 we made strides by signing different players to long term deals we just signed joffrey lupul jeff carters here for a couple of years and the players we have everyone gets along so the dressing rooms doing well i think were just going to evolve as a team as we get older
6551474 we made good strides last year in the playoffs and hopefully we can just move forward from there
6551475 well the best laid plans do not always work out the way you think and it is what you do when they do not work out that defines you

6551492 the first thing that came to mind was that i may have a cancer or leukemia
6551493 they may hear that aspirin may be beneficial for them or they be specifically be recommended it by their physician so they may be taking combinations of things that may lead to likelihood to have a bruise so all in all its not uncommon to happen
6551494 the buffer between your skin and your blood vessel may become thinner as well so your likelihood to have a bruise would increase as you age

6551496 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6551497 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6551498 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school

6551502 it was unfortunate that reggie was out but it gave sloan some good work because this could happen during the regular season
6551503 our middle linebacker doesnt have to be the greatest athlete but he has to have toughness and iq
6551504 that wasnt good but i think i proved i can play if reggie ever goes down
6551505 i was getting reps with the first team and second team instead of watching film of someone else playing out there i was seeing everything it first hand you learn more when you play
6551506 one being a growing interest in advertising plays that capitalize on indias emerging infrastructure and growing internet usage the other being an increase in second round deals
6551507 while the size of venture deals in the u s europe and even china continues to climb venture capitalists have shown some restraint in terms of investments in india due largely to the risk still associated with this emerging region
6551508 hopefully it wont linger and hopefully in the next week to 10 days hes going to be all right and ready to get going

6551535 there is a big issue about how you move athletes around
6551536 had it been us staging the games i dont think we would necessarily have done the switcheroo with the girl with the braces
6551537 we understand that people are keen to quantify the support the shareholders will offer on top of the equity they already have in the company
6551538 however it would be inappropriate to pre empt this while the company follows through due process with the trustees and their advisers
6551539 will have tens of millions of dollars more from them supporting the business as we go through the recovery plan
6551540 meaning that debenture investors get paid out before any of this money is accessible to shareholders

6551570 the fall in registrations from eastern europe is welcome news for our hard pressed public services but other government statistics publishes today show that immigration as a whole continues on a rising trend
6551571 even though the events took place so long ago that there is no likely reason that their disclosure could cause competitive damage
6551572 litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them
6551573 the federal reserve system virtually controls the nations monetary system yet it is accountable to no one it has no budget it is subject to no audit and no congressional committee knows of or can truly supervise its operations
6551574 money is simply another name for the most generally accepted medium of exchange
6551575 and was later transported to the early american colonies it formed the root of the american commercial banking and ultimately the federal reserve system
6551576 every major war has involved a departure from the gold standard because the gold standard put strict limits on government financing
6551577 if the american people got wind of the fact that this bank was not in their interests there would have been hell to pay
6551578 its no coincidence that the federal reserve system was established by the wilson administration this was a time of tremendous government expansion of special interest deals in washington
6551579 in order to get back to a market determined money the fed has to be abolished
6551580 run the risk of undermining market confidence in the fed
6551581 since 1980 the fed has enjoyed the absolute power to do literally anything it wants to buy not only us government securities but any asset whatever to buy as many assets and to inflate credit as much as it pleases there are no restraints on the federal reserve the fed is master of all it controls
6551582 give me control over a nations currency and i care not who makes its laws
6551583 the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender
6551584 history records that the money changers have used every form of abuse intrigue deceit and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and its issuance
6551585 i sincerely believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies already they have raised up a money aristocracy that has set the government at defiance the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
6551586 the money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity it is more despotic than a monarch more insolent than autocracy and more selfish than a bureaucracy it denounces as public enemies all who question its methods or throw light upon its crimes i have two great enemies the southern army in front of me and the bankers in the rear of the two the one at the rear is my greatest foe
6551587 we fully appreciate and share your concern about the potential civil liberties implications of the consolidated guidelines

6551589 subject to torture during his detention by or on behalf of the united states
6551590 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when binyam mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan in the period april 2002 until at least may 17 2002 when he was seen by an officer of the security service
6551591 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered

6551599 so everything that came out about marion was pretty devastating on a personal level
6551600 what she had accomplished meant a lot to me i still had a little bit of hope left when she started denying it then when everything finally came out i finally knew the whole truth now when anyone runs a phenomenal time it is questioned its really unfortunate

6551604 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan
6551605 without that information bm mohamed will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces given the confessions made by him in bagram and guant namo bay in 2004
6551606 it is a longstanding principle of the common law that confessions obtained under torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used in evidence in trial
6551607 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6551608 subject to torture during his detention by or on behalf of the united states
6551609 the court finds on the basis that what was done was arguably wrongdoing the british security service facilitated it
6551610 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6551611 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law we can only hope that the foreign secretary will now reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team
6551612 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered
6551613 the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guant namo bay and return him home to britain
6551614 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily

6551726 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6551727 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6551728 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place
6551729 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6551730 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns
6551731 to put somebody in the white house who says i dont know much about the economy thats whats risky
6551732 does a guy who made more than four million dollars last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6551733 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6551734 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6551735 if this doesnt make people forgive me and stop talking about all that i dont know what will
6551736 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july
6551737 clear the way conceivably for another round of ministerial engagement

6551740 my training before was a little choppy didnt really have any direction so having a training plans structure keeps you responsible and its efficient because you can go online and see your progress
6551741 the marijuana and the small bag of cocaine to take away the pain from cancer
6551742 dont you think youd be embarrassed to have your grandchildren know that youre in jail for buying drugs
6551743 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
6551744 the college of idaho is known locally and regionally as a high quality liberal arts college and we are pleased to receive national recognition
6551745 these rankings indicate that we are comparable to better known and more expensive liberal arts colleges in our region and certainly much higher ranked than the big regional institutions
6551746 for too many years information about the quality of american higher education has been monopolized by one publication u s news amp world report
6551747 the emphasis in this ranking system is on the college experience and post college experience including recognition in whos who faculty student interaction four year graduation rates national recognition such as rhodes marshall and goldwater scholarships and debt at graduation
6551748 it does not include what students bring to their college or university experience such as act or sat scores

6551755 but widespread 1 inch amounts are necessary to alleviate dryness with 2 inches ideal
6551756 most of the anticipated rainfall for the coming week will be less than ongoing drying loss for the same period and therefore evoke little or no change in the total soil condition

6551758 crude palm oil prices have fallen from highs of 1 200 a metric ton earlier this year to current levels of around 850 ton now so the government will adjust the tax rate accordingly
6551759 weve seen it fall a long way and the rally in the petroleum market lends a bullish sentiment to the natural gas market
6551760 it clearly demonstrates that we are getting a lot of new supplies in the market
6551761 even with warmer temperature anomalies we are not getting significant cooling demand
6551762 the republican party has never ever contacted me theyve never talked to me never written to me never communicated in any fashion just what you have said

6551764 the united states i think has shown great flexibility i think the iraqis have shown great flexibility
6551765 and this will be an excellent agreement when we finally have agreement
6551766 that would essentially fully reverse the strategy that the u s has been adopting under the surge where small groups of soldiers live in so called combat outposts among the communities in iraq
6551767 by next june u s troops would essentially withdraw to their bases and act in a support role
6551768 if security deteriorates and the iraqis want the u s to stay longer they could
6551769 the u s has already said that they are happy with whats been hammered out so approval by president bush is pretty much a given it seems
6551770 we know from past experience things can get stuck at any stage in that process
6551771 the united states has been pretty adamant that they do not want american soldiers to have to face trial in an iraqi court
6551772 the iraqis have been equally adamant that they want to have some accountability for the actions of u s troops here
6551773 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in the status of forces agreement
6551774 we are trying to put together an agreement that protects our people that respects iraqi sovereignty that allows us to lay the kind of foundation that we need for making certain that we complete the work weve all sacrificed so greatly to see accomplished
6551775 really we are very very close to closing this agreement and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6551776 time is of the essence but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion

6551779 we wanted to win the first half and the second half and we did that tonight i made it a challenge to the guys to get more opportunities by getting second and third options and follow up shots and we scored three goals tonight from follow ups
6551780 i was proud of the way our guys bounced back right after that goal
6551781 they responded in a positive manner and scored just a few minutes after that
6551782 the one guy who i thought was very unselfish tonight was boutin
6551783 he came off the bench and didnt score any goals but he made two goals happen he created many opportunities for us

6551790 exchange banks top executive j barrie graham resigned unexpectedly as president and chief executive officer of sonoma countys oldest and largest commercial bank exchange bank has long been a key lender for local builders but the real estate slump hit builders hard and exchange bank has felt the blows
6551791 i always like to say were intelligent risk takers that may prove to be wrong now said exchange banks veteran chairman c william reinking
6551792 it tells you a higher percentage of their loans are involved in construction
6551793 bank officials defended their lending standards and the decision to expand into the sacramento area the speed at which this thing fell apart was just unheard of reinking said

6551797 work with your lender dont wait be persistent lenders are overwhelmed with the number of people out there that are in foreclosure that are in desperate and dire situations if they say theyre going to call you and they dont do it call them continue to follow up said cathy warshawsky with the silicon valley california association of mortgage brokers
6551798 this is the first foreclosure prevention fair put on by the city of san jose but it likely wont be the last the nights high turnout has prompted city officials to think about organizing another one
6551799 the average price of home deals closed in manteca has dropped 1 584 a week since july 21 what is happening now are most banks arent messing around with the pricing of foreclosures that they put on the market most are deliberately under pricing them to attract between 15 and 18 offers within a week of listing them
6551800 there were 42 price reductions in the week ending aug 11 as the group as a whole went from an original average of 299 052 down to 255 899 in the previous week ending aug 4 there were also 42 price reductions that groups average went from 246 373 down to 201 709 that is skewed quite a bit as most of the price reductions arent happening below 210 000 instead a number of country properties have seen reductions of 100 000 plus in the past two weeks
6551801 florsheim homes ceo joe anfuso has indicated such news is welcome as it is a clear sign that the market is correcting itself
6551802 he said there are 275 homes for sale at this time in the lake almanor basin continuing he said 29 homes were sold between january 2008 and now 55 homes were sold during the same period in 2007
6551803 responding to general questions sabelman said the median price of sales outside chester ranged from 420 000 520 000
6551804 last winter was very tough on association members we have 200 realtor members in plumas county and probably 60 70 in our area who are fighting to keep their heads above water he said
6551805 home sales in monterey county continue to rise while the median price of sales continues its downward trend according to a real estate research firm compared to july 2007 the number of sales for new and resale properties including single family detached residences and condominiums was up 53 5 percent according to mda dataquick
6551806 the median sales price was down 44 1 percent year to year dropping 242 000 in the past year from 549 000 in july 2007 to 307 000
6551807 dataquick president john walsh said the sales increases dont necessarily point to a sustainable rebound in the housing industry a clearer picture of the entire housing market will emerge once more of these foreclosures burn off and more lenders sellers and buyers get off the sidelines and back into the housing game he said
6551808 in less than a year roughly 408 000 square feet of industrial and office buildings on about 22 acres of land at douglas park are expected to be completed and ready for leasing
6551809 newcastle partners inc started construction on the land next to the long beach airport this june original plans for the douglas park site also included residential housing the most recent plan proposed 1 400 residential units town homes and condominiums however the planning commission on july 17 approved a revised plan that eliminates the residential component of the project altogether
6551810 economic factors have created a deep funk in sales along glendales brand boulevard of cars mirroring a national downturn in automobile purchases as customers continue to feel the pinch of an enduring housing slump a pervasive credit crunch and soaring gasoline prices officials said
6551811 sales of new cars in los angeles county plunged more than 18 6 from january to march as dealerships along brand boulevard have been feeling the pinch of sparse customers and decreased revenue
6551812 new car sales at star ford are down 20 from last year said alex tamez director of operations
6551813 business at the ford service department has slowed because of frugal customer spending habits
6551814 noontime shopping sprees at the mall for pam lewellen of san clemente are decidedly less expensive than they used to be
6551815 high gasoline prices and nagging uncertainty about the economy havent stopped her from prowling malls for fun but she said they have pushed her away from her favorite department stores and boutiques to discounters such as ross dress for less and marshalls
6551816 particularly hard hit are owners of shopping centers and buildings that house businesses serving new homeowners such as furniture stores and electronics warehouses also taking a hit are upscale department stores and other shops that have traditionally drawn the middle income consumer
6551817 times are definitely challenging for many stores and malls according to the international council of shopping centers
6551818 when he took out a 206 000 home equity line of credit in 2007 kevin hall thought hed secured all the funding hed ever need for a major remodeling project at his carlsbad home thats why his heart skipped a beat when he went online in february to transfer money from his account
6551819 i got sucker punched on the thing said hall who manages a remax real estate office in la jolla
6551820 like thousands of borrowers hall was a victim of falling real estate values in washington mutuals judgment the home equity used to secure the credit line had significantly declined and under the terms of the agreement the bank had the right to pull the plug
6551821 washington mutual isnt alone in reducing its exposure to risk in regions where home prices are falling including san diego county
6551822 it is widespread everywhere there was a significant run up in home values followed by a sharp correction said dustin hobbs spokesman for the california mortgage bankers association
6551823 mark goldman a real estate finance instructor at san diego state university said it makes no sense for banks to notify borrowers before they reduce their line of credit
6551824 of course they arent going to call you up and say were taking a look at your loan he said
6551825 lenders could have avoided the problem by using tighter underwriting standards when home prices soared said dean baker an economist for the center for economic and policy research in washington d c like many consumers they gambled that home values would continue to rise and now theyre paying the price
6551826 it would have been good if they had been this cautious five years ago baker said
6551827 five foreclosed homes at the end of el rodebaugh street serve as a breeding ground for wasps that zigzag over the entire neighborhood one of those abandoned properties at 2021 oak grove way has six visible nests along the fence in the backyard
6551828 randy fagundes of fagundes custom yard care was on the scene cleaning up the abandoned home for sale
6551829 julia mercado says the wasps dictate when they mow their lawns when they can take a dip in their swimming pool and what times they let their daughter play outside
6551830 we go through a can of wasp spray every day its an epidemic she shrugged
6551831 at least one man whos been proactive in dealing with the pests is realtor don scorby scorby whos trying to get one of the foreclosed homes ready for sale has gone out twice in the past week to spray the nests that litter the property
6551832 i feel like i am representing the bank and i should take care of it scorby says
6551833 but will the banks or real estate agents at the other homes step up alan inman manager of the merced county mosquito abatement district says the problem is the same as the mosquitoes in pools of foreclosed homes where the county has received varying degrees of cooperation
6551834 after richardson stopped making payments on the home it was sold to an investor at a foreclosure auction but the property was returned to richardson in june after her bank rescinded the sale
6551835 in a statement richardson disavowed any responsibility for the current upkeep of the home because she said it still has not been transferred back to her
6551836 congresswoman richardson is fully prepared when full transfer of the property is made and reinstated to manage and maintain the sacramento property said her spokesman william marshall
6551837 richardsons statement conflicts with available public records which state that she has had the title to the property since june 2
6551838 sacramento police were called to the home on july 21 because the garage door was open suggesting a possible break in the police called code enforcement officials who brought in a contractor to board up the door
6551839 code enforcement officers also found rotting food on the ground which might attract rodents as well as junk and debris in the yard
6551840 i feel like i am representing the bank and i should take care of it scorby says
6551841 i always like to say were intelligent risk takers that may prove to be wrong now said exchange banks veteran chairman c william reinking
6551842 i got sucker punched on the thing said hall who manages a remax real estate office in la jolla
6551843 business at the ford service department has slowed because of frugal customer spending habits they used to say do whatever needs to be done tamez said now people are saying do i really need to change my air filter do i really need to inflate my tires each time
6551844 people with so called liar loans mortgages approved without proof of income or assets are expected to be the next wave of homeowners to default
6551845 times are definitely challenging for many stores and malls according to the international council of shopping centers
6551846 rep laura richardson caught a break on wednesday when code enforcement officers decided not to bill her for boarding up the garage door on her vacant sacramento home

6551850 work with your lender dont wait be persistent lenders are overwhelmed with the number of people out there that are in foreclosure that are in desperate and dire situations if they say theyre going to call you and they dont do it call them continue to follow up said cathy
6551851 newcastle partners inc started construction on the land next to the long beach airport this june original plans for the douglas park site also included residential housing the most recent plan proposed 1 400 residential units town homes and condominiums however the planning commission on july 17 approved a revised plan that eliminates the residential component of the project altogether
6551852 good mini van nice design a little more maintenance than normal
6551853 my great uncle paul worked for the bank in this house
6551854 do you realize that your great uncle paul von mendelssohn bartholdy had a fantastic art collection and owned eight van goghs
6551855 mrs paintings had already been given to her as a gift on their wedding
6551856 public policy needs of family farmers ranchers and the communities in which they live
6551857 no one can dictate to poland what it should do
6551858 polands weight as an american partner never grew to the level people had hoped that also partially has to do with the fact that sarkozy and merkel pronounced america friendly politicians came to power in france and germany
6551859 in terms of foreign policy we are rising in rank to a new league
6551860 economic sanctions cyber attacks and even by applying pressure on countries friendly to poland like ukraine
6551861 theres a piece of the trench that goes passed siast
6551862 theres roads and pipes and parking lots and grass and all the rest of it
6551863 we along with alberta are going to be most impacted
6551864 this so called solution for the environment is no solution at all for nova scotia
6551865 but we don t believe taxing people is the way to do it
6551866 from the day schumers letter was made public on june 26 until the closure of the bank a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable
6551867 it certainly raises eyebrows that the firm promoting this letter is the same outfit that fueled the swift boat attacks and does work for the rnc
6551868 it was unfortunate that reggie was out but it gave sloan some good work because this could happen during the regular season
6551869 our middle linebacker doesnt have to be the greatest athlete but he has to have toughness and iq
6551870 that wasnt good but i think i proved i can play if reggie ever goes down
6551871 i was getting reps with the first team and second team instead of watching film of someone else playing out there i was seeing everything it first hand you learn more when you play
6551872 the highland fredericktown game has really evolved into a great rivalry especially since ive been in fredericktown
6551873 i know that a lot of the kids know each other last year both teams ended up in the playoffs and that heightens it even more when you have two teams that are having success
6551874 its really important for us being the first game of the year to get off to a good start we are very close location wise and its such a big game for both teams
6551875 anytime you lose a group of good seniors you always look for new faces to step up and emerge as your new leaders
6551876 right now we have a few kids that have done a good job of it
6551877 id say that we were hurt even more by graduation than they were
6551878 at this point im more concerned about us than them we have so many unknowns and a lot of things are going to fall into play on friday overall we are going to be a lot younger than we have been i just want us to cut down on turnovers and play a mistake free game
6551879 when we get into those tough situations on fridays in a game atmosphere hopefully these guys will provide leadership and make plays for us
6551880 we just want to try to go out and win every game that we can and try to get our kids focused on the game that we are playing each week
6551881 no matter who we are playing pursuit and tackling are always key for us highland always runs well so you have to get a lot of people to the football highland has a number of fast running backs and their offensive linemen move very well i told my guys that the speed of the game is going to increase this friday night
6551882 thats something that we try to push hard we try to put the fastest team that we can on the field
6551883 hes been a quarterback but we used him as a wide receiver last year thomas has really stepped into that starting quarterback role very well he runs the offense well and he is a real strong runner so we will be able to do a lot of the things offensively that we did last year offensively we have to execute well and we cant make mistakes
6551884 special teams are often the question because especially in scrimmages you dont get the opportunity to work on special teams a lot
6551885 we work a lot on them in practice and hopefully we can use that to our advantage
6551886 special teams are such a vast subject and there are so many aspects to that part of the game but sometimes it gets overlooked it is extremely important and we try to cover it but there are a lot of unknowns
6551887 everybody wants to start off with a win so starting out with a rivalry and a team that you know is going to be good year in and year out means that theres a lot riding on this first game
6551888 we were talking to each other usually we dont so that helped a lot the other team did a really good job too but we just came out on top we lost yesterday so it was nice to win again coming out with that 6 0 was really good and from there we kept it up
6551889 whenever the ball is on one side we just have to tell each other to switch so the ball doesnt get between us we try to keep each other upbeat
6551890 coming out strong really built my confidence i loved it im getting a little better on my hits and on my serve
6551891 we didnt play our best but we kept going we said were going to dominate and we did
6551892 we know how to get inside each others head and calm each other down so we are able to work with each other we said ok we can do this and so we did
6551893 katie and casey usually dont play together but they have because we have had a girl who was absent
6551894 but i am really impressed by the caliber of tennis that they are playing they played together in delaware and lost but i saw the same quality of tennis today
6551895 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6551896 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6551897 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
6551898 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
6551899 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
6551900 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit
6551901 investment banks had been frustrated with the established exchange because they really were never able to get control of it
6551902 have catastrophic economic effects on millions of already stressed u s consumers
6551903 commodities and currencies are clearly the strongest business they have right now
6551904 the potential is big because at the end of the day they are the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
6551905 natos defeat in afghanistan would not be good for us
6551906 worry is not a policy indignation is not a policy even though outrage worry and indignation are all appropriate in this situation they shouldnt be mistaken for policy and they shouldnt be mistaken for strategy
6551907 if russias feeling churlish they can pretty much bring to a grinding halt any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
6551908 ironically since the collapse of the soviet union theres always been the concern about russia becoming a spoiler
6551909 we are examining the order and will evaluate our next step
6551910 we are in a trial and final results of that are yet unknown which is why we do trials
6551911 the important point is that the intent of network management has and continues to be to provide a great experience for our customers
6551912 inconsistent with the concept of an open and accessible internet
6551913 another important step to ensure that all consumers have unfettered access to the internet
6551914 the framework we adopt today will send a message to the industry that bad actors will be punished
6551915 with this order the internet remains in the hands of consumers and the greatest engine of free speech and commerce since the printing press
6551916 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6551917 there is no residue theres nothing left and certainly no radioactivity left
6551918 under normal circumstances in which bodies havent suffered from such serious injures we can identify the people within a few hours
6551919 the wreck was totally burned out and full of bodies there was nothing left resembling an airplane
6551920 a few people who were transported in ambulances were double counted
6551921 a plane doesnt crash due to engire failure or fire on take off
6551922 a leader god has blessed us with at this time
6551923 partially an effort to have people start thinking about the republican convention thats going to be the next week and start turning the page before senator obama even does his speech that week
6551924 the reality is that the range of coverage and the number of media organizations that are out there and the coverage have expanded from four years ago theres a much bigger appetite for news today
6551925 all o ndlighet om man ska ta en fr ga i taget
6551926 om det blir en terh mtning under andra kvartalet s blir det andra kvartalet 2009 den senaste tidens nedg ng i oljepriset har inte lyckas v ga upp all negativt momentum som har byggts upp
6551927 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6551928 he continued picking up on a comment mccain made at the saddleback church forum last weekend when he was asked to
6551929 i guess if you think that being rich means you got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have
6551930 then it is not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6551931 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6551932 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6551933 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6551946 the commander who is in charge of a platoon of kids
6551947 to be an emissary for chabad requires some sacrifice and adjustment to a certain reality the fact that some of the children here arrive from emissary families gives them an edge of sorts while their parents need to adjust to the emissary life style for them this life is routine
6551948 hard in training easy in the battle for the soul
6551949 i have friends in the army and i have talked to many soldiers in my life
6551950 we divided the troops into three regiments comprised of nine companies each soldier received a folder with everything they need to know we give the children a sense that we are fighting an enemy the enemy being evil nature each soldier must follow our rules most of them are aimed at the childrens safety no hitting other children no leaving the camp grounds and attendance at camp functions are mandatory

6551957 when you bring a jew closer to judaism and he performs a mitzvah you are a part of it and its fun

6552363 there was speculative excess in commodities that caused the market to move up too quickly
6552364 that doesnt really alter the big picture which is that commodities have established themselves as an asset class and that global demand for them will continue to be strong even though we had some demand destruction obviously in the energy sector due to high prices

6552382 georgia did not believe russia would respond to its offensive in south ossetia and was completely unprepared for the counter attack the deputy defence minister has admitted batu kutelia told the financial times that georgia had made the decision to seize the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali despite the fact that its forces did not have enough anti tank and air defences to protect themselves against the possibility of serious resistance
6552383 mr kutelia still puts blame for the war squarely on the russians and their south ossetian allies saying that in early august ossetian fighters began to shell georgian positions and villages he said russia had begun to move heavy armour through the roki tunnel from north ossetia before president mikheil saakashvili unleashed his military against the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali on august 7 but offered no evidence to back this up

6552400 whenever there has been a new player like aircel and virgin telecom the penetration in the city has gone up there is a space for everyone in this city mumbai being an important location our capex would be definitely higher for the city
6552401 whenever a new player comes in the competition intensifies our capex additions do not depend on the new competitor but on the requirements of the city

6552419 i dont want to say what it is at this time
6552420 that would likely benefit future candidates that are in the same position but not mr hoffman
6552421 if they take action it would be a new and separate proceeding than the one we are involved in were dealing with people of principle they may keep fighting for their first amendment rights thats what drives mr hoffman and his supporters
6552422 we want to be clear that mr hoffman is impressed by the integrity of the maine secretary of state and attorney general in this process
6552423 they stood by what is right and were not influenced by partisan politics

6552451 if its going to be a close election it could be a huge factor
6552452 youre going to see some turnout like youve never seen before in the state of florida
6552453 my goal here is that african americans who have voted democratic their entire lives will begin to at least consider a republican candidate
6552454 and then ill move to the second goal of registration but it is a slow process
6552455 its a funny thing about obama but when i see him speak and see him on the stage i dont see him as a black man i just see a man he symbolizes hope and we surely need hope

6552497 our other perspective on fantasy is that its the most globally accepted medium for conveying epic stories its accepted over the broadest number of categories in book publishing which is one of the categories were going to develop our intellectual property inside we want consumers to enjoy that experience of being in the world 24 7 in different contexts fantasy delivers to a global broad market just like 38 studios
6552498 our current plan is to announce the name of the game and launch the ip website as opposed to the corporate website about this time next year
6552499 one of the things that were doing to ensure this does translate into the actual game environment is that the concept artists who did this are actually the modelers theyre taking their own paintings and as artists theyre amazing but as modelers and world builders theyre also amazing theyre not having to hand this off to trust someone else to interpret it theyre doing their own efficiency tests on it so theyre involved from the beginning all the way through to end delivery

6552543 foreign companies including russian companies have not taken up the call to develop these projects as a result of them not wanting to work in these conditions the iraqi people have suffered greatly
6552544 the invitations to take part in these projects have not only an economic but a humanitarian character
6552545 some companies in those cases demanded sky high prices for their services thinking iraq does not have a grasp of international financial markets they were unpleasantly surprised when they found out we fully understand global commodity markets and global stock markets
6552546 these contracts are old in many ways firstly the price of metals and other building materials has increased dramatically not to mention the price of oil

6552549 the new pools which are deeper and now feature 10 lanes so the two outside lanes can remain empty have also played a role because turbulence has been reduced its easier to swim fast in smooth water and waves dissipate quickly into high tech gutters the pool in beijing is also three meters deep whereas most pools in previous olympics were only two meters deep that means a swimmer such as phelps who gets a turbo boost off the wall on his turns can dive deeper and stay under water longer according to his coach bob bowman that helps him do his dolphin kick for a longer period of time and helps him go faster

6552563 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6552571 hai sa i spunem pastorului despre asta ar fi mai bine daca s ar ruga el pentru tine
6552572 cu cat e mai mare problema cu atat este mai usor pentru mine
6552573 tata am o imensa datorie financiara nu mii ci milioane
6552574 tata am fost concediat si nu mi pot gasi de lucru am deja peste cincizeci de ani si nu am calificarea necesara
6552575 nici o problema socoteste te deja angajat in aceasta noua slujba nu vei avea doar o slujba ci o pozitie
6552576 a flora e a fauna ao nosso redor est o mudando ao longo do tempo devido ao aquecimento global

6552578 i want to welcome you all to the 162nd season of the nys fair
6552579 its tough out there families are having a tough time making ends meet and with the price of fuel a lot more people are planning on staying close to home for vacations
6552580 i think thats probably true we didnt go on any vacations this year so thats probably true if the weather stays like this i think theyll get a lot of people
6552581 summer goes so quickly and definitely with the economy you have to cut back a little bit so we save up for the fair
6552582 well certainly everybodys watching their money we think the fair is very affordable weve had discounts on advance sale tickets and once you get to the fair theres all sorts of things you can do for free
6552583 i mean 20 they can ride the rides all day long shes got coupons for tullys we got deals on food and drinks
6552584 its a lot of west pride but its a lot of phony unity
6552585 its like lets get on a mixtape together and then i dont give a fuck what happens to you when you need a studio the radio stations need to be more in tune with whats going on on the streets of the west so the radio can even support more
6552586 the main unity we got on the west coast is the new west movement
6552587 if it wasnt from the new west it wouldnt be no unity on the west coast
6552588 in the east back in the day the ogs when they laid the foundation for hip hop they also did things to preserve it for the next generation
6552589 that didnt really happen on the west coast so the next generation is like fatherless kids
6552590 none of them reach back none of them try to help none of them do shit because they was raised in the old days get yours and fuck the rest
6552591 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6552592 little gti youre so much fun i love to drive you
6552593 otways photos capture everything from the fast action danger of a young man trying to resuscitate a friend who had overdosed on heroin to a young crusty woman looking tenderly at her pet rat
6552594 oh aging rock icons how you inevitably lose your edge and charmingly putter about in irrelevance with inflated egos thanks to a media that shits itself every time you undertake the most menial of projects
6552595 a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6552596 having reviewed the video we acknowledge that its inclusion in the take down notice was an error and the error however was completely unintentional
6552597 viacom has no alternative accept to repeatedly search the entire youtube library
6552598 and send take down notices this is a massive effort we have manually reviewed over 1 7 million clips on youtube and have identified more than 187 000 pirated clips of our copyrighted content in an effort of this scale some inadvertent error is inevitable
6552599 if that doesnt prove that viacom knew my film wasnt their material i dont know what can
6552600 universal said she infringed on her copyright and sent a take down notice she then has an opportunity to appeal to youtube counter notification remedy which is what she sought and the video was restored
6552601 the dmca streamlined the process but the law also tried to balance it
6552602 one being a growing interest in advertising plays that capitalize on indias emerging infrastructure and growing internet usage the other being an increase in second round deals
6552603 caminante no hay camino se hace camino al andar y al volver la vista atr s se ve la senda que nuca se ha de volver a pisar
6552604 to act is to live to embody the dreams of man
6552605 we didnt want to parody inspirational teacher movies we wanted to make a movie about a guy who think hes living an inspirational teacher movie
6552606 picked her up and turned her over and she was blue
6552607 our main goal before the tour was to win the test series
6552608 now we must ensure that we keep our eye on the ball in the odis weve been away for long periods this year and id be lying if i said the guys are not longing for home
6552609 it certainly has not helped that weve been unable to prepare the way we wanted to
6552610 we have not played in a one day match for a long time and we were hoping to brush up on our odi skills but its the same for both teams and we cant really complain
6552611 id like to avoid surgery so ill probably have to rest at some time or another
6552612 a guy like delamiellure says the things he said about me you think im going to invite him to dinner
6552613 this is international rugby one cant live in the past we have to stand up and deliver if not some of the guys me included will have to be replaced
6552614 well have to raise our game we still have a chance of winning the competition we must play good rugby and score a few tries for a change
6552615 we did not do well last week maybe we were not as poor as some people think but we did not score any points that is not the way we want to play rugby
6552616 when the stormers needed to score four tries against the lions in our last super 14 match we wanted to run with every ball
6552617 but one has to stick to your structure for the first 40 minutes its about retaining possession and structure
6552618 when you talk about attacking rugby and the need to score four tries it does not mean you have to run with the ball at all times
6552619 that is one of the positive aspects of our game
6552620 the backs have had a good platform that we have not used well
6552621 the other girls were angry with nobuhle because she had decided not to have children now and all the parents held her up as an example
6552622 it made the other girls who already have children look bad
6552623 vibrant and competitive free market for the internet and interactive computer services

6552626 this bill is to ensure that we have the means to do proper planning not only for the supply of energy but also for the demand of that energy
6552627 israel must on no account attack iran speak of attacking iran or even think about it
6552628 israel must defend itself only if attacked by iran but attacking iran on our own initiative is a megalomaniacal reckless idea
6552629 we are not permitted to gamble away israels future and kadimas future people with insufficient experience jump into senior positions without taking the long hard route of accumulating experience and knowhow
6552630 the prime minister does not have to be a general

6552644 the football players here are often rural white boys with baseball caps or hard working black students who are proud to be at duke

6552718 but the fact is that they are the symptom of a disease as long as you have earmarking and pork barrel spending and bridges to nowhere and money for dna of bears in montana and museums and all that then youre going to have lobbyists

6552748 after four years of trying to get the current government and the public to recognise this its very encouraging to get a report written for our main transport agency saying the same thing
6552749 the public has already voted with their feet and started leaving their cars at home public transport in auckland and wellington is bulging at the seams at peak hour
6552750 we simply dont have the services and the government is still planning in its latest land transport to spend eight times as much on new roads as it does on public transport

6552766 this offseason i took time to pray and meditate to just be strengthened internally spiritually mentally and physically and come out and be a good pro every day and be tough and be strong and be consistent
6552767 he had a pretty bad acl and it took him a little longer to recover he didnt have the best recovery from it so it delayed everything
6552768 my theory has always been however long youve been out and he was out pretty much 12 months then it takes six months to recover it takes half that time to get back in the rhythm so by the time he got back in the rhythm that season 2007 ended
6552769 if you watch now hes back to 100 percent and playing well
6552770 hes a tough guy he pushed through jeds a talented defender hes good with his feet hes a good one on one defender
6552771 hes helpful because he can play a number of different positions
6552772 actually his left foot is pretty decent and hes been able to play outside back for us and in the middle its a matter of with all young players consistency day in and day out
6552773 it was tough coming back not only did i come back from my knee tear i also tore something else at the beginning of the year 2007 so i was coming back halfway through the season i struggled into that with the speed of play and mentally trying to be strong

6552857 i bought webwatcher software and installed it on my 15 year old daughter s computer after becoming concerned about changes in her behavior
6552858 i was quickly able to get enough information using webwatcher to call the police who then arrested my daughter s 39 year old hockey coach who was later convicted using the evidence from webwatcher
6552859 webwatcher proved to be a useful tool in this case and assisted in putting a child sex offender behind bars
6552860 i was amazed that many parents know little about webwatcher and even our courts know very little about it

6552870 external conditions aside we continue to deliver improved earnings with healthy margins and i am pleased with our second quarter results
6552871 while we continue to pursue our 2008 financial strategy we are very focused on bringing more customers into our stores
6552872 we believe that this restructuring will enable us to continue to serve our advertisers and publishers across europe but on a profitable basis
6552873 we further believe that our u s and consolidated e u media businesses should benefit from the new miva media technology platform expected in the fourth quarter
6552874 despite significant challenges in the u s economic environment nordson delivered another very strong quarter to its shareholders
6552875 the diverse nature of nordson s businesses and end market exposures provided the basis for our ongoing record performance sales continued to grow at double digit rates and operating margin continued to improve expanding to 18 percent in the current quarter from 16 percent in the same quarter a year ago
6552876 our performance in the quarter was driven by strong revenue growth in our two largest segments
6552877 industrial coating and automotive our smallest segment was negatively impacted by cyclical weakness in durable goods markets such as appliances and automobiles
6552878 geographically powerful sales growth of more than 30 percent in asia pacific and 25 percent in europe helped to balance our slower growing regions
6552879 though the business environment in certain geographic and end markets continues to be challenging we expect another record year in 2008 for revenues and earnings per share
6552880 while operating from a position of strength we will continue to focus aggressively on improving our operating performance and making the adjustments necessitated by the changing external economic forces that can impact our future
6552881 i started to feel like people dont really want to know what my experience was they just feel obligated to ask

6552921 the track will feature keys along with white who pulls triple duty as writer producer and drummer on the collaboration that will mark the first duet in bond history according to the studio
6552922 after a couple of years of wanting to collaborate with alicia keys it took james bond himself to finally make it happen alicia put some electric energy into her breath that cemented itself into the magnetic tape very inspiring to watch it gave me a new voice and i wasnt myself anymore i drummed for her voice and she mimicked the guitar tones then we joined our voices and screamed and moaned about these characters in the film and their isolation having no one to trust not even themselves maybe we became them for a few minutes

6552932 we are very sorry if anyone is offended by the language jacqueline wilson aims to reflect the realities of modern life in the context of the character we felt the word was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie and her friends would speak to each other we have sold over 150 000 copies of the book since march this year and have only received three complaints

6552944 suicide bombing is not just a religious phenomenon it is employed by many secular organisations including the kurdish pkk and the marxist tamil tigers
6552945 ariel merari a tel aviv university psychologist has profiled 50 suicide bombers and found that there were hardly any common factors none were deranged or schizophrenic few had problems like depression merari concluded that the only factor linking all forms of suicide terrorism was the way bombers were recruited and trained it is the psychology of the group not the individual that is key
6552946 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs
6552947 so far 200 projects in 70 towns and cities have been funded by whitehall in the attempt to develop the capacity of communities particularly involving muslim women to challenge and resist violent extremists

6552949 counter terrorism police disrupt 13 terror networks last year from april 2007 until march 2008 over 40 people were convicted of terrorist related offences as a result of metropolitan police investigations and sentences amounting to more than 600 years were imposed the police arrested 46 people in relation to terrorist investigations between the start of this year and may 31 and charged 10 although the report points out that some of the remainder have been cautioned detained pending an immigration investigation or dealt with under the mental health act
6552950 it is extremely difficult for the nationalist tradition to separate out what i might call peacetime britishness from unionist triumphalism just as many unionists find it difficult to separate irish patriotism from at least implied support for the ira i know this sounds piously balanced but i believe it to be the case
6552951 councillor robin newton the dup group leader said that on friday morning the strategic policy and resources committee will discuss the provision of hospitality for members of the armed forces following a homecoming parade to st annes cathedral
6552952 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6552953 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6552954 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6552955 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden

6552957 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6552958 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6552959 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6552960 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6552961 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients

6552973 the 2008 election may be about iraq and george w bush and the housing market but the future of u s politics is going to be which party helps people have babies
6552974 im very pessimistic about a restoration of fertility the main reason for the decline in fertility is that women have advanced they want to get ahead in the world but theyre also asked to care for children and do all the housework men never do that stuff

6552981 the united states consumes most habit forming drugs per capita opium the most pernicious drug known to humanity is surrounded in this country with far fewer safeguards than any other nation in europe fences it with china now guards it with much greater care than we do japan preserves her people from it far more intelligently than we do ours who can buy it in almost any form in every tenth one of our drug stores our physicians use it recklessly in remedies and thus become responsible for making numberless dope fiends and in uncounted nostrums offered everywhere for sale it figures in habit forming quantities without restriction
6552982 few people realize how serious the opium habit has become in the united states
6552983 ask most men where most opium is used and they will answer china without the slightest hesitation but the fact is definitely otherwise our per capita consumption equals and probably exceeds that of the dragon empire and there the habit is being intelligently killed while here it is increasing with so great a speed that we may well stand startled at the contemplation of its spread
6552984 as a result of the illicit traffic in these drugs the pharmaceutical profession in this country has lost much of its dignity
6552985 and this is fully justified by facts the medical profession must include within its ranks a multitude of arrant knaves the greater number of them possibly themselves victims of the drug and robbed by it of all sense of their responsibility to their patients and society

6552988 its an interesting shoot and the most elaborate thing ive been a part of as far as working cameras

6552992 the real focus of the research really needs to be to better understand how it gets out of bats into horses

6553005 while it remained behind the coalition as the preferred party on these issues its disadvantage was small and many more voters saw no difference between the major parties

6553044 mit unserer untersuchung konnten wir die gesellschaftliche akzeptanz der erkenntnis dass es weltweit kein sicheres endlager f r atomm ll gibt enorm steigern
6553045 bereits heute haben wir damit begonnen erste atomm ll f sser einzulagern um die eignung des salzstocks altona zu unterstreichen

6553049 wir verurteilen das r cksichtslose und teilweise aggressiv gewaltt tige vorgehen der polizei aufs sch rfste von den demonstrantinnen in moorburg ging dagegen wie angek ndigt keinerlei eskalation aus
6553050 dieses willk rliche vorgehen lassen wir uns nicht gefallen die aufl sung war eindeutig rechtswidrig
6553051 e accaduto un delitto durante la notte un allucinante episodio ha sconvolto la sacralit di questo luogo
6553052 we are the only catholic school in the fishtown neighborhood at our school we strive to bring out the best in our children because at the end of the day education is not just about being literate it is about becoming a better human being at st laurentius our jobs as educators is to constantly strive to make the children better people we want them to follow their own convictions and become leaders at the end of the day it is not just about the grades and we understand that it takes a lot more to be a well rounded individual than just good grades
6553053 we constantly try to work with the kids and the parents
6553054 things are hard these days there is so much violence and drug abuse and parents are busy just trying to make ends meet
6553055 we encourage children to be friendly we introduced the buddy system last year our 7th grade students partner with kindergarten kids and the 8th grade students with other younger kids and help them with projects and fun activities that go on all through the school year and especially through the holidays it is absolutely thrilling for the younger kids to have the support of the older kids who are not only friendly with them but also help them with their activities it helps build a community within the students as well as build confidence among younger children
6553056 this helps the older children become more understanding and gentle as well
6553057 it is absolutely endearing to see when the younger children run to show a project or something new that they have done to their older buddies
6553058 at our school we just strive to bring out the talent in each child since our classes are small we can pay individual attention to every student no two children are alike while one may be a bookworm and more academically inclined the other may be a pro at sports at our school we try to make every child hone his or her own talent and work on their weaker points to become more confident when you step out in the world you have to have a lot of self confidence and a great self image because that is what counts the most
6553059 this year we added internet to our school in our computer labs this is something we are looking forward to as it is important to gear up for the demands of the 21st century
6553060 we live by our motto which is a small wonder where minds soar and hearts touch
6553061 prior research has suggested that the trend in strokes was increasing but our study shows declining incidence in stroke for non diabetic men both for first and recurrent stroke and in recurrent strokes in non diabetic women
6553062 the impressive decline in smoking and large decreases in cholesterol levels and to a lesser degree blood pressure levels in the population of northern sweden may have contributed to the declining incidence in both diabetic and non diabetic subjects over the study period
6553063 on the other hand we found more recurrent events among diabetic subjects than non diabetic subjects indicating a need for even more intensive secondary prevention among diabetic patients
6553064 the fact that patients with diabetes to a great extent had favorable time trends similar to those of non diabetics is particularly interesting considering that diabetic patients with heart attack from the same population did not show any positive trends over the 19 year study
6553065 there was a student who came to us who was below reading level we made sure he got extra special attention
6553066 i can talk to the teacher and see if the students are having trouble and ask what do you suggest we do to help this child
6553067 we were finally able to get a computer this year which i was looking forward to electricians from local 98 will run the electrical line for the church free of charge
6553068 the church gets something back for all that they do for the program
6553069 we have educational computer games but we also have other games like backyard baseball
6553070 the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
6553071 this new test will eliminate a lot of the guesswork
6553072 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism
6553073 under that scenario every minute counts in providing treatment or preventing disease spread
6553074 a lot of my friends were joining the team and asked me to play
6553075 my parents come out to all the games when they can and if not my sisters come it makes me play better when they come

6553086 now that means we just need to figure out a way to get them there
6553087 sometime in the spring or summer of next year emphasis added
6553088 ive also asked for some additional forces on top of that for the current fight
6553089 but i would not use the term surge because i think we need a sustained presence
6553090 i think it would be quite a blow to all of us
6553091 we know weve made a difference in the lives of these people
6553092 our experience has been and its drawn principally from iraq that when you are in an area for a while people will eventually come to trust you they rely on your security they will give you intelligence and expect you to continue to provide that security
6553093 if you leave those people the method of the taliban or of the al qaeda is to come in and exact a punishment
6553094 we are undermanned in order to be able to do all we need to do in the south
6553095 the measure of a life is not its duration but its donation
6553096 how do you feel when you have this precious gift of a deafblind child
6553097 we feel ashamed to assemble with other people in a group
6553098 we feel good in our heart because we learn many new things we did not know
6553099 since we did not ask for this kind of gift it just came and we accept what we have been given

6553103 the strategic move places the highly anticipated james bond adventure one week closer to the prime movie going holiday window and takes advantage of last weeks decision to move the release date of
6553104 we saw the film recently in london and marc forster daniel craig and the entire team at eon have truly delivered another extraordinary bond adventure
6553105 is a seamless continuation of the storyline that began with the last film we believe november 14th is a great date that allows us to play straight through thanksgiving and right into christmas the bond films have a long history of entertaining audiences in this holiday corridor going back to goldeneye in 1995 the studio enjoyed tremendous success opening in north america on november 17 2006 and we believe this decision will give the public a wider opportunity to see the film over the holiday

6553108 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6553109 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce

6553145 at this point id say our chance of success may have risen to better than two thirds especially once she puts her thumb on your quadrys ship
6553146 that quadrys ship then let me tell you something mader tasfallon hunda thrives on antagonism its a steroid to her for a task of this importance im available to don a cheap mask and goad her toward what i need but for missions of lesser importance i cant exactly spare the time ahhh
6553147 so at least you see why ive pulled you into my confidence so quickly im quite familiar with your history tasfallon youve grown into a more than competent administrator but your susan young has pruned into nearly the perfect thorn in the heel of a woman executive hasnt she
6553148 i spoke with her you know she has her own talents if she hadnt been spoiled by a bribe i might have thought to recruit her as well i was a bit surprised by that
6553149 were speaking of hunda though i believe youre especially suited to serve as my proxy with her an executive liason would be your title but your role would be cattle prod
6553150 it wont hinder your success at all that hunda is doggedly straight i dont believe she has ever strayed from the femmes and that she seems to despise men
6553151 i dont think your skills had much of a future in blackbie mader tasfallon but once youve helped me through this little crisis and weve seen it favorably resolved youll have a very good opportunity within my turnbull red
6553152 no more of that now tasfallon and never in front of hunda show me the way to marm brookes suite now and then you can show me just how completely your old loyalties have been replaced ill let you choose the most persuasive route

6553158 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan
6553159 without that information bm mohamed will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces given the confessions made by him in bagram and guant namo bay in 2004
6553160 it is a longstanding principle of the common law that confessions obtained under torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used in evidence in trial
6553161 subject to torture during his detention by or on behalf of the united states
6553162 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6553163 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6553164 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6553165 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6553166 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6553167 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6553168 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6553169 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6553170 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6553171 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6553172 there are discussions going on right now and we are putting together a public statement
6553173 the first real stereo 3 d for the home will be via blu ray and for that you need a standard format
6553174 if everything goes perfectly this could happen in 2010 or 2011 but it never goes like that
6553175 count them yourself i dont know why we did this along with three neighborhood friends
6553176 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6553177 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6553178 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6553179 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6553180 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6553181 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6553182 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6553183 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6553184 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6553185 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6553186 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6553187 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6553188 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6553189 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6553190 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6553191 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6553192 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6553193 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6553194 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6553195 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6553196 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6553197 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6553198 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6553199 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6553200 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6553201 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6553202 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6553203 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6553204 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6553205 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6553206 give gigantic contract extension and watch superstar go down in flames
6553207 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6553208 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6553209 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6553210 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6553211 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6553212 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6553213 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6553214 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6553215 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6553216 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6553217 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6553218 if one person falls the other can reach out and help but someone who falls alone is in real trouble
6553219 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6553220 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6553221 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6553222 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6553223 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6553224 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6553225 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6553226 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6553227 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6553228 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6553229 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6553230 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6553231 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6553232 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6553233 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6553234 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6553235 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6553236 someone who has a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long term adverse effect on his or her ability to carry out normal day to day activities
6553237 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6553238 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6553239 but if josh will not obey the voice of the lord his god or be careful to do all his commandments and his statutes that i command josh today then all these curses shall come upon josh and overtake josh
6553240 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6553241 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6553242 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6553243 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6553244 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6553245 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6553246 these were once considered the safest republican seats in florida if not the country

6553266 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6553267 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6553268 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6553269 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6553270 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6553271 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6553272 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6553273 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6553274 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6553275 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6553276 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6553280 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6553281 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6553282 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6553283 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6553284 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6553285 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6553286 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6553287 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6553288 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6553289 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6553290 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6553291 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6553292 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6553293 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6553294 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6553295 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6553296 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6553297 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6553298 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6553299 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6553300 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6553301 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6553302 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6553303 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6553304 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6553305 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6553306 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6553307 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6553308 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6553309 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6553310 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6553311 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6553312 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6553313 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6553314 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6553315 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6553316 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6553317 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6553324 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6553325 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6553326 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6553327 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6553328 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6553329 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6553330 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6553331 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6553332 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6553333 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6553334 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6553335 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6553336 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6553337 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6553338 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6553342 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the uk where we can do that
6553343 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6553344 when ive watched him play lately theres nothing physically wrong with him
6553345 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6553346 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6553347 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6553348 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6553349 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6553350 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6553351 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6553352 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6553353 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6553354 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6553359 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6553360 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6553361 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6553362 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6553363 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6553364 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6553365 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6553366 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6553367 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6553368 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6553369 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6553370 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6553371 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6553372 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6553373 i did say that ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6553374 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6553375 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6553376 gene was great leader for us and someone ive gotten to know the past few years
6553377 im very shocked its just a real shocked moment obviously i feel bad for his wife terri and his sons i cant imagine what his family is going through
6553378 i heard when i was on the way to work this morning
6553379 very surprised obviously gene was a guy i played against and knew for a long time since 1977 actually i thought he did a tremendous job with the union and was a great player and did a great job in that capacity
6553380 you hate to see that happen its a very very tough day
6553381 any player who has touched our game in the past 20 years has been positively influenced by his leadership
6553382 whether it be raising the salary minimums for rookies for veterans for retired players you name it
6553383 you continue to look back over the past 20 years and hes done nothing but improve our game from the players perspective everybody can sit back and some people might criticize certain things he has done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader for the past 20 years
6553384 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6553385 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6553386 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6553387 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6553388 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6553389 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6553390 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6553391 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6553392 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6553393 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6553394 i cant imagine a world without genes larger than life presence
6553395 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6553396 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6553397 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6553398 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6553399 we at cinj and our network of hospitals are committed to understanding the complex heterogeneity of breast cancer so that we can develop more effective and less toxic targeted therapies
6553400 im fairly confident that the pavilion has been saved but i cant be absolutely confident
6553401 it could be that the developer suddenly loses interest sells his planning permission on to another developer and we have to start persuading the new one all over again
6553402 the problem is that the government is powerless to be able to take steps to force him to come back
6553403 things might have been very different if he was put on a direct flight back from vietnam to london
6553404 i can see 21 t 72 tanks moving towards the roki tunnel in the direction of russia
6553405 i can also see four grad artillery launchers several armored personnel carriers and heavy trucks ready to move into the tunnel
6553406 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals
6553407 these principles allow the russian peacekeepers to take additional measures to ensure security in the security zone
6553408 there will be no buffer zones we will never live with any buffer zones well never allow anything like this
6553409 they dont show any sign that they want to give up control
6553410 it looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people
6553411 i can only say that russia needs cooperation with nato no more than nato needs russia
6553412 se van cada d a a precio subsidiado por la frontera con colombia
6553413 vine a ratificar mi declaraci n anterior me gustar a saber si el ministerio p blico que est cumpliendo una petici n de landaeta y quiere enterarse de c mo recib las actas tiene el mismo inter s de saber qu piensan de esas actas el ex fiscal isa as rodr guez gumer quintana maikel moreno belkis cede o el juez florencio cilano los fiscales yoraco bauza y gilberto landaeta que estuvieron involucrados en un caso que dej unos muertos en el camino unos presos y otros a n exilados
6553414 meter preso a un ex fiscal de la rep blica
6553415 la posibilidad de un conflicto entre rusia y occidente inquieta a los inversores
6553416 nosotros estamos de acuerdo en participar en cualquier acci n que d alg n beneficio cualquier tipo de acci n operativa o de coordinaci n ministerial as como cualquier intercambio de informaci n
6553417 las personas que intervinieron para elaborar los retratos hablados lo hicieron con base en sus propias apreciaciones yo no puedo decir qui n particip por cuestiones de seguridad pero ah est n y solicitamos que quien los reconozca aporte los datos
6553418 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6553419 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6553420 this storm is going to be with us for a while
6553421 it needs to come and get gone so we can get back to what we were doing
6553422 it doesnt matter if you gave two weeks worth of meals to a new mother back in some ward in utah out here we only give two meals and thats just how its gonna be
6553423 i have heard people say all those black or asian people look the same and i never understood it but here i am in provo and all these little white girls look the same to me
6553424 no im not looking for alan i want to speak with el len
6553425 warsh when they mean to say wash there is a utah variation that comes out as worsh jarge worshington is the father of our country and almost everybody i know who grew up east of the mississippi says dorter
6553426 some folklorists have begun to speak not of different folk groups but of different social identities
6553427 of course absolutely everyone has an accent what i need to do here is work to shed the class and regional prejudices that have led me to stigmatize specific accents the accents arent the problem
6553428 would sir like to buy the green one or the blue
6553429 pray that i may forget these matters that with myself i too much discuss too much explain may the judgement not be too heavy upon us
6553430 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6553431 we arrived three minutes late and they let us check in but we did not make it
6553432 we ended up trying to find a new flight then we discovered the plane we would have been on had crashed
6553433 you are not going to believe it but we are going to fly again with spanair
6553434 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
6553435 foods like hummus peanut butter and soy products like tofu are ok to eat
6553436 you would think it wouldnt because its very acidic on its own but lots of people respond to it really well i think it may have something to do with the fact that it helps with digestion and a lot of acid reflux symptoms stem from not digesting food well
6553437 a lot of patients do come in saying they cant tolerate red wine gerson said but the majority of my patients say its ok
6553438 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl

6553452 throughout his campaign ashwin madia has spoken against taking money from corporate pacs and has said his campaign would not take any money however campaign finance reports show his campaign received over 10 000 in corporate and business pac contributions dating back to march 2008 and he continued to say he wouldnt take these contributions even after he had begun accepting them madias say one thing do another approach to his own campaign finances shows he cannot be trusted
6553453 what i havent been taking money from is corporate pacs
6553454 what i havent been taking money from is corporate pacs and the reason i havent is because i think right now that corporations exercise too much influence in washington d c whether its the energy companies insurance companies or the pharmaceutical companies and i think its undeniable that they have effected policy by paying by funding campaigns of both parties and so im proud of the fact that im not taking money from them
6553455 madia has called for removing corporate tax breaks for oil companies something paulsen did not address in his presentation rosenberg said madia will not accept any corporate pac money from the energy industry or any other corporate political action committee

6553507 i couldnt believe it she said of the realization she had just won a gold medal
6553508 honestly it was unreal to me you hear the words all the time but i really couldnt fathom it its like a storybook ending its something you see in hollywood a fairy tale and yet it was playing out
6553509 and my life doesnt play out that way all the time you know theres been a lot of hardships i was just hoping this one time it would really come through
6553510 honestly that was wishful thinking i knew it was a long road a long journey and i knew it was too perfect of an ending to actually happen nothing ever goes right with my family and my life so this was too perfect and i cant really swallow it right now
6553511 but i had enough balance that i could cover my right its all about balance
6553512 if i say that one gold medal takes away all the pain in the world
6553513 i went through 10 months and i got rid of that pain on my own with my close friends and family thats what did it not the gold medal

6553538 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6553539 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
6553540 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6553541 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6553542 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6553543 it appears that many of the conclusions in the report are based on marketing practices that are more than 30 or 40 years old
6553544 we think its important to focus on the marketing practices that we have in place today

6553590 brano aggressivo e violento che vede una struttura troppo confusionaria ed una lunghezza forse eccessiva e probabilmente i difetti sono luno la conseguenza dellaltro in sua difesa c da dire che nel cuore della canzone vi il primo discreto assolo di chitarra

6553613 our states proud history of union justice confidence is undermined when our public leaders strip our families of basic protections we should all enjoy there is nothing pro family about rolling back protections for some families
6553614 allowing louisianas anti discrimination order to expire would mean the end of any legal protection for gay citizens in the state
6553615 by not renewing this critically important measure governor jindal would remove the welcome mat from louisianas front door it is imperative and urgent that the governor not allow the states commitment to non discrimination to expire

6553626 theyre on a scheduled hiatus and shell be back next month its business as usual
6553627 sanctimony or a sense of righteous outrage can feel so intense and delicious that many people actively seek to return to it again and again moreover this trait crosses all boundaries of ideology
6553628 with subjective certainty that you are right and your opponents are deeply despicably wrong
6553629 we have entered an era of rising ideological division and a culture war that increasingly stymies our knack at problem solving nowadays few adversarial groups seem capable of negotiating peaceful consensus solutions to problems especially with opponents that are perceived as even more unreasonably dogmatic than they are might recent exaggerated levels of bilious social division be partly attributed to an all too human tendency to fall into addictive patterns of self doping by wallowing in a pleasurable mental state a state that undermines our ability to empathize with opponents accept criticism or negotiate practical solutions to problems
6553630 were going to try our hardest not to be violent

6553634 let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth
6553635 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6553636 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6553637 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6553638 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6553639 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6553640 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6553641 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6553642 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6553643 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6553644 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6553645 he was going to document the work of the demonstrators a new york city artist named james powderly was going to shine a laser beam onto the side of a building and within seconds of starting it the police grabbed them all
6553646 he has a new apple iphone and a calling card and we were talking with him twice a day
6553647 im very disappointed in the state departments response to this
6553648 i expected something more than what theyve done they told us that they should have known better and that the laws of china dont allow these pictures to be taken from what i can see they the state department have done nothing
6553649 then he couldnt find a newspaper job so now hes working for the transport workers union in wayne pennsylvania as a graphic artist
6553650 almost every shot in these adidas spots involved creating assets in autodesk maya and compositing them with live action footage
6553651 using maya we quickly populated scenes with hundreds of varied cheering fans there were about thirty variations of fans all modeled and rigged in maya by using just one rig for each gender we were able to capture motion and create custom animation cycles to populate the entire crowd
6553652 smoke is the only system capable of handling the phenomenal amount of work accomplished at seven as our day to day get it out system smoke is absolutely invaluable
6553653 ive been raising money to help pay for the trip and what i keep telling people is that this is going to be a life changing experience for me
6553654 theres something to be said that a black candidate is going to be the nominee for the party on the anniversary of the i have a dream speech its just a great feeling to be a part of such a significant event
6553655 we went door to door a lot and would get them slammed in our faces or have insults yelled at us
6553656 but then youd get that one person who was willing to listen and you would explain what you wanted to say and get your point across and that just made it all worth it
6553657 youve got these younger kids who have so much enthusiasm and excitement
6553658 greg was the only one out of all the candidates who had been in our office and he just seemed to have the idealism that you want in a delegate
6553659 i first became involved in politics in 1972 with george mcgovern
6553660 and ive been involved ever since then the reason you first get into something like this is because you believe in what the people or the party represent for me particularly with ted kennedy he was pushing for a health plan and that was very important to me at the time
6553661 and i decided to run to be a delegate and take it to the national level so that i could be on the cutting edge of what was happening and ive been that way ever since
6553662 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6553663 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6553664 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6553665 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6553666 after four years of trying to get the current government and the public to recognise this its very encouraging to get a report written for our main transport agency saying the same thing
6553667 the public has already voted with their feet and started leaving their cars at home public transport in auckland and wellington is bulging at the seams at peak hour
6553668 we simply dont have the services and the government is still planning in its latest land transport to spend eight times as much on new roads as it does on public transport
6553669 stupak identified goldman sachs and morgan stanley as firms whose oil trading activities warranted closer review
6553670 were not investigating goldman sachs or anybody were looking at the macro picture not the micro
6553671 all those speculators getting the blame for driving up the price these days just who are they
6553672 your pension fund manager may be using your retirement money to drive up the price of oil
6553673 what would happen if pension fund managers decided to increase their commodity investment by another 20 fold
6553674 clear similarity between the speculators and arbitragers of today and smiths corn merchants
6553675 hedged its oil bets locking in 70 percent of its fuel at 51 a barrel today the airline pays about 2 a gallon for jet fuel
6553676 right now wall street traders are raising gas prices with nothing more than the click of a mouse
6553677 their trading is speculative and not for the legitimate business needs of a user or producer
6553678 the standard amp poors gsci index which tracks a basket of commodities has gone up 19 percent in the past five years compared with just 9 percent for the s amp p 500 stock index
6553679 hardly anybody had heard of him prior to his appearance before congress beginning may 20 to sing songs democrats wanted to hear
6553680 there are so many holes in this argument i scarcely know where to start
6553681 when the futures contracts for june near maturity the investment bank will sell them to a commercial user and use the money to buy july contacts
6553682 by making consumers feel the inconveniences of a dearth somewhat earlier than they might otherwise do he prevents their feeling them afterwards so severely as they certainly would do if the cheapness of price encouraged them to consume faster than suited the real scarcity of the season
6553683 we suffer from a fiscal cancer it is growing inside us
6553684 our country would need 53 trillion invested today which is about 175 000 per person to deliver on the governments obligations and promises how much of this 53 trillion do we have zip
6553685 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6553686 many of the slotted speakers are impressive leaders in their own right
6553687 but it is hard not to notice the absence of the partys most pro growth elected officials
6553688 reagan democrats in some races but they are still democrats
6553689 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6553690 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6553691 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6553692 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6553693 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6553694 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6553695 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6553696 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6553697 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6553698 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6553699 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6553700 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6553701 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6553702 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6553703 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6553704 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6553705 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6553706 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6553707 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6553708 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6553709 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6553710 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6553711 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6553712 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6553713 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6553714 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6553715 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6553716 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6553717 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6553718 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6553719 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6553720 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6553721 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6553722 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6553723 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6553724 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6553725 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6553726 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6553727 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6553728 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6553729 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6553730 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6553731 michigan is for the most part a red state and its up to detroit and the
6553732 and unless we have someone out front whos able to speak and carry obamas message well its critical
6553733 we have a number of people who can stand with sen obama as a surrogate
6553734 shortly after the convention were going to have a come to jesus meeting to decide who are going to be the individuals to carry that message and carry obama around the state and around detroit
6553735 right now i think thats going to be a big challenge to make sure detroiters turn out
6553736 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6553737 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6553738 the challenges we face today from saving our planet to ending poverty are simply too big for government to solve alone
6553739 if you get a federal grant you cant use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you cant discriminate against them or against the people you hire on the basis of their religion
6553740 federal dollars that go directly to churches temples and mosques can only be used on secular programs
6553741 for those of who us who believe in protecting the integrity of our religious institutions this is a fundamental right
6553742 return the law to what it was before the current administration
6553743 any religious organization that does not want to comply with that requirement simply doesnt have to take the money
6553744 if you cant hire people within your faith community than youve lost the distinctive that is the reason why faith based programs exist in the first place
6553745 disagrees with sen obama that hiring at faith based groups should be subject to government oversight
6553746 wants a faith based program thats even better than the bush program
6553747 his plan reminds me of much that was best in both then vice president al gores and then texas gov george w bushs respective first speeches on the subject in 1999
6553748 especially in urban america all the empirical evidence continues to show that local faith based organizations can make a measurable civic difference
6553749 i am disappointed that any presidential candidate would want to continue a failed policy of the bush administration it ought to be shut down not continued
6553750 i didnt grow up in a particularly religious household but my experience in chicago showed me how faith and values could be an anchor in my life and an anchor in the community
6553751 while i could sit in church and pray all i want i wouldnt be fulfilling gods will unless i went out and did the lords work
6553752 i think it is a bold smart engaging attempt to use religious organizations to help the poor and to do for the faith community what the bush administration could not
6553753 but im concerned that his position on hiring rights will bog down this initiative just like bushs position on the other side did the same thing
6553754 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6553755 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6553756 an alternately amusing and alarming primer on americas off the charts fiscal irresponsibility
6553757 the reality is that water quality in the region has been declining so keeping stock out of rivers and streams is an essential part of reversing this trend
6553758 its easier to protect clean water near the start of rivers and streams than deal with dirty water in the lower reaches of waterways
6553759 hes going to raise your taxes hes not patriotic hes going to be soft on our enemies
6553760 brothers sisters nieces nephews uncles and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents
6553761 individuals are able to live a better life under this system
6553762 stokely carmichael is in town im going to go hear him
6553763 how many are worse off than you were since george bush took office that describes the reality of our politics over the last eight years
6553764 and that is the reason i am running for president of the united states of america because i want to make sure that the next generation here in martinsville here in henry county here in virginia here in the united states of america has the jobs and the opportunity of the future
6553765 senator obama says he wants energy independence but he is opposed to new drilling at home and he is opposed to nuclear power
6553766 my friends we have to have nuclear power nuclear power has got to be part of any way of us being energy independent
6553767 the bottom line i think at this stage is too close to call
6553768 we do not know who is going to win but i think we certainly know the myth that obama is going to ascend uncontested to the presidency through adulation and grace and successful oratory is certainly not the case
6553769 im honored to do anything to help him win but the state and the budget are most important
6553770 because it shows the mccain campaign knows this is not about the base of the party but reaching the middle where the votes are
6553771 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6553772 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6553773 we think that right now iowa is a very strong pickup for us and thats important
6553774 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6553775 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6553776 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6553777 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6553778 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6553779 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6553780 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6553781 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6553782 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6553783 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6553784 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6553785 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6553786 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6553787 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6553788 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6553789 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6553790 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6553791 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6553792 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6553793 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6553794 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6553795 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6553796 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6553797 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6553798 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6553799 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6553800 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6553801 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6553802 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6553803 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6553804 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6553805 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6553806 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6553807 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6553808 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6553809 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6553810 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6553811 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6553812 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6553813 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6553814 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6553815 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6553816 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6553817 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6553818 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6553819 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6553820 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6553821 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6553822 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6553823 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6553824 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6553825 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6553826 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6553827 t he people who are in charge of delivering useful information to the public about the process have no historical frame of reference they literally don t know what they re doing
6553828 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6553829 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6553830 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6553831 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6553832 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6553833 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6553834 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6553835 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6553836 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6553837 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6553838 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6553839 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6553840 we were still right not to cover the story because it came from the
6553841 the story of edwards tryst was reported only by the national enquirer a tabloid that gives supermarkets a bad name
6553842 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
6553843 contributed to the lack of interest by the times others simply relied on standard elvis ufo aliens bigfoot jokes to dismiss the
6553844 the fact that big newspapers magazines and networks have standards that is they refuse to print every stray rumor just because its
6553845 wow hybrid a honkin big truck that gets 40 mpg
6553846 you add that all up and its not a good year to be running as a republican in wisconsin for president
6553847 its an open question how much the race tightens up and whether wisconsin turns out to be right on the cusp nationally like it has been in previous elections or whether it leans democratic
6553848 the cold war by other means and sometimes by the same means
6553849 i looked the man in the eye i was able to get a sense of his soul
6553850 i think it is obvious that nato expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the alliance itself or with ensuring security in europe
6553851 on the contrary it represents a serious provocation against whom is this expansion intended
6553852 fr sean noone parish priest of pollathomas fears for the future
6553853 the opponents portrayed as baddies by shell are the prophets when it comes to our environment
6553854 ever since the hanging of ken saro wiwa and eight other activists in 1995 this region has been seething with anger saro wiwa had been fighting against environmental degradation of his native ogoniland by the shell oil company
6553855 house speaker nancy pelosi and other washington politicians lobby groups pledge support to rossport campaigner
6553856 i dont think any company even shell umh will introduce expensive safety measures unless they have to
6553857 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win
6553858 we do not seek conflict we know the strength of the forces arrayed against us know that because of them we can only use peaceful means but we are determined that justice will be done
6553859 jean smith who lives about half a mile from the plant in kimberley road said she heard an explosion about 6pm and saw a ball of smoke followed by flames
6553860 it was so dangerous the huge dredging machine continued working right over those lads heads and then the gardai half drowned them its amazing no one was killed its a crime that the gardai can work for shell like that
6553861 safety including safety of workers on the site members of the local community and any other members of the public is the first priority of the company at all times
6553862 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6553863 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6553864 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6553865 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6553866 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6553867 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6553868 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6553869 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6553870 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6553871 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6553872 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6553873 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6553874 los angeles blogger juliette ochieng has a lot in common with the man who might be the next president barack obama a lot both were born to kenyan fathers of the same tribe the luo from the same province nyanza and both as boys came to america aboard the same airplane growing up neither ochieng nor obama knew their fathers who both abandoned their american mothers and left their american born children behind both returned to africa in the early 1960s and became friends bonding at kenyan bars over their favorite drink scotch both ochiengs and obamas mothers contracted ovarian cancer hers survived it his did not both ochieng and obama were born in the u s in august 1961 only weeks apart but for someone with parallel beginnings juliette akinyi ochieng is quite different evangelical christian working class military veteran pro life conservative republican ochieng went to los angeles city college not harvard although she was born in chicago obamas political birthplace she lives in south central los angeles where she grew up and since 2003 she has written a blog luoamerican com baldilocks better known as baldilocks a reference to her fashionably close shaven head her soft speech belies her harsh yet thoughtful commentaries on black politics and national security from a conservative perspective
6553875 recent visitors to her site cannot miss her new mission making good on a promise to a kenyan school named in honor of barack obama
6553876 enter baldilocks who lives in a rough area of los angeles is the caregiver for an elderly relative and worries like most people about her bills she hasnt got millions and didnt attend an ivy league school but she was embarrassed by her fellow luo american barack obama she rushed to fill the financial void forming a california nonprofit to funnel money to the african school with a flair for drama she named it save senator obama kogelo school and held a mini fund raiser shes raised 3 500 so shes a long way from the 750 000 she wants to raise within two years
6553877 for gen powell to even consider supporting obama a politician who ran to the left of hillary rodham clinton on one issue alone i didnt vote for the iraq war is troubling for the good general on a number of levels for colin powell to support obama he would have to renounce totally every aspect of the powell doctrine a prudent list of questions the general developed that all have to be answered affirmatively before military action is taken by the united states including is a vital national security interest threatened do we have a clear attainable objective have the risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed have all other non violent policy means been fully exhausted is there a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement have the consequences of our action been fully considered is the action supported by the american people do we have genuine broad international support barack obama as a liberal democrat with neo marxist tendencies wouldnt in any way feel obligated to adhere to any of these points in the powell doctrine as part of his foreign policy or his war policy for in most cases current democrat talking points on whether or not america should go to war is dependent primarily on the last point of the powell doctrine do we have genuine broad international support i cite this point because the rhetoric of obama and the democrats is obsessively concerned with how america is viewed by the world a dangerous way to conduct ones foreign or domestic policy indeed
6553878 it seems counterintuitive to me how can powell a respected moderate republican support the neo marxist barack obama it all boils down to the color of his skin rather than the content of his character and secondly powell was never a real conservative intrinsically because he was never comfortable being loyal to the core tenants of conservatism though he made his career primarily under republican presidents like reagan bush 41 and bush 43 i am convinced that powell is willing to back obama simply because he is black that powell longingly sees his own aborted political aspirations in obama and also that powell over the past 20 years has taken increasing pleasure at sticking it to the conservatives whom i believed he quietly despised for all of those years but now feels no hesitation to openly disrespect at every opportunity since leaving public office
6553879 it was the american colonels even more than the generals who were asking for more troops
6553880 we believe in why we are fighting here and we want to finish this fight we know we can win it
6553881 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6553882 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6553883 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6553884 its been a good summer but were all looking forward to playing hockey again
6553885 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6553886 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6553887 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6553888 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6553889 there are a lot of republicans in new mexico who are not as excited about their senate candidate as the democrats are about theirs
6553890 just because youre 80 years old doesnt mean youre out of it
6553891 read a book write an article for the local paper run for the school board
6553892 because you exercise every muscle except the one above the neck
6553893 if i had my past over again id make all the same mistakes only sooner
6553894 shoot if you must this old gray head but spare your countrys flag
6553895 people who were strong supporters of sen clinton based on who she is and what she stands for are recognizing that sen obama is much closer to the things that caused them to support her than is sen mccain
6553896 one of the key issues in florida is going to be turnout its very unpredictable
6553897 get out the vote is going to be critical for both candidates
6553898 ill take some artistic liberties with it i see the horse in the background and the mountains the banners this reminds me of the olympics really the opening ceremonies but it has to feel like denver this is our once in a lifetime experience
6553899 do you really want to push away new people people that could become core gamers down the road do you want to hide the experiences of this industry from these casual and expanded audience crowds
6553900 the competition was very crazy because we were changing the leader all the time
6553901 i cant yet believe that i won this competition it was so fast it was a dream for me i will be persistent in my efforts and achieve better results in the future i believe i can do that
6553902 i would have liked to go to the london 2012 olympic games as defending olympic champion and i cant believe im standing here disappointed with silver but i am
6553903 im a winner and i had been undefeated coming into this this is the one i didnt want to lose i had to work to get back into the lead two or three times it was a tough competition
6553904 a metal that is dug out of the ground at great cost to be reinterred in bank vaults as a protection against the same stupidity as caused it to be dug up in the first place
6553905 you may have to take it out if you have a bazooka in your pocket and people know you have a bazooka you may never have to take it out
6553906 hey if we really need to well buy 25 billion in preferred convertible
6553907 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6553908 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6553909 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6553910 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6553911 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6553912 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6553913 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6553914 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6553915 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6553916 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6553917 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6553918 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6553919 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6553920 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6553921 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6553922 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6553923 there is information that half a dozen blackwater guards who have been accused of shooting and killing 17 iraqis are to be tried in washington
6553924 the iraqi government stresses its rights and that blackwater guards have committed crimes against iraqi victims the government reserves the right to prosecute them
6553925 saddam hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with saddam there is one big difference he has used them not once but repeatedly i have no doubt today that left unchecked saddam hussein will use these terrible weapons again
6553926 you allow someone like saddam hussein to get nuclear weapons ballistic missiles chemical weapons biological weapons how many people is he going to kill with such weapons we are not going to allow him to succeed
6553927 threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its wmd programs
6553928 every nation has to be either for us or against us those who harbor terrorists or who finance them are going to pay a price
6553929 iraq continues to be a safe haven transit point or operational node for groups and individuals who direct violence against the united states saddams intelligence service supported financially ansar al islam whose members were being trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
6553930 husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations make him a terrible danger to the people of the united states
6553931 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins wmds
6553932 every day saddam gets closer to his long term goal of nuclear capability
6553933 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the u s and our allies
6553934 to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq
6553935 saddam is in material breach the legitimacy of the security council is at stake and if the security council does not call for the use of force i think we have little option but to act with a larger group of willing nations if possible and alone if we must
6553936 yes saddam has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
6553937 the world is far safer with the removal of saddam
6553938 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6553939 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6553940 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6553941 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6553942 the water in my bowl on the floor in the kitchen was just filled an hour ago
6553943 ill pass on the drink shimmy just tell me why im here
6553944 id say the bathtub but no ones home to turn on the spigot
6553945 i need to know if ann coulter really killed that guy or not
6553946 ann coulter thinks about dead people when shes making love

6553949 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
6553950 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
6553951 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
6553952 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
6553953 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
6553954 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
6553955 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
6553956 many in the christian right tend to get their information
6553957 if you bend your back people will ride your back
6553958 you know if you bend your back people will ride your back but if you stand up straight people cant ride your back so thats what we did we just stood up straight
6553959 something you want to do but isnt necessarily the right thing to do
6553960 i can stop it at anytime i just dont want to

6553966 i was tasked by the atp board three years ago to create a vision that would involve bold changes for our sport i believe that has now been achieved
6553967 i believe we have delivered the biggest modernisation of the atp tour since its inception have attracted unprecedented levels of investment into mens tennis and have begun to feed the growing appetite for mens tennis globally both in established and emerging markets
6553968 when i entered the water i had a feeling that i was going to win
6553969 i didnt notice the score of emilie heymans but i felt that theres some pressure from her
6553970 ive competed a lot so i just tried to dive as i dive in the training
6553971 i was a little surprised that i was leading but i was sure that it was really close
6553972 i knew that the chinese diver had a really good last dive and she could do it for 10s most of the time
6553973 before the fifth dive i heard theloud cheering from the spectators and i felt that my scores lagged behind
6553974 we didnt win this event at the last two olympic games so i became nervous
6553975 once i stood on the platform i was concentrated into the competition
6553976 ex friends falling out with allen ginsberg lionel and diana trilling lillian hellman hannah arendt and norman mailer
6553977 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6553978 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6553979 redoubling efforts to bring it a deal to a final conclusion
6553980 it has taken us a very long time but we are very very close to close this agreement
6553981 still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6553982 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6553983 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that

6554013 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6554014 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6554015 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

6554018 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6554019 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6554020 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6554021 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6554022 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6554023 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6554024 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt

6554037 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6554038 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters

6554040 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6554041 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them

6554051 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6554052 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6554053 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6554054 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6554055 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6554056 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning

6554073 our gross margin rate in the second quarter of last year was affected negatively by a strategic decision to accelerate the clearance of slow selling merchandise
6554074 while we are encouraged with our financial results for the second quarter and first half of this year we are being cautious in how we manage our business for the balance of the year given the uncertain economic environment in which we operate particularly as it relates to consumer spending we currently expect our net income for the full year excluding the 0 10 per share impairment charge recorded during our first fiscal quarter to be in a range of 0 70 to 0 85 per share

6554127 as our economy and population increases so does the demand for water water is a precious resource and should be used wisely treated water is expensive to produce

6554177 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6554178 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6554179 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6554180 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6554181 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6554182 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6554183 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6554184 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6554185 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6554186 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6554187 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6554188 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6554189 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6554190 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6554191 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6554192 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6554193 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6554194 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6554195 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6554196 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6554197 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6554198 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6554199 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6554200 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6554201 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6554202 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6554203 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6554204 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6554205 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6554206 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6554207 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6554208 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6554209 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6554210 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6554211 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6554212 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6554213 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6554214 but he said this project really looked like it was doable

6554216 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

6554432 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
6554433 in life everything changes i believe that there are ten top clubs in world football and when a couple of clubs are interested in you and offer better terms i believe that others would have done exactly the same but arsenal is dear to me and i am grateful to wenger for everything he has done for me
6554434 as an arsenal player i can say that there is no better club in the english premiership
6554435 i am very grateful to ars ne wenger he is the best coach in my career and not just a coach he is a very good man and intuitive psychologist i very much appreciate his support
6554436 i talked to him twice before the end of the season it is also not that easy for me to leave this club because it has become my home i think he is upset though it is better to ask him maybe he is glad
6554437 cesc fabregas and i understand each other very well on the field and it is very very pleasurable for me to play with him hes a very pleasant guy both in life and as a footballer he is just more egoistic in goal scoring opportunities if he had a chance to score he always used it unlike me
6554438 there was nothing like that everything is not so bleak its all rubbish people made up some ice cream story really i only gave away tickets as the son of my agent nikolai shpilevski came to the match i passed on tickets for him through these people they were not inter representatives i have spoken to wenger about this numerous times we have a normal relationship
6554439 no i really like london its a very old city there are a lot of attractions you can do something new every day and there is always somewhere to go at night the fans are very friendly
6554440 selfish in front of goal and not wanting to pass
6554441 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6554442 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6554443 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6554444 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6554445 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6554446 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6554447 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6554448 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6554449 the bottom line was that we didnt want this to drag on
6554450 ill have to look into how many houses i own
6554451 the world should know what is happening there were a thousand or more south ossetians killed
6554452 the arrival of russian troops saved maybe a thousand or more lives
6554453 a requiem for those who died at the hands of the aggressors for those who sacrificed their lives defending their homeland from a treacherous attack by georgia
6554454 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6554455 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6554456 were delighted to have a debate on judgment with barack obama who bought his own million dollar mansion in a shady deal with a convicted felon sen obama is obviously frustrated and abandoning his politics of hope for negative personal attacks
6554457 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6554458 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6554459 guards who monitor him 24 7 let me through when i showed my olympic press credentials
6554460 aim at heaven you get earth thrown in aim at earth and you get neither
6554461 wine is a mocker and beer a brawler whoever is led astray by them is not wise
6554462 set an example in speech in life in love in faith and in purity

6554468 no one on the team wanted to talk about it and i was getting frustrated
6554469 i wanted to talk about it i wanted to do something with the other teams to make a statement
6554470 i walked up to stacey porter their main hitter and said can i talk to you a second
6554471 i told her i know you guys had a tough loss and i dont know whats going to happen in our game tonight but we need to unite and create a message
6554472 it was that moment i realized no matter what happened i wanted to do this after the game
6554473 every time i needed to get through a workout or a run i closed my eyes and imagined a gold medal and that has driven me for the last four years
6554474 to have that not happen i am heartbroken i feel exhausted its been a rough day
6554475 it was hard to go up to australia and japan after the game and say hey can we do something together united sure we were just feeling this negativity toward each other but lets do something positive
6554476 but this is not about america its not about the eight teams that are here this game is so much bigger than us and it was so much more important for us to do this with a loss than after a win
6554477 that was the question of the week do you think dominating this game hurts the sport i kept saying over and over we dont dominate
6554478 at first they thought we wanted to play catch with them
6554479 then they thought we wanted to take pictures with their team i didnt know if they ever truly understood so i said just come with me and i took them by the hands
6554480 we split the three buckets between us and started placing balls on the field
6554481 i walked over to yukiko ueno and handed her a ball
6554482 i was holding hands with stacey porter and ueno the pitcher who just defeated us and we were chanting back softball
6554483 it was beautiful i felt more emotional than i did all day
6554484 it shows that this sport is a lot more equal than people say
6554485 that was the question of the week do you think dominating this game hurts the sport i kept saying over and over we dont dominate
6554486 there is disparity and so much talent in this sport those questions bothered me because the olympics should be about doing your best i know there are people who are happy we lost because they think its better for the sport and that frustrates me that is not what sport is about
6554487 since when has someone told michael were going to eliminate swimming because you are doing way too well

6554491 eu fiquei louca comecei a tremer e comecei a perguntar o que fazia ent o arrumo um m dico um cirurgi o um oncologista o que eu fa o
6554492 i dont know whether there are requirements for truth in advertising but it is an absolute nonsense to suggest brian burke organised me to be premier i dont think anybody takes that seriously
6554493 it is a reality weve had at least three labor ministers providing confidential cabinet information and confidential information from a parliamentary committee to brian burke and his business partner julian grill
6554494 what does that say about the standard of government in western australia
6554495 why would you risk labor why should decent hardworking honest west australians even contemplate it
6554496 government should be open and accountable not arrogant and secretive you dont deserve another four years
6554497 i dont think there is any more deserving group deserving of our support as a wider community than those people with a severe disability and particularly their families and carers
6554498 we are a prosperous community and we should do a lot more
6554499 ive been around animals all my life and never had an incident with them
6554500 there was some justice done but i dont think it was enough for what she did
6554501 this was an isolated incident caused by the emotional and physical abuse of her ex husband
6554502 she started it i regret doing what i did but thats no reason to stab and kill animals
6554503 these matches against italian teams are more like a game of chess
6554504 lest it be thought that there is any true distinction between national security and the rule of law we need only refer to the attorney generals adoption of the principle that preserving the rule of law constitutes an important component in the means by which democracy is secured
6554505 you know theyre giving up when they no longer bother to inform themselves about what they themselves say is happening
6554506 how the internet might replace the newspaper as a source of information is never explained by those who assure you that it will
6554507 we should there in palestine form a portion of a rampart of europe against asia an outpost of civilisation as opposed to barbarism
6554508 nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non jewish communities in palestine
6554509 pan arabism can in many senses be read as a response to the idea championed by zionism of an ethnically pure state for the jews in the midst of the arab region
6554510 i was born in jerusalem when the country was still called palestine i remember a happy settled existence with my parents my sister and my brother we expected to grow old in our country and some day to be buried in its soil
6554511 the terrible losses we had incurred were trivialised and dismissed as if we had been impostors had owned nothing in that country perhaps had never even been there until i found myself doubting my own memories and experience
6554512 it is a serious mistake to suggest that palestinian identity emerged mainly as a response to zionism
6554513 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6554514 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
6554515 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6554516 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
6554517 there are believed to be about 500 to 1 500 sperm whales that reside in the gulf
6554518 the five year study has greatly contributed to our knowledge of sperm whales especially those found in the gulf of mexico its also raised new questions we need to know more about such as their feeding and breeding patterns theres still a lot we dont know about these huge creatures
6554519 its gonna be an awesome party with more than 7 things i like

6554521 worth a stop on every trip both ways from sea tac to portland in fact i arrange my flights to and from minneapolis so that ill be driving through kalama around lunch or dinner time crazy
6554522 the measures to be implemented are those developed since last july and take into account issues of identity related crimes economic fraud and identification of stolen passports
6554523 it is vital that the security of cargo is fully guaranteed so there could be a more prosperous trade with sustained growth rates

6554528 after three rounds of failed testing it is apparent that this system is not ready to move forward m a com has not met its contractual obligations and new york cant afford to spend 2 billion on a system that doesnt work right

6554530 i really hope to learn a lot i hope to make it through calculus study meet a lot of new people study and have fun
6554531 we sign it moa ad and everything will calm down
6554532 if we sign the moa ad and the milf leadership fails to control its forces the agreements purpose would not be achieved which is to restore peace
6554533 ours is an islamic organization and the leadership has authority over the followers not merely on organization aspect but it is a religious duty of all the members to follow the leader this is enshrined in our ideology so we are in control
6554534 i think they were not able to implement the obligations their responsibility to inform their side their constituents many say that it is only now that they heard about this moa this ancestral domain when in fact we have been talking for more than four years
6554535 this can be a beginning of the war if not properly handled but it can also as i have said there is still a chance in going back to peace as long as both parties for us and for the side of the government will implement utmost restraint in order to hold back the situation
6554536 we are trying our best to restrain our commanders in order to save the situation
6554537 in fact commander bravo already has made his commitment unless he is attacked he will no longer make another attack likewise with commander kato
6554538 there were so many delays in the negotiations there has been actuations by the grp that they were trying to renege on what had been agreed on already
6554539 from negotiations our focus shall shift to dialogue with the communities or government conducting authentic conversations or dialogues with the people the focus of our talks shall shift from armed groups to the community the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between constitutionality and public sentiment
6554540 our engagements with all armed groups shall be about disarmament demobilization and rehabilitation

6554542 in case of the susceptible markets demand from occupiers in the it ites segment could be rationalised on the back of economic slowdown in the us
6554543 this coupled with the strong supply pipeline in many of these markets could lead to a potential consolidation in the respective markets leading to relatively higher vacancies
6554544 if the global economic slowdown sustains we foresee the vacancies to rise in these micro markets due to strong supply volumes this might put pressure on the rental values next year
6554545 alguien que quiz no posea una mansi n con piscina que no pueda tomar vacaciones anuales en el caribe podr a beneficiarse econ micamente si reduce sus emisiones de co2
6554546 no es cuesti n de cargar sobre las espaldas de los ciudadanos toda la responsabilidad en las emisiones que se generan en la producci n y consumo de bienes o en la de energ a es m s que yo pueda ir andando al trabajo o en un transporte p blico no contaminante y as reduzca la huella de carbono no depende s lo de m sino de administraciones y empresas que deben poner los medios para que lo pueda hacer
6554547 detr s de cada gramo de emisi n por habitante hay una el ctrica una cementera un fabricante de piensos una papelera o una empresa ganadera si stos redujeran su huella de carbono permitir an que la del ciudadano fueran menor
6554548 la energ a que se consume en una gran ciudad depende en gran medida de c mo est dise ada en cuanto al reparto del suelo entre distintas actividades y funciones cuando se toman decisiones urban sticas desde un ayuntamiento hay que ser muy consciente de sus efectos energ ticos
6554549 hay que ir directamente a una regulaci n obligatoria del sector para que se compruebe y verifique todo el sistema de compensaciones
6554550 estamos en un periodo de prueba y error por lo cual hasta que no exista un sistema fiable de verificaci n nosotros recomendamos siempre reducir y si no queda m s remedio se estudia la compensaci n
6554551 una de las preguntas m s frecuentes est relacionada con el vuelo que van a hacer cuando salen de vacaciones que es donde m s emisiones se generan en corto espacio de tiempo y c mo pueden compensar esa huella
6554552 como elemento principal a ade berm dez el proyecto debe tener cero emisiones aparte de otras consideraciones ambientales y sociales que en nuestro caso se verifican a trav s de auditor as externas
6554553 las giras de madonna producen 440 toneladas de co2 en cuatro meses y las de red hot chilli peppers 220 toneladas durante medio a o principalmente derivadas de las emisiones de sus desplazamientos en aviones privados
6554554 3 000 veces lo que un brit nico al a o
6554555 sobre todo hay que subrayar el enorme bien que conlleva ese esfuerzo para la humanidad y para quien apuesta por reducir porque en absoluto supone que perdamos calidad de vida s lo hay que pensar que una ciudad con menos coches y con menos emisiones de co2 es una ciudad m s limpia m s habitable y m s sana para todos

6554560 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6554561 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6554562 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6554563 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6554564 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6554565 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6554566 the marvel of ian ricksons rapturous interpretation of the seagull which quickly became a must have and largely unhaveable ticket is how seamlessly it captures the vital paradox that so often escapes productions of this masterwork the bursting theatrical fullness to be found in its unfulfilled lives kristin scott thomas is in expert form productions like mr ricksons the seagull are such rarities that it hardly seems fair to measure others against them
6554567 the finest british production of chekhov in recent memory with a pitch perfect cast elegant staging and the clarity and cunning of christopher hamptons adaptation
6554568 a bold supremely truthful production chekhovs plays live on a knife edge routinely described as tragic comic most productions however topple over into either doomy tragedy or overly fierce comedy the exhilaration of ricksons balancing act is evident from the very opening

6554574 charges of very disturbing behavior by mccall have come to light
6554575 the voters deserve to know fully what happened on the night in question mccall was accused of being intoxicated and trying to force a woman into a van late at night if these charges are true they cast into serious doubt mccalls ability to properly represent the people of tennessee

6554583 the human brain is always trying to determine why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations
6554584 christians and new agers paranormalists etc all have one thing in common a spiritual orientation to the world
6554585 i believe they do exist but im not sure about this
6554586 i guess we will find out if this is on the up and up
6554587 the likelihood is that in 100 000 years time we shall either have reverted to wild barbarism or else civilisation will have advanced beyond all recognition into colonies in outer space
6554588 it is almost as if the human brain were specifically designed to misunderstand darwinism and to find it hard to believe
6554589 by simple common sense i dont believe in god in none
6554590 it is the inevitable effect of religion on public policy that makes it a matter of public concern

6554637 ringtones have become such personal statements that a specially created condom ringtone seemed just the right way of combining a practical message with a fun approach
6554638 the idea is to tackle the inhibitions and taboos that can be associated with condoms
6554639 conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
6554640 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible

6554644 steeds weer zie ik het moment voor me het is iets waar ik nooit meer van af kom mijn naam is matysh grootveld een product van een nederlandse vrouw en een man waarvan ik de afkomst niet eens weet mijn vader is nooit in mijn leven geweest misschien is dat wel wat mij nu in deze positie heeft gebracht
6554645 het is nu denk ik een kleine zeven jaar geleden vier jaar geleden dat ik de daad heb verricht die ik niet langer op mijn geweten kan hebben het was een mooie zonnige meidag net als vandaag ik lag nog heerlijk op n oor toen ik plotseling een telefoontje kreeg wie het was weet ik niet maar hij wist van mijn kleine bijverdienste af ik nam de ingewikkelde opdracht maar al te graag aan ik moest zoals vaker een hit amp run uitvoeren maar nu op iemand die je niet zo snel kan bereiken begrijp me niet verkeerd ik heb moeilijke dingen gedaan en geflikt maar het omleggen van iemand van de orde is iets wat ik nooit had durven dromen om te doen
6554646 de naam van de opdrachtgever had ik op dat moment echter niet meegekregen
6554647 ik begon echter wel met het infiltreren van de vereniging het duurde niet lang voordat ik over het hoe en wat wist en ik precies wist hoe ik het allemaal ging doen ik zou vergif gebruiken en marcus zou sterven tijdens de be diging van afgestudeerde westpointers het duurde alleen nog eens twee jaar voordat ik de geschikte lichting had gevonden volgens velen waren deze zeven studenten de meest getalenteerde westpointers ooit die uit leuven waren voortgekomen iedereen was trots op ze ik trof de voorbereidingen en informeerde mijn opdrachtgever of beter gezegd een opdrachtgeefster ik heb madeleine leren kennen
6554648 monseigneur de gevallen jonge man die buiten op de drempel van de kerk ligt kent u hem
6554649 nee ik heb maar een persoon gehad en dat was een vrouw op hogeleeftijd jonge mensen biechten niet meneer agent wat is uw naam eigenlijk
6554650 matysh dit was een deel van wat je te wachten staat haal madeleine terug en zuiver uw eigenste naam er zitten nog drie kogels in het pistool deze kunnen alle drie van u worden mits u madeleine spoedig vind ik ben zo vriendelijk geweest om u al vast in de juiste richting te wijzen
6554651 meneer grootveld het is tijd voor de dienst gaat u mee
6554652 goedemorgen mensen welkom op deze mooie zondag morgen in dit prachtige ziekenhuis
6554653 allereerst heb ik een paar mededelingen allereerst wil ik gaarne stilstaan bij de overledenen van deze week in een gebed zullen wij mevrouw durbuy mijnheer terselle mevrouw zwaan en deheer montfoort herdenken daarnaast wil ik u wijzen op de speciale eredienst vanavond en op de mogelijkheid om na deze dienst persoonlijk contact met mij te hebben tot nu toe heb ik n aanmelding ontvangen van mijnheer grootveld als er nog meer gegadigden zijn dan kunt u zich wenden tot de verplegers en verpleegsters in de zaal en zij zullen een afspraak met u maken
6554654 sorry mijnheer maar de aanmelding kwam van mij ergens had ik het gevoel dat u met ferdinand moest praten
6554655 wel mijnheer verbene heeft het zo altijd over ene man in het leven van zijn dochter een man die zij had leren kennen in leuven een man met de naam grootveld ik dacht dat u om die reden maar eens met hem moest gaan spreken
6554656 wel ik ben al enkele jaren samen met deheer verberne eigenlijk sinds hij hier onverwacht is komen prediken nadat hij was overgeplaatst van antwerpen naar gent
6554657 ja hij kreeg een brief van zijn dochter over een situatie die uit de hand zou lopen
6554658 goedemiddag heer grootveld fijn dat u tijd voor mij vrij wilde maken
6554659 ik begreep van aya dat u weet waarom u hier bent
6554660 u zit hier omdat u meer weet over de situatie waarin madeleine verkeerd ik weet dat u madeleine al geruime tijd kent via de universiteit leuven ook weet ik dat u beiden bij de zogenaamde orde van de campus zit daar beter bekend als de westpointers allereerst wil ik uw dank betuigen van het feit dat u mijn madeleineke heeft losgeweekt van het verraderlijke web toch zit zij nu weer zwaar in de problemen mijnheer grootveld een probleem waar ook u bij betrokken bent naar ik van haar begrijp u bent namelijk niet zo maar hier vertelde madeleineke mij
6554661 ik begrijp uit uw woorden dat u haar elke dag nog spreekt
6554662 u heeft inderdaad gelijk dat ik in een probleem ben betrokken waar ik liever niet in had gezeten een probleem waarvan u ook de oorzaak wel kent neem ik aan ik ben inderdaad de uitverkoren persoon door de orde om haar te zoeken
6554663 je bedoelt om haar uit te leveren aan dat boevenpak
6554664 zo zou je het kunnen zien de orde is er namelijk achter gekomen wie er achter de moord op de grote leider marcus demilinis zit althans ze hebben een sterk vermoeden wie het is
6554665 weet dat madeleine niet van haar vriend hield maar van u u was haar grote liefde ten tijde van de studie alleen ze wilde niet meer aan de orde verbonden zijn ze wilde weg bij het gebeuren en begon het te haten zo erg dat ze uiteindelijk marcus liet omleggen nu zal ik u vertellen waar ze is niet meer in gent zoals u wel dacht ze is drie dagen geleden vertrokken naar middelburg om daar te schuilen ver weg van de orde ik weet dat u haar achterna zult gaan om haar te zoeken ik hoop dat u onderweg de juiste keuze maakt en haar weer zult helpen mijnheer grootveld
6554666 aha kiss ma shit all the girls should kiss ma shit
6554667 mocht je het nu nog niet begrepen hebben matysh je zult inmiddels wel gemerkt hebben dat dit niet door leroy is geschreven je had nu in maastricht moeten zijn om nog een glimp van madeleine op te kunnen vangen je bent te laat dat weet je wil je echt graag een glimp van haar opvangen zorg dan dat je morgen in arnhem bent waar in arnhem moet je zelf maar uitzoeken maar graaf in je geheugen en je zult zelf tot het antwoord moeten komen succes als laatste wil ik je meegeven dat elk verhaal minimaal twee kanten heeft succes matysh
6554668 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6554669 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6554670 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6554671 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6554672 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6554673 you can go mommy you can go now are you donna go now
6554674 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6554675 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6554676 i guess if you think being rich means you have to make 5 million and you dont know how many houses you have than its not surprising that you think the economy is fundamentally strong
6554677 if you dont want nuclear waste here nevada you dont want john mccain here the white house
6554678 raised seven children by herself and left los angeles with them in the middle of the night to escape the career criminal who was the father cejudo never really knew
6554679 i wish i could just give her the medal right now
6554680 i wish people would focus on the work rather than my weight i am just lucky naturally very thin and if they studied my art a bit more the films might get somewhere at the box office
6554681 i am taking legal action as its so silly i know young girls look up to me and you know i am a mother of three how and why would i put my health in any situation like that its totally without foundation
6554682 i do get nervous at these big events as its your country youre representing and you want to get it all right i look to see if my wife and kids are there and then i know i can do a good job
6554683 i think its great being less famous i blame the fact i had shall we say a meeting with russell crowe i had never seen or heard such bad press about me here and its been great in a funny kind of way and you know a good thing too because i now realize the world does not revolve around me
6554684 its basically all about me no kidding i am looking you see for a new friend but the catch is they have to be british right hence were filming it in the u k its been cool filming so far and its really hot
6554685 i never wanted to hurt anyone i live my life and i get by simple as that
6554686 i have nothing to add about the girl other than i want my husband to get well and land a full recovery
6554687 she trimmed down for the fact she now gets sent masses of free clothes and they are all basic sample sizes skinny
6554688 she is a nice girl with no complications by that i mean she helps support me and is interested as we both are in the world around us
6554689 she is level headed no drugs or silly issues too
6554690 she thinks its great idea and something that will endear her to a city that has been kind over the last two years plus she does not have to ask permission from the royal family and best of all prince harry thinks its a great idea too
6554691 i may never need to work again but ideally i hope that i will get roles that show off my other talents but if not then i could always have a pop at a pop career
6554692 we have a once in a generation chance to bring meaningful and lasting change to our country by electing barack obama president and sending a stronger democratic majority to the senate
6554693 we need a stronger majority in the senate to enact obamas broad sweeping agenda and our outstanding group of candidates is ready to deliver it
6554694 for too long families in new hampshire and across the country have struggled as washington has put the needs of special interests ahead of the needs of middle class families well it is time for a change
6554695 this november we are going to take our country in a new direction by standing up and fighting for the middle class again if we want a new direction in washington we need real change this fall
6554696 as a proud westerner and candidate for united states senate it is my honor to take part in this historic convention for change
6554697 in my home state of new mexico and around the nation its clear that voters will have a choice between leaders who will fight for our middle class and do whats right no matter what or those who choose to stand for the same failed policies of the past
6554698 i am honored to have the opportunity to address the democratic convention and speak to my vision to partner with senator obama and make washington work for working families again
6554699 next weeks convention will be a tremendous opportunity to talk about how we can change the direction of maine and our nation
6554700 the coming combo of the cpu and gpu ray tracing versus rasterization and why billions of dollars is at stake
6554701 we will launch a public debate on whether estonia should attend or boycott the eurovision song contest in moscow due to russias aggression against georgia and its continuing occupation
6554702 my personal opinion is that it would be reasonable not to participate
6554703 eu me interesso pelo que ela pensa e parece n o haver fim no desejo dela de ser criativa acho estimulante e interessante
6554704 the second criticism is that obamas tax increases would send an already weak economy into a tailspin the problem with this argument is that its been made before fairly recently and it proved to be spectacularly wrong when bill clinton raised taxes on upper income families in 1993 his supply side critics insisted that he would ruin the economy as we now know clinton presided over the longest economic expansion on record the fastest income growth most workers had experienced in a generation and the disappearance of the federal budget deficit his successor bush then did exactly what the supply siders wanted cutting upper income tax rates and the results were much worse economic growth wasnt quite as strong or nearly as widespread and the deficit returned at the very least clintons increases did no discernible economic damage rubin citing academic work on tax rates made the case to me that rates under an obama administration would not be nearly high enough to stifle innovation
6554705 my goal is to create a lifestyle brand something that theres no limit to that will go from belts and sunglasses to jewelry and clothes and fragrance and home
6554706 i think anything i do will always have vintage inspiration i mean thats what drives me its the music i love its the clothes i love its the accessories i love its the icons from that time period i love
6554707 but i think that my number one goal is to bring a fantasy element to reality and make things affordable for people within any kind of budget
6554708 the only thing i could says is im sorry even though they shouldnt accept it my heartfelt apologies for their loss and what ive done
6554709 im ready im ready and im sorry theres nothing else i can say
6554710 the end of a long and painful time for them
6554711 he lacks whiteness uh i mean experience yeah he lacks experience
6554712 hes a guy id like to have a beer with
6554713 i felt like i had satisfied a lot of the sweeter stuff on my first record and i want the yin and yang of it i wanted to put a little more edge on it this time
6554714 you dont want to always be pigeon holed as the sweet and nice guy singing sweet and nice songs
6554715 we did make some schedule adjustments overall and it impacted several of our cities and airports
6554716 its just a normal process for southwest to adjust their schedule

6554811 while we are encouraged with our financial results for the second quarter and first half of this year we are being cautious in how we manage our business for the balance of the year given the uncertain economic environment in which we operate particularly as it relates to consumer spending we currently expect our net income for the full year excluding the 0 10 per share impairment charge recorded during our first fiscal quarter to be in a range of 0 70 to 0 85 per share

6555455 you cant be a one dimensional player a lot of one dimensional players will leave a lot faster than the guy who can do a lot of different things
6555456 i can run i can catch and i can block i think thats the reason why the broncos brought me over here
6555457 im not a natural fullback but at the same time im stronger than most fullbacks
6555458 physically i go in there and i can slam into a linebacker but im really a runner thats what i do coming out of the backfield and catch some balls
6555459 but ill do whatever my coaches ask me to do i wont complain about it ill just go out there and just do my job pound for pound im probably one of the strongest guys on the team
6555460 fullbacks are usually slower they take longer to read pittman flies right in there he hits whoever
6555461 thats my type i like somebody thats just going to go all out
6555462 its just an adjustment for me its just another step in my career this is my 11th year and im excited to do a lot of new things so like i said if the coach asks me to do it i just go out there and i have fun doing it
6555463 i really dont like lead blocking too much but i go in there and ill do it just catching passes its a mismatch me against a linebacker 1 on 1 i can really take advantage of a linebacker
6555464 and physically thats a mismatch too because physically they cant cover me so theres a lot of things i can bring to the table in the passing game so i will say just really coming out of the backfield
6555465 i would contend that the it spending market today is at best flat
6555466 the whole pie is much smaller right now than it normally is and in there tech data grew 9 8 percent for the environment tech data had a very solid quarter
6555467 when the market gets smaller it distributors scratch and claw for every piece of business out there
6555468 if there was a place for the market get tough its around pricing
6555469 those are all market segments that are growing faster than the industry
6555470 even in this down market there are segments that are growing laptops are flying off the shelves
6555471 anything that helps a business avoid travel and transportation like video conferencing where people can avoid buying plane tickets and adding to their carbon footprint

6555478 there is no such thing as arab or african we are all sudanese
6555479 thats my friend abubakr hes from the african tama tribe
6555480 there are problems in darfur but they are not between people they are related to the government and to politics
6555481 no single tribe in sudan can claim it is purely african or arab
6555482 the government made use of the conflict in darfur in a kind of non thoughtful way
6555483 it was not sensitive to the tribal relationships the tribal history of the area and the resources
6555484 the disputes between the arabs and people in darfur originate from different reasons grazing pastures natural things they are not rooted in race
6555485 the arabs that are here have nothing to do with this
6555486 who supported them who gave them the guns wasnt it the government
6555487 i can interact with arabs at work or in general ways but when it comes to close relationships i feel there is a wall between us
6555488 we were still looking for dichotomy of some kind something that would explain what was going on easily and simply we latched onto the arab african dichotomy which did vast damage then as the conflict developed it became a reality on the ground it became something by which people explained the conflict themselves

6555500 if you compare slovak and czech reactions there is one key difference the soviets attacked the czechoslovak leadership in prague which many slovaks themselves did not identify with
6555501 compared with czech attitudes in the streets and in political parties anti russian feelings are much more charged than in slovakia

6555504 early marriages are universal in yemen because of the cultural premium placed on shaping a young bride to meet the husbands needs
6555505 tribal leaders and imams have more influence than the state but its important to amend our marriage laws to create a benchmark we need a new place to start from
6555506 theres an avalanche of factors working against the girl child we should be on a war footing to save young girls from the inferno of child marriage
6555507 even powerful families arrange alliance marriages by bartering their daughters into the power structures at an early age but girls from the poorest families are most at risk
6555508 the cards are stacked against the girl child and those shuffling the cards dont even understand the risks to their sisters and daughters
6555509 we have to establish a trust to look after the girls interests over the next few years we need to find a model that will work for all victims of early marriage

6555531 the rising cost of energy is creating havoc in a variety of areas
6555532 section 5 which prevents the government from purchasing alternative energy
6555533 why this sudden urgency to act now when in 2005 you voted against hr 6 which would have increased fuel efficiency standards and in february 2008 you voted against the green energy bill
6555534 im as disappointed as you are to find ourselves in this position speaking to a fellow city councilman who questioned his practices in congress the government should have done something thirty years ago
6555535 i am looking for an agreement to hold public debates he doesnt want to do that he walks away he gets angry and thats what is wrong with washington
6555536 you dont need to call a political press conference to realize that people are hurting
6555537 we will debate we have said publicly we will continue to say publicly when we can arrange our schedule we will meet for these
6555538 i dont understand why randy kuhl refuses to answer the public he said this wasnt a political event today but his only staffer there was his campaign manager randy kuhl has stopped his town hall meetings wont take questions from the public and refuses to respond to invitations to debate the issues of the day he has stated that congress is on vacation but he still refuses to debate eric massa in public even when the local media and prominent local educational institutions invite him im also confused about why he was here we all know were hurting but hes here campaigning in front of the cameras how does that help families in corning its a shame but thats washington as usual
6555539 unfortunately there are people who didnt have the luxury of having wonderful parents like i did who taught about parental respect

6555555 thats right little blog but why should south africa win the world cup
6555556 because it was englands turn last time so its our turn this time everyone has to take turns isnt it daddy
6555557 not when countries play little blog there have to be other reasons why we win
6555558 but dont you think all the people in england support england
6555559 but we support south africa lots harder than england supports england
6555560 youre right little blog what do you want to talk about
6555561 so if we were dead can we talk about death
6555562 no sunshine were still going to be alive for a long time to come so we have to talk about life for a very long time
6555563 i can tell you who is going to win anything from now on
6555564 whos going to be the formula 1 world champion little blog

6555566 o is oxygen and h is hydrogen and when you put two hydrogens with one oxygen you get h2o and that is really water
6555567 and h2so4 is hydrochloric acid which destroys everything it touches

6555571 the signing of djibril shows how far this club has moved on since the end of last season
6555572 his experience will bring a lot to the squad and he will hopefully add some goals to the side he is known for scoring them as well as creating them
6555573 im really pleased to join a good club with good players sunderland is a club i think is going to achieve things they have big ambitions thats why i chose to come here i liked what the club had to say to me
6555574 help i have all this responsibility and no authority to get it done
6555575 having a r8 directory on a 6 5 4 server is not supported problems that can occur are corruption data loss and performance issues

6555582 no sunshine this is meant only for dust and dirt and small animals
6555583 the birds in our garden some of them are free but some of them arent
6555584 no birds arent free if theres a bird and its got a name tag and it hasnt got a cage it belongs to somebody if it flies away to someones garden sometimes theyre kind enough to take their collar off and let them be free and then nobody knows they actually belong to somebody thats the way i like them to be
6555585 sometimes if youre very quiet you can go near them and you see a collar and you look at the name and you know who they are and you know they arent free
6555586 why do you want them to be free little blog
6555587 south africas a free country so if people are free then birds should be free so people should act free to the birds just like they act to the people
6555588 then the birds will like us and will want to stay sometimes that happens
6555589 they always bring up michigan it kind of gets annoying
6555590 we didnt win a ring off of michigan after that we went through a whole season luckily we had our heads on straight

6555592 these guys out here theyve got the system down pretty well
6555593 theyre running around flying to the ball and in the right place
6555594 this is a critical national security program that has been plagued by technical design and development errors basic management blunders and poor government oversight
6555595 the program not only cant connect the dots it cant find the dots
6555596 the tragic events of september 11 2001 demonstrated that the united states needed greater integration across the intelligence community and improved information sharing to respond to evolving threats and to support new homeland security customers
6555597 nctc has developed innovative solutions including nctc online and terrorist identities datamart environment to increase information sharing and collaboration in support of the counterterrorism mission
6555598 the collapse of the railhead program appears to be the result of poor technical planning and design potential contractor mismanagement and inadequate government oversight

6555612 the problem for amtrak of course though is that they havent had a single new passenger car since 1990
6555613 their cars even the locomotives are old and aging theyre asking congress for help dick durbin has introduced legislation into the senate to try and do something about that interestingly he says that thanksgiving is going to be a wake up call for americans as we all try to go visit relatives for the holidays
6555614 they need more track too i mean not just the trains because a lot of those routes they need to be able to get more people moving
6555615 the most cost effective alternative in our part of the world is passenger rail

6555617 the really good news is that once people get here you are overdelivering on peoples expectations by a huge margin
6555618 although people perceive you in a negative way the challenge is to correct those perceptions youve got the ammunition
6555619 image has been a challenge for arkansas since territorial days when arkansas was viewed as a lawless really rough place
6555620 we made some strides in image but there is a lot more to go
6555621 advertising is not just a cost it actually returns things to the state that the state can use
6555622 its difficult for us to get on the list when a company is looking to locate in a new place it is mainly because of the image problem
6555623 we made the list because of our attractive incentive we were one of 20 locations in three months they narrowed the list we were aggressive and timely and we were one of those where they visited once they visited us they were blown away
6555624 i looked at it as an image investment because hewlett packard coming to arkansas is not the usual thing it changes our image in the technology world
6555625 i think before i would personally want to take any stance on that i would really want to get into the research and decide whether i believe dropping the drinking age would diminish abusive drinking
6555626 i just dont know yet because i havent had a chance to look at that research that closely
6555627 what i can tell you is that all our campuses have very major programs designed at teaching our students how to drink responsibly and convincing them that not all their peers are going out and drinking irresponsibly every weekend and regardless of the legal age we will continue to work on those programs very hard
6555628 i was of course a product of the era of where the drinking age was 18
6555629 and i know having been a high school principal a lot of the issues if they were to lower it to 18 i think the problematic thing of course is the same way it was years ago in my generation were asking young people to serve their country and other things and yet we dont consider them in that way as an adult so its going to be a major debate
6555630 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
6555631 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
6555632 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
6555633 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law

6555664 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6555665 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6555666 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6555667 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6555669 i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters

6555687 nearly knocked her tray into her fat face i also and this may be over the top but at this point who cares i also wrote water polo sucks on my shoes that im going to wear in our next game so if those cnbc cameras get in for a good closeup of my feet watch out major controversy cnbc
6555688 someone came up to me and they asked me what sport i play and i said water polo
6555689 she goes oh is that like field hockey and i said yeah except its in the water and you have to be a good athlete not fat oh and i dont have money either but otherwise its the same in retrospect i probably should skip the hooker part when im talking to children but how does a five year old not know the difference between field hockey and water polo i mean one starts with field and the other with water you know

6555710 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6555711 the raw data suggest a two to three fold excess of schizophrenia in the cohort born in january 1968 whose mothers would have been in the second month of pregnancy in june 1967
6555712 the population of jerusalem would have been most stressed during the three days of bombardment on june 5 7
6555713 the hypothesis is that it may induce epigenetic changes but we didnt look at blood here

6555720 there is no question he has brought in a lot of money and on a personal level i am very sad he has gone because of his legacy as he has pointed out today
6555721 under him wembley opened under him a valuable tv deal was negotiated and i know he is particularly proud of his respect campaign which was overdue
6555722 but the truth is he also put in progress a strategic review ie how should football be run over the next five 10 years
6555723 one of the results of that was to bring in an independent chairman and i believe that once you have an independent chairman the relationship between the chief executive and chairman was bound to change
6555724 i think the question people should be asking is do you need a chief executive of the fa anymore
6555725 would you not be better off having a guy a chairman president him or her who leads the organisation who is elected every four years and can be thrown out after four years if the whole of the game does not want that person who cant serve for longer than two four year terms and who has around them the staff they want
6555726 and then this relationship between the staff and the councillors would be resolved once and for all

6555741 point of order madam speaker the reality is im fit and well
6555742 ive stayed on a very clear message for more than a decade based on philosophical principles that the mainstream those who at one time controlled the republican legislature and government did not particularly share
6555743 but they have proved to be the best principles for the management of government
6555744 they may make a few good sound bites here and there but when it comes down to it those who control the republican party from the inside are too busy thinking about how to capitulate to assembly speaker joe roberts than to take him on head on and win
6555745 his thing is to stand on principle and conviction regardless of how much collateral damage there is from friendly fire
6555746 how has what lonegan has done advanced the cause weve gone in reverse
6555747 he is an influential personality an influential politician he does have his supporters he also has his detractors and it remains to be seen how viable a gubernatorial candidate will be next year
6555748 lonegan has really improved his profile but hes still seen as a niche candidate who appeals to a certain segment of the republican electorate it doesnt look like the republican party is going to fall over itself to promote him
6555749 hes entitled to his view and i look forward to welcoming him to my wedding in new jersey in 2009 honestly if hed like to be in the wedding party hes more than welcome

6555760 jeg er veldig godt forn yd med festivalen slik det har blitt til slutt for min egen del og det ser ut til at resten av gjengen som er involvert trives godt med formen vi er i ferd med f bandene er jo som sedvanelig ikke av det st rste kaliberet men heller band som ligger i et eller annet brytningspunkt opp imot det mer etablerte og s nn m vi for en stor del ha det siden southern handler mye om f fokus p det som skjer i tusm rket og utkanten av tingenes synlige tilstand n r det gjelder flytte hele festivalen til kick og p hj rnet var det aller mest om gj re komme oss til sentrum det er ikke veldig mange alternativer s vi endte ganske kjapt opp med dagens l sning selv om vi grubla f lt en stund p hvordan dette skulle g alt i alt kan jeg vel si at det er en spennende l sning med mye potensiale som ligger i oss fremover og med en lineup som ikke st r tilbake for noen tidligere eller andre som ligger p v rt niv
6555761 sant sant vi er i r en liten festival som flytter inn i st rre og mindre lokaler men som m ta inn over oss at tiden var overmoden for et skifte kick har kjempepotensiale som scene selv om det m v re stille der etter kl 23 00 for v r del handler det om vise publikum vilje til fortsette gi byen et tilbud som dette og v re seri se nok til ta sjanser slik at vi kan bli enda bedre og bredere som festival 2008 er en liten tripp med mye magedans for v r del og vi h per jo at folk ser det langsiktige i dette og skj nner at ved st tte opp er de med p selv s rge for st rre band og bedre festival vi er ikke alene om bygge men m forholde oss til v r virkelighet ogs vi vet jo selvsagt at kick har endret festivalen med den kte kapasiteten men det er litt med i beregningen at det kanskje ikke blir fulle hus f rste r men at publikum ikke har glemt at de har gjort det mulig for oss stadig levere festival ved at de har v rt tilstede som de har v rt opp igjennom
6555762 jeg har igrunnen alltid hatt lyst til v re p kick med sin fete beliggenhet og perfekte st rrelse eneste aberet har jo v rt at vi ikke har f tt hodene v re helt rundt dette med ro etter kl 23 og det sier seg selv at ting blir til gj dsel hvis det ikke kan smelle litt utover kvelden og natta ogs p hj rnet er kanskje ikke den st rste scenen men de har det st rste hjertet og er det eneste alternativet v rt og det snu ting p hodet falt fort til ro hos oss fordi vi visste at vi ikke hadde noe valg det at de som tidligere har spilt f rst har spilt for lydmannen og d rvakta blir jo ogs litt annerledes n n r folk har v rt og festa seg inn med de st rre bandene f rst og vi gir dem muligheten til g p en knallfest med fete band og sm forhold etterp og de minste bandene f r en enda bedre mulighet til vise hva de er gode for med flere folk tilstede
6555763 alt det som skjedde rundt de to siste bandene p fredag hadde stort sett med en noe naiv holdning fra meg gj re og en hel del sl ving og d rlig kommunikasjon med andre involverte gj re i utgangspunktet hadde jeg primordial klare til headline og trodde at mektige mercenary skulle spille nesthead i primordials tilfelle holdt jeg nok p litt lenge med en slags snurre sprett kommunikasjon med managementet som tok altfor lang tid og var i t ka nesten hele tiden mercenary kunne ikke av andre rsaker turne i danmark yj men har st ende bud til neste r jeg har hatt en bratt og litt akutt l ringskurve i r m jeg vel si men vi har dratt inn ting stort sett alene og er stolte av det mnemic har v rt i kortene en stund ogs men jeg liker ikke jobbe med for mange bud om gangen f ler vel at ting b r v re offisiellt avsluttet f r ny runde starter s det ikke oppst r for mye kaos og misforst elser jeg er mektig stolt av hente inn mnemic til southern og der m folk bare forvente fullt tr kk og mektig metall av utrolig r tt sorti
6555764 det blir seri st i r ogs ja det er under konstruksjon as we speak og gunnar sauermann kommer gledelig nok tilbake for dele mer av sin rikholdige erfaring med metalbransjen bl a det er kjetil nordhus og noen til som har ansvaret for sette sammen det programmet s bare f lg med p hjemmesiden v r der
6555765 vi er en festival uten stor stab eller store utskiftninger s noe m det v re vi gj r p en god m te s rlig n r vi vokser og trekker til oss nye unge som gjerne vil v re med sette sitt preg p southern vi er veldig priviligerte som f r ren av benytte andres talenter i dette og vil ogs gjerne at det de representerer av uttrykk talent og personlighet blir en del av helheten til southerns uttrykk utad
6555766 sofagrisene er jo oppe til besvarelse hvert r og jeg blir jo en selv ogs merker jeg s lenge de ikke blander seg inn i det vi gj r med meningene sine fra sofakroken men kommer og er aktivt med i samtaler eller andre forhold som er av det progressive kan de bare det southern er ikke og har aldri v rt en festival med ferdigtygd musikk vi spiller p flere strenger enn de rent kommersielle og vil alltid ha det i bunnen av m ten vi er p det kan jo lokkes med at jo flere som kommer seg opp av sofaen l ser billett og kommer jo bedre vil vi kunne sikre kongeband p plakaten fremover
6555767 vi fikk penger fra cultivastiftelsen her i byen og det var s te 100 tusen i ret i tre r etter det skal vi s kalt v re selvb rende noe vi fors vidt har v rt inntil pengene kom ogs men det er selvsagt befriende f tillit p en slik m te cultivapengene skal brukes til pne festivalen mer inn mot presse og annen type oppmerksomhet som vil gagne lokalmilj by og omegn det er ikke jeg som forvalter all oversikt rundt konomien men jeg vet at vi bruker som vi skal og til det vi skal jeg forholder meg til bookingbudsjettet og gj r det jeg skal gj re s f r promoavdelingen og andre arbeidsgrupper forvalte etter beste evne og vi h per vi ser resultater etter en tid
6555768 datoen er fredag 19nde og l rdag 20nde september alle andre opplysninger ligger eller kommer p det ligger ogs info ute p southern discomfortgruppa p facebook for de som frekventerer der inne til slutt vil jeg oppfordre alle til sjekke ut rets band aktivt ved bes ke myspace og hjemmesider forberede seg er ikke alltid dumt og til alle som kommer er det bare si velkommen til rets festival

6555770 if we let this regime do as it wants it wont stop there
6555771 we must ensure that the russians do not get away with it just like that otherwise they will think they can do what they want and establish new rules
6555772 the result is that we now have to depend on the goodwill of russia the only forces on the ground are russian all we can do is make declarations

6555777 it was an honour to be invited to the embassy to celebrate the opening of the games and also in accompanying me caesar showed many who had not encountered assistance dogs before the vital role these dogs play in the lives of many people with disabilities in our community
6555778 being involved in the torch relay has really brought me full circle
6555779 i was very surprised and flattered to have been nominated by a friend karen ruddlesden it has been like a dream come true not only as we have taken part in the biggest sporting event on earth but also for the other tremendous experiences in meeting top sportsmen and women the judging panel in the better life hero competition was five times gold medallist sir steve redgrave and the opportunity to meet new people learn more about chinese culture and explain more about the work assistance dogs do
6555780 i was disappointed not to have been accompanied by caesar when i visited china as a samsung olympic torch ambassador last month and had to travel with a human assistant but nonetheless was able to spread the word about disability access and inclusion including details of life with an assistance dog as ones main carer
6555781 on the whole i was impressed by the access i experienced in china but there is still a long way to go there are only a handful of guide dogs in china and until earlier this year people partnered with guide dogs were not allowed out alone if our involvement in the torch relay has done anything i hope it has highlighted the respect with which dogs are treated in our country and also that people with disabilities are by and large accorded respect and equality in our society
6555782 hes entitled to his view and i look forward to welcoming him to my wedding in new jersey in 2009 honestly if hed like to be in the wedding party hes more than welcome
6555783 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action it was too dangerous to do it last night so well have to relocate it in the morning its not impossible he will have passed away
6555784 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6555785 while its got life its got hope he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes
6555786 all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learnt to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
6555787 obviously hes somebody who changed the game for players and definitely myself who came in 20 years after he came into the front office
6555788 if you look at what hes done and if you really understand the game and know history and do the research of how it was before gene upshaw it was pretty bad he built on it every year you have strikes and maybe people that have been upset with him in recent years about retired players and how they were being treated but for us players in the game today you have to respect him and understand how much he meant to the game
6555789 i actually had a couple of conversations with him got to know him a little bit he was a great person and i was saddened by that my thoughts go out to his family and his friends its a sad situation but hopefully his family can recover from that
6555790 i think the guys that work with him closely are really shocked by this news
6555791 i came in this morning at 8 a m and a teammate of mine mentioned he saw something on msnbc and i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden
6555792 i tried to search online and find some more information and it was later revealed it was true it was very sad to hear
6555793 his service as executive director of the nflpa is a stamp that all of us are proud of
6555794 he certainly has been a rock for us from a players standpoint and we are deeply saddened about his passing our hearts go out to his family first and to his former teammates friends and co workers
6555795 i got to know gene through my years of being a player rep i cant stand here and say i knew him extremely well personally but having worked with him i know that he is a man that was very well respected for a lot of reasons certainly for his 15 year career with the oakland raiders where he won two super bowls and went to the pro bowl seven times that record speaks for itself and certainly what hes done for the p a and the players now i know there have been a lot of complaints with some disgruntled players with some of the things but i think those are all thing sthat have to do with personal issues when you look at the facts at what gene upshaw did for this organization its pretty awesome
6555796 the national football league is deeply saddened by the loss of gene upshaw
6555797 it is a shock to most of us not even knowing that he was ill he is a hall of famer he has been in the position of leadership for the players association for 25 years he is a guy that has earned his stripes so to speak and just again very very difficult to learn of this news and not even know there was anything wrong
6555798 gene was an outstanding advocate for the players and he made many great contributions to our sport he was also a good and decent man he will be sorely missed
6555799 gene will always be remembered for his great contributions to the game and our league both as a player and as the leader of the players association
6555800 we are all indebted to him for his guidance direction and his vision
6555801 i think it would be disrespectful to even discuss any of those issues right now
6555802 the most important thing right now is to honor gene for his life and what he stood for and obviously giving that respect to his family nothing is of importance right now other than that there is plenty of time to take care of that in the future
6555803 he says he is better but they havent given him the green light
6555804 we wanted guests to be interacting with each other just like theyre interacting with technology throughout the conference
6555805 we wanted to be sure to provide variety so that everyone doesnt have to do the same things
6555806 you hope your horse comes up on biggest day and mine sure did
6555807 ive been through a really rough time in my life and i think it made me the person that i am today and made me dive like this
6555808 our administration has made a commitment to taxpayers to rehabilitate the metropolitan areas road infrastructure and we have therefore invested close to 181 million this year an unprecedented amount
6555809 the work related to the collecting streets network in verdun borough lies within this perspective this project costing more than 1 650 000 00 forms part of the massive investment to be made which will allow us to compensate for the under investment in the last few decades with this we can offer our residents better streets and sidewalks enabling them to get around in a safe and efficient manner
6555810 my aim coming here was just to get a fight ill get a medal now and it is beyond my dreams
6555811 i conceded two in my first fight two in my second and none today thats how i have the looks that i have
6555812 beyond the speeches how much do you really know about barack obama
6555813 given the real time news cycle we live in today many important issues and controversies that impact our country simply do not receive the time and examination they deserve
6555814 we are in this for the long haul and look forward to engaging in a broad range of issues well beyond the campaign the launch of our immediate advocacy effort is a direct response to obamas rejection of public financing which will allow the liberal 527s and other leftist organizations to dramatically outspend conservatives this election cycle
6555815 for everyone in attendance it would have been hard not to spend the night falling in love with bubl s style and music he truly enchanted the crowd
6555816 our findings are promising in that we show these measures show potential for doing that
6555817 from our point of view any tool that might help explore these kinds of things is appealing
6555818 were very excited to get ruiz in here he holds the ball up well and is a clinical finisher
6555819 landscaping those are really nice a lot of people put them by their entrance way to help beautify the entrance into their particular neighborhood
6555820 our situation is a lot worse than advertised and we need to start making some tough choices if we want our future to be better than our past
6555821 were mortgaging the future of people who cant vote and might not even be born yet
6555822 weve got a super subprime crisis brewing namely the federal governments finances

6555881 we are concerned that cemex continues to operate this facility without direct and consistent focus on compliance with air quality regulations and the facilitys permit
6555882 we expect this plant to be operated in compliance with the law and will continue to take the actions necessary to produce that result
6555883 it is important to note that at no time has the publics health safety or the environment been impacted
6555884 we are disappointed that the state decided to issue an nov notice of violation we had already self reported some of these findings and had immediately implemented corrective actions
6555885 the equipment had not taken into account moisture content and was reporting our emissions levels higher than what the plant actually produced
6555886 this is good news as our emissions levels were actually lower than originally reported
6555887 we immediately remedied the situation by installing a new data acquisition system that is more sophisticated and transparent
6555888 our highest aspiration is that cemex is in compliance with all applicable regulations

6555898 our facility is conducive to being a home for an endangered species even though it is an active industrial site the birds can co exist with us
6555899 many people think quarries are uninhabitable for wildlife but animals and birds can coexist quite happily together
6555900 we will keep an eye out for the birds now that we are aware of them we can be a home to an endangered species and help that population recover

6555903 a further test carried out just a week later on the same kiln by an independent ukas accredited testing house recorded a far lower and more typical dioxin level

6555920 he concluded by saying he took no exception to their request to rezone the property
6555921 will harm belle grove and the cedar creek battlefield the regions most significant civil war site
6555922 as one signal of their opposition the national trust for historic preservation and belle grove inc are suspending any involvement with the cedar creek battlefield foundation and prohibiting their use of belle grove for their annual civil war re enactment
6555923 they are suspending their relationship with the cedar creek battlefield foundation because of the foundations sudden reversal on the mining issue
6555924 actually our decision not to use their portion of the property was made months ago weve used our own property in the past and had expanded and begun using their property
6555925 our activities and sole sponsorship of the battlefield re enactments will continue unabated
6555926 the characterization in that press release is unfortunate and we certainly dont agree with it
6555927 i dont think belle groves and the trusts stance will interfere in any way in reaching our goals or working with anybody who wants to work with us with respect to those goals
6555928 when they have taken actions that tend to undermine the efforts of their partners and that jeopardize the regions treasured historic sites and civil war heritage
6555929 it does not help me for the partnership to go belly up or for any of the partners to be marginalized or for any of the partners to be in major conflict with one another

6555946 these guys are working under incredibly tight deadlines and there are situations where theyre panicking
6555947 we can really say weve made significant inroads in this segment
6555948 particularly in delivering a quick editing workflow that can truly keep up with these guys
6555949 you see what these guys really need and what they go through and as a product manager its been amazing to spend that much time absorbing how people respond to our current product its worth more than a big stack of market research papers just to be able to work with these photographers

6555955 dear madam i regret very much for the delay in answering your letter i now take the pleasure in informing you that a b c is located nine miles north of the campground and is capable of seating 250 people at one time i admit it is quite a distance away if you are in the habit of going regularly but no doubt you will be pleased to know that a great number of people usually take their lunches along and make a day of it they usually arrive early and stay late
6555956 the last time my wife and i went was six years ago and it was so crowded that we had to stand up the whole time we were there it may interest you to know that right now there is a supper being planned to raise money to buy more seats theyre going to hold it in the basement of the b c
6555957 i would like to say it pains me very much not to be able to go more regularly but it is sure no lack of desire on my part as we grow older it seems to be more of an effort particularly in cold weather
6555958 if you do decide to come down to our campground perhaps i could go with you the first time you go sit with you and introduce you to all the other folks
6555959 dear madam i regret very much for the delay in answering your letter i now take the pleasure in informing you that a b c is located nine miles north of the campground and is capable of seating 250 people at one time i admit it is quite a distance away if you are in the habit of going regularly but no doubt you will be pleased to know that a great number of people usually take their lunches along and make a day of it they usually arrive early and stay late
6555960 the last time my wife and i went was six years ago and it was so crowded that we had to stand up the whole time we were there it may interest you to know that right now there is a supper being planned to raise money to buy more seats theyre going to hold it in the basement of the b c

6555963 resonance technology like the mit demonstration requires a heavy infrastructure right now with coils of at least two feet to accomplish even a small distance
6555964 add to that a 35 percent loss in power this is not insignificant
6555965 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6555966 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6555967 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6555968 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6555969 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6555970 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6555971 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6555972 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6555973 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6555974 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6555975 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6555976 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6555977 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6555978 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6555979 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6555980 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6555981 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6555982 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6555983 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6555984 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6555985 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6555986 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6555987 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6555988 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6555989 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6555990 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6555991 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6555992 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6555993 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6555994 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6555995 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6555996 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6555997 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6555998 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6555999 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6556000 who are open to doing something on the production side
6556001 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6556002 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6556003 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6556004 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6556005 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6556006 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6556007 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6556008 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6556009 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6556010 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6556011 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6556012 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6556014 a state department has been tracking whats hdrunk newspening with our passports for years amp years amp years are seems to be some dust up here a real story to me is that all of this concern about tracking citizens going about air lawful activities entering amp exiting this country while ay have done nothing at a dhs to shut down a flow of illegals aliens across our borders potential terrorists amp still mexico for example is a primary source for methamphetamines heroin cocaine amp marijuana into this country amp its not being stopped
6556015 brett has been an integral part of our villanova basketball family over the last seven years and an important part of our success
6556016 he is one of the games bright young coaches and made a great impact on our program we will miss him but its always exciting when a member of our staff has the chance to pursue their dream and this opportunity in houston allows brett to do that hell always be a wildcat to us though
6556017 i am blessed to have been a part of the villanova family since coach mass first took me under his wing years ago
6556018 villanova is a special place to me and my family and it will always be a part of me
6556019 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6556020 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6556021 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6556022 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6556023 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6556024 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6556025 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6556026 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6556027 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6556028 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6556029 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6556030 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6556031 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6556032 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6556033 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6556034 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6556035 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6556036 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6556037 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6556038 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6556039 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6556040 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6556041 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6556042 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6556043 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6556044 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6556045 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6556046 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6556047 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6556048 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6556049 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6556050 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6556051 the feeling is hard to describe after all these years i never thought it would come down to this you give up hope
6556052 would say hi like nothing happened i wish i knew back then what i know today
6556053 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6556054 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6556055 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly

6556062 i think there will be another wave of mortgage related problems emanating not from the subprime part of the market anymore but from people with slightly more normal credit and mortgages
6556063 it is entirely plausible that there will be some hedge fund failures and commercial bank problems
6556064 i think this is going to bubble along for a while now
6556065 you dont have the resilience now to shake off bad news
6556066 i dont mean to sound like phil gramm but there has been a huge amount of financial market disruption and the actual impact on the real economy has been limited
6556067 it is not as if there are not some positive signs but to me they are not consistent enough for me to be positive
6556068 looking ahead there is still substantial uncertainty about the ultimate realized magnitude of loss on mortgages in 2006 and 2007 said richmond fed president jeffrey lacker this week
6556069 that uncertainty is out there and that means still the potential for other shoes to drop

6556088 were not investigating goldman sachs or anybody were looking at the macro picture not the micro
6556089 all those speculators getting the blame for driving up the price these days just who are they
6556090 your pension fund manager may be using your retirement money to drive up the price of oil

6556249 the ensite system provides a very detailed picture of the heart and the heart chambers electrical activity
6556250 this information enables us to identify the exact location of a patients arrhythmia and target sites for ablation
6556251 ablation allows us to disable cardiac tissue which causes the arrhythmia and if successful to eliminate the symptoms of these arrhythmias and potentially eliminate the need for long term medication in some patients
6556252 we are proud to offer the most advanced medical technology available for people with arrhythmias
6556253 the ensite system is extremely helpful in the treatment of such arrhythmias it is a technology that can help improve the quality of our patients lives

6556265 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
6556266 i blew my mind and then i blew the worlds mind
6556267 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
6556268 hes a bad mamma jamma the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6556269 the olympic games live around superheroes you had jesse owens you had paavo nurmi carl lewis and now you have phelps and thats what we need to have
6556270 thats not the way we perceive being a champion i have no problem with him doing a show but i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish
6556271 it was a major shock to me its a tremendous loss youre talking about a man whos left behind an incredible legacy from where we started at as a union way back in the day to where it is today with what the league is bringing in dollarwise and all the player benefits and different things hes had a hand in hes left this organization in a very very good place
6556272 well do our due diligence weve begun already talking about that process of finding an eventual successor prior to this well continue along those lines that weve already been on and will identify those individuals and hopefully well come up with that one person who will be able to lead us and bring us even further than we are right now
6556273 the other leagues have struggled with popularity and work stoppages and huge disparities between the top paid guy and the bottom paid guy
6556274 the other thing you had to admire about him was he was unfazed by criticism he believe in what he was doing he was like ive thought about this i believe in this its not easy with the constituents he had and the media coverage to stay strong in the light of all the criticism that he got
6556275 on behalf of the philadelphia eagles i am very saddened and shocked to learn of gene upshaws passing this morning whether it was as a hall of fame offensive lineman with the oakland raiders or as executive director of the nfl players association gene was a tremendous leader and a wonderful person gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans we as well as the entire nfl family will miss his presence dearly and our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife teri and their three sons
6556276 we left 12 men on base we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
6556277 what i will say is the meetings were very productive
6556278 camden was a very welcoming community and i think for the most part there is room for a scaled childrens museum in the midcoast area i think it is a great idea if the community is in support of it
6556279 it becomes a nice addition to the community and adds to the quality of life for the people that live here
6556280 and it shows a commitment to community and families there are a lot of possibilities but that is up to the board and community once the report is given
6556281 we had a wonderful meeting and we felt so welcomed by the camden and rockport community
6556282 when we finished the meeting we were very encouraged about the possibility of a museum with four walls
6556283 as all nonprofits struggling for money we realize this is not the right economic climate to start but there is never a right time to start
6556284 he has been in the museum business for over 25 years
6556285 he will tell us the barriers and give us some solutions for these barriers as well

6556288 who cares i want to get naked if they talk crap about me its just cause theyre jealous most of the people here know i can be a little wild anyway im an exhibitionist and half of my friends have seen me naked some people think thats slutty of me but i think they secretly wish they could be as comfortable in their skin as i am in mine i look good and i enjoy being naked so why not and my pussy needs some room to breathe too it gets suffocated from being trapped in my tight little panties all day long

6556290 we are concerned by recent reports that the chinese have detained protesters
6556291 we call on china to respect the fundamental and universally recognised right of all persons to peacefully express their views including chinese citizens and we urge the chinese to put their best face forward during these olympic games because the united states supports the freedom of expression
6556292 every day he comes out even when hes not playing you see him sitting on the bench staring at the field he doesnt walk around he doesnt go in the clubhouse he pays attention when he goes out there you will see he more than anybody on this team with a runner at second base and nobody out gets him over consistently he knows what to do and how to do it
6556293 hes a professional baseball player he goes out there and does all the little things right
6556294 he just goes about his business and goes out there and does his job

6556300 overall the results basically tell us what we already knew that this race is going to be extremely close on election day
6556301 we are grateful to the canvass board members for their time and the efficiency with which they conducted the official election audit
6556302 equally important is the fact that 814 ballots cast by provisional voters have been added to the official election results
6556303 if one person furnishes all of the ideas to make an invention and another employs him or furnishes the money for building and testing the invention should the patent application be filed by them jointly
6556304 increasingly people understand the value of invisible assets in their organizations it has become the holy grail of the accounting world the value of an organization can no longer be based on facts and events as before but needs to take account of intangibles invisible assets and added value these are hard to imitate and are powerful sources of sustainable competitive advantage

6556308 it is a very difficult way to start a school year
6556309 i can think of very few students ive taught who more fully embodied the values our school tries to teach
6556310 women started off on a more equal athletic footing in china than they did in the west
6556311 it goes back to the turn of the century when western women missionaries encouraged chinese women to participate in sports as a means of improving what they viewed as womens virtual slave status in china
6556312 fast forward to the 50s when this attitude dovetailed with communist ideology preaching equality and women got equal support
6556313 i dont think men resented it or pushed back against womens athletics the way they did in the west because it was not an established part of elite male life
6556314 i never thought that women would be inferior to men
6556315 ever since i was a kid i was taught that women and men were at the same level

6556339 though the vets as a group cheered their commander in chief several said afterward they had mixed feelings about the president many of them had voted for
6556340 president bush stopped briefly in orlando on wednesday to praise veterans defend his decisions about the war in iraq and argue that the nation is in the midst of a worldwide battle against terrorists that will affect america for years to come
6556341 though the president has been dogged by 30 percent approval ratings he was greeted warmly by vfw members a group that is mostly male older and white they cheered when he talked about the passage of a new gi bill which bush initially had opposed but saved some of their most enthusiastic applause for his remarks about terrorism
6556342 its really driving a race to the bottom in terms of service and safety standards
6556343 the really important point here is the airlines have a really crucial role to play and weve been frustrated that theyre not taking any sort of leadership role that theyre not standing up for passenger service and passenger security
6556344 this is a dispute between airline contracted workers and their employers any disruption of passenger service will be punishing to those representing every side of this issue
6556345 while it is not in our authority to mandate a remedy we offer our encouragement and hope that both parties meet again soon to frame a solution that serves a common good
6556346 this shambles proves that this accident prone home secretary hasnt even got a grip of what goes on in her own building
6556347 we have been made aware of a serious breach of security at the offices of external contractors a full search has been conducted and both the police and information commisioner have been informed
6556348 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost it is vital that sensitive information is held securely at all times
6556349 the reason we went with that direction is aircell doesnt work for us going to mexico alaska or hawaii
6556350 we wanted a service that we could really offer anywhere
6556351 its huge from an operational opportunity for things you can do

6556353 the rudd government should bring in its main legislation to overturn the howard governments ir laws as soon as possible
6556354 in recent weeks there has been clear evidence that telstra rio tinto cochlear and other major companies are still exploiting the laws
6556355 hes a little frustrated he wants to pitch and in all likelihood it will be in the bullpen
6556356 he came to me and said hed do whatever we needed but before we know how he feels ive put it out of my mind
6556357 we tried to get scott feldman and vicente padilla through seven innings earlier in the week to help the bullpen but it didnt work out every day if you have to log 3 4 innings out of the bullpen theyre going to be running on fumes
6556358 you can see the starter start struggling giving up runs and letting guys on base and you can kind of tell you hope they get out of it but at the same time you have to be ready in case they call
6556359 if you havent pitched for a couple days its hard to get them in because you dont know if youre going to pitch that night
6556360 then if you dont pitch that night youre like well i cant really work out tomorrow because i might pitch tomorrow you really just dont know whats going on its a life of not knowing i guess
6556361 the hardest part is having to be sharp every single time you go in
6556362 you dont have innings to get settled in like a starter i speak from experience of doing both you come in and have to be ready to get outs because youre coming into situations where guys are on base youre expected to be sharp some days thats harder than others
6556363 that way if the phone rings youre never surprised youre never caught off guard youre ready thats when i can go out there and have fun
6556364 it must be said that it was usual for christians to allow themselves a rather purple rendering of the gardens and precious metals of paradise though usually not of the virgins so beloved of later romanticism

6556366 we wanted a service that we could really offer anywhere

6556379 given the significant rally in the u s dollar that has taken place over the last two and a half weeks i think the market has gotten a little bit over extended here and weve entered into a bit of a corrective phase
6556380 for the most part the main catalyst still comes back to price action in the commodity markets and with a substantial spike higher in oil today were seeing not only the u s dollar weaken off against the major currencies but thats been a benefit for the canadian dollar given the positive correlation between crude and the loonie
6556381 i think oil prices are finding some sort of base
6556382 and we do have some issues going on now the u s dollar declining again on the back of mortgage financiers freddie mac and fannie mae and this potential bailout
6556383 youre going to have everyone fearful of the unknown and fearful of bigger writedowns until we see some concrete evidence that the writedowns are slowing and some evidence that u s house price declines are slowing

6556394 andre does things a little differently from the young guys on the team andre likes to take the summers off and when i say off i mean off hes texted me a couple times to say hes happy with certain moves weve made but i havent talked to him he does not have any representation right now so we really dont know where hes at until he has representation we wont know
6556395 were not planning on slowing it down whenever you run you need a trailer and elton is a very good shooter from the elbow hed be a perfect guy to trail the break and sammy can really run with anyone the biggest change will be when the defense gets back and the run is stopped i think elton is going to especially help sammy in the half court with all the attention he draws hes going to help everyone by drawing doubles

6556414 t he word john mccain means a lot of different things but rich isnt one of them
6556415 mccains personal wealth makes him insensitive to the struggling economy is highly debatable

6556427 i used to run that way back in high school before i started to get all technical so i came here and said im just going to open up and let it fly and thats how it played out
6556428 but i believed i could do it and that is the first step in winning
6556429 i have been looking for this moment for four years
6556430 to run 44 flat early in the season made me know i was ready to run fast
6556431 i had nothing left i didnt give up lashawn just ran a better race today
6556432 im disappointed but i refuse to be ungrateful for something so few people have
6556433 i didnt race as much this season and probably could have been more race sharp
6556434 but i felt confident going into the race it just wasnt there
6556435 i wanted to show everyone im not just the guy who happened to be there
6556436 it hurts i was hoping to achieve a lot more everyone had to jump a seasons best or a national record so it was a tough competition really close all the way to the end but it wasnt enough so i just have to make do with a silver medal
6556437 i cant believe that im standing here at the olympic games with a silver medal and im really pissed ive come a long way last time i was not even in the mix to fight for a medal it would have taken an outdoor pb but ive been in such great form this year that i believed i could do it
6556438 oh man another four years but i will go on im a winner and i dont want to be content with silver im not happy about it but theres enough people in the world who can only dream about competing at the olympic games let along picking up a medal
6556439 we know from experience that photojournalists love macs and that our software is used by a huge segment of this industry
6556440 our goal is to get them to fall in love with aperture but were perfectly happy to have them using other tools as well
6556441 these guys are working under incredibly tight deadlines and there are situations where theyre panicking
6556442 we can really say weve made significant inroads in this segment
6556443 particularly in delivering a quick editing workflow that can truly keep up with these guys
6556444 you see what these guys really need and what they go through and as a product manager its been amazing to spend that much time absorbing how people respond to our current product its worth more than a big stack of market research papers just to be able to work with these photographers

6556451 the level of someone who attacks his enemies in calling them ass sniffers or pigfuckers is not more elevated than the level of someone who deems it necessary to cover the wall of a toilet with dirty drawings
6556452 this is no longer a parody but the non verbal version of a word of abuse parody desublimated into scatology with hindsight the shift from parody to scatology uncovers the true face of parody itself
6556453 the speed at which this thing fell apart was just unheard of
6556454 we tried to maintain the same programs we had the prior year that was a strong desire for us but still its difficult to cut 2 9 million from a 40 million budget and not have some things felt

6556473 we dont have a high incidence of crime in our forest preserves
6556474 we dont want vigilante type people and we dont want anybody getting hurt we want eyes and ears
6556475 ive been around animals all my life and never had an incident with them
6556476 there was some justice done but i dont think it was enough for what she did
6556477 this was an isolated incident caused by the emotional and physical abuse of her ex husband
6556478 she started it i regret doing what i did but thats no reason to stab and kill animals

6556483 she asked me if id read the book before it was published and make a promotional blurb
6556484 i read the book twice and fell in love with it but writing a blurb was harder than writing a song i said to myself if i cant do it here ill do it on a song
6556485 people keep asking me if its about someone i know but its basically a metaphor about why we lie to kids to keep them safe i started working on it when a young girl went missing in quebec it really affected me and it shaped the lyrics i wrote it as a poem and turn ed it into a song its one of the first songs that i recorded for the album
6556486 its an honour when people want to know the stories behind the songs
6556487 because i knew a little bit of information about them
6556488 i did two shows with ron in p e i and they were sold out both nights i really learned how to set up a song to give a little info about how you wrote it make the au dience feel like theyre part of the story

6556491 but removing potentially contaminated carcasses is essential to the health and well being of the public and in this case it was accomplished on july 18 less than one month from when the mission was assigned
6556492 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6556493 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6556494 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6556495 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6556496 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely
6556497 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed

6556603 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6556604 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6556605 what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6556606 the british taxpayer will be absolutely outraged if they are made to pick up the bill for compensation to serious criminals
6556607 charlie chaplin could do a better job running the home office than this labour government
6556608 after tonights revelation people will start wondering whether ministers are capable of keeping any data safe anywhere in the country
6556609 the government will no doubt seek to blame private contractors but the rash of data losses over the last two years confirm that there is something much more worrying at stake this government cannot keep any information safe
6556610 if this government cant keep data about criminals and the guilty safe why on earth should we trust them with the data of millions of innocent britons in an id card database

6556618 increasingly bloggers and maybe journos too simply dont want our help many bloggers particularly those who cover tech love to discover new things and experience them on their own unaided by pr
6556619 with more funding than brains whose management and investors believe that putting a pr firm on retainer is a smart move regardless of whether or not they have developed the company to the point where theres a real story to tell
6556620 that probably wouldnt be of interest to rubel and arrington anyway that pr firms are tasked with trying to publicize
6556621 to every a list blogger in the tech blogosphere is a less than worthwhile approach not because the odds of the approach working are slim but because the real impact of publicity via these blogs is often questionable
6556622 if pr firms clients dont have compelling stories to tell there really isnt much that a pr firm can do
6556623 its also important to note that technology isnt the only market in which pr firms operate

6556650 for years journalists have grumbled about the english libel laws and no one has listened but when a distant legislature passes a law of its own to counteract the intolerable effects of the british courts then its time to take notice the most startling recent legal story comes not from the high court but from albany where the new york state legislature has introduced the starkly named libel terrorism prevention act intended specifically to guard writers and publishers outside british jurisdiction from the terrors of english libel law
6556651 first the bca is able to sue because it is a
6556652 the claim form detailing the alleged libelous contents issued by the bca has not been published but one must presume that they are complaining that a direct or implied statement about the bca by simon singh has the effect of lowering their reputation rather than say the reputation of chiropractic generally
6556653 the british chiropractic association claims that their members can help treat children with colic sleeping and feeding problems frequent ear infections asthma and prolonged crying even though there is not a jot of evidence this organization is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments

6556675 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6556676 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6556677 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into

6556689 the campaign believes the story about mccains many houses is political gold
6556690 what is worse not knowing how many houses you own or thinking that there are 57 states in the union
6556691 if you ended up married to a multimillionaire heiress would you make her sell all she had and give it to the poor

6556714 he has worn a pair of 520 black leather ferragamo shoes on every recent campaign stop from a news conference with the dalai lama to a supermarket visit in bethlehem pa

6556742 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6556743 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6556744 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6556745 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6556746 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6556749 combining free tools from google technorati yahoo and other providers offers useful information but it is the analysis and interpretation of this data that is the valuable element and this takes time we are at the tipping point where for most large brands using free tools is no longer an option

6556780 its an amazing achievement and to be mentioned is something im very proud about and i cant believe he even said that
6556781 just to see him dance and carry on is truly inspirational and for him to have me in his mind is just so humbling

6556786 its just the pure adrenalin seeking mission of being the fastest man on earth and its a phenomenal achievement and were all very proud of him as well hayden said

6556797 i think theyve talked about using the hallways and some areas of the cafeteria around the cafeteria and the gym
6556798 i would like to think that since its a new school they would be prepared at this point in time
6556799 we knew this growth was going to be here two years ago
6556800 its just indicative of the large school systems that cant get their job done properly
6556801 youre the second person ive seen out here in a week
6556802 i parked a few houses up the road and walked along the water i was surprised to see someone like a morgue around here
6556803 so karen you must be enjoying the quiet sorry to interrupt it

6556805 hope you dont mind if i say how nice you look some women our age have a difficult time

6556807 same here i teach at a university but off for the summer im trying to write a book nothing very heavy just some erotic fiction about love between women
6556808 sounds like more fun than writing software im staying about 10 miles back towards the bridge at what seems like the only hotel left on the island me and about 10 other guests

6556822 let me run a comb through my hair not sure we have time to shower
6556823 can spam is not a strict liability statute there has to be intent for a violation to occur
6556824 affiliates are non agent independent contractors img has no control over them
6556825 because of the current administration everyone within the federal bureaucracy has been empowered to incredible arrogance theyve been encouraged to believe theyre right whether or not they are the jury told the government the people are tired of the status quo and frequent strong arm tactics like peter finch in network they said were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore but the prosecution refused to accept that
6556826 the government tried to make the case about adult but the jury didnt care
6556827 in its post trial filings the government argues that imgs provision of marketing materials to purecash one of imgs affiliates for use in commercial electronic mail messages justifies the entry of the proposed injunctive order
6556828 purecash did not send any of the 413 messages captured and used as evidence at trial
6556829 the argument seems to be that img knew or must have known that materials provided to purecash would make their way to imatrix and that img therefore initiated the five messages sent by imatrix
6556830 t he jury has already concluded that img did not initiate these five messages even if the court reweighs the evidence in light of plaintiffs post trial submissions the link between purecash and imatrix is so tenuous that it does not support a finding that img intentionally paid or induced imatrix to transmit the electronic mail messages at issue
6556831 the government has failed to show that img violated the can spam act of 2003
6556832 after listening to the evidence presented at trial the jury found that img had not initiated any of the 413 commercial electronic mail messages at issue in this case despite ample warning that defendant intended to challenge every assumption on which the governments claims were based plaintiff failed to provide evidence from which the tech savvy jury could conclude that img had procured the transmission of violative messages the court declines to second guess or otherwise alter the jurys findings
6556833 what the government set out to do it actually accomplished producers have gotten much tougher on their affiliates
6556834 backed off on further prosecutions under can spam prosecutions came to a screeching halt very quietly but they came to a screeching halt hopefully this case has called off the willy nilly institution of claims against all producers for the acts of affiliates
6556835 this was a proper and intellectually honest decision on the part of the court wholly supported by the facts and the decision of the jury
6556836 there was no error committed by the court that would prejudice the case against the government
6556837 img didnt spend anywhere near the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent by some of the companies that settled with the ftc to go to trial in this case not even close
6556838 28 u s c 1927 addresses counsels liability for excessive costs
6556839 its only applicable to federal cases but it makes the attorney personally liable
6556840 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
6556841 what a conservative local talk show in knoxville who whoulda thunk
6556842 didnt get a job mustve been the libruhls or the gays lost my food stamps mustve been those muslims or the blacks or the s

6556845 if theres one important lesson that can be drawn from the blockbuster performance of warner bros the dark knight its that audiences arent afraid of a comic book movie that takes a walk on the dark grim side
6556846 however the same cant necessarily be said for fox topper tom rothman
6556847 despite the fact that the gritty hugh jackman topped film was met with a giddy response at this years comic con jeff wells says that rothman is pressuring director gavin hood to make the movie more kid friendly
6556848 perhaps rothman has taken his fan letter from steven spielberg too much to heart but a child friendly wolverine feels less
6556849 by breaking them up into stations they experience more types of activities than they would during a whole group instruction time
6556850 by having many different types of activities we touch on different learning styles
6556851 this teaches kids how to be cooperative rely on each other and team building skills rely on later in life
6556852 you learn more stuff and you get to go around instead of sitting at a desk
6556853 its going to help me in life with people and jobs and stuff
6556854 i think in florida with our large organized school system the bureaucracy frustrates parents sometimes
6556855 we have to balance a budget attract customers thats our students and families and succeed on our merits or we fail as a business
6556856 we want them to enjoy learning and accept responsibility for learning

6556864 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
6556865 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6556866 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6556867 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach

6556874 the state budget process requires quick reaction which has shortened the discussion time possible
6556875 to assure that all concerned have adequate time to study the issue and that we have dealt directly and effectively with all concerns that have been raised during this difficult process i have agreed to the request by interim chancellor simek and the faculty senate to a lengthened period to consider programmatic cuts
6556876 i will ask the trustees to allow campus and system leadership additional time to seek faculty input and involvement

6556942 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
6556943 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
6556944 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
6556945 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
6556946 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
6556947 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

6556953 thats whats going to happen with that i dont care about how many threats shaw wants to pull well be doing a press conference if elitexc doesnt see the light here pretty soon and if shaw doesnt stop talking expletive
6556954 as far as nick diaz hes not the no 1 contender out there
6556955 to elitexc he is hes the number one for getting eyeballs to watch them theyre pushing on eyeballs versus a career move for a champion like kj kj is really not the one who gets anything out of the fight diaz does and so does proelite
6556956 but theres nothing in it for kj unless elitexc finally wakes up a little bit thats why well have a press conference i dont like to talk and beat a company thats already beat down im going to give them the benefit of the doubt hopefully theyll see the light
6556957 i would think eddie alvarez is the no 1 contender
6556958 hes definitely ranked higher than nick diaz kj already beat nick diaz
6556959 eddie alvarez is getting married but thats not our problem
6556960 he had a long layoff but hes making more money than the no 1 ranked expletive fighter in the world anderson silva or the same amount
6556961 and now anderson silva is getting bud light sponsorships from ufc president dana white handed down to him
6556962 who do you think negotiated that expletive contract a year and a half ago and if you look at my post it the one i negotiated was a 7 million deal for four years its nothing close to 100 000 and 100 000 as a win bonus as far as trying to bring in the mark dion negatives and stuff good luck show me any negatives on it and thats just a pitch elitexc can use but hey i know my expletive ive been around this sport a long long time
6556963 i dont bend over for nobody and i dont let my fighters do it
6556964 im not a booking agent i dont book my fighters and schmooze deals to work for the promoters i work for my fighters
6556965 i aint waiting until 5 oclock if elitexc officials are holding their breath then someones going to pass out

6557007 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6557008 this government is determined to support veterans and ex service personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6557009 we are seeking to better identify those at risk common contributing factors in recent cases the incidence of suicide in the ex service community and whether there is more that government agencies and the medical and allied health professions can do to support veterans under stress
6557010 while it remained behind the coalition as the preferred party on these issues its disadvantage was small and many more voters saw no difference between the major parties
6557011 there were clearly many factors that contributed to the australian labor partys 2007 election success but one was the partys increasing credibility with voters on national security issues
6557012 clearly the rise in the numbers seeing the us as a threat is motivated less by the belief that the us harbours military ambitions towards australia and more by anti american sentiment fostered by disenchantment with the fta free trade agreement and opposition to the iraq war

6557386 i have a remix of baby with richie sambora which is a rock joint
6557387 we creatively put our heads together i told him i wanted that talk box bon jovis is one of my favorite albums i thought the talk box on a couple of the songs was incredible livin on a prayer especially so i got richie to do it on the baby remix it sounds crazy then he did some vocals and he did some guitar solos so its good imma drop it out there shoot it out there and give people a chance to feel it we been talking about it having some good conversations
6557388 i thought his voice would do that song so much justice
6557389 it resonates it has that truthful energy to it that pain i wrote a song that basically its a letter to the president if i had an opportunity to have a conversation with him id pose a few questions to him in a respectful manner because i think that as a community we can get further with me asking him questions in a respectful manner than me talking crazy instead of me starting a bunch of ruckus i pose a bunch of questions that i thought were fairly intelligent to him and well see if theres a response that comes back the questions are relevant to our current president and at the same time could be posed to a president that comes in office after bush because none of the problems will be resolved theyre pretty timeless questions
6557390 dear mr president with all due respect wish we could have a conversation i would take a trip down to your residence and we would talk about the state of the nation

6557406 were lowering our third quarter 2008 estimates to reflect the difficult operating environment characterized by lower client related trading volumes and losses on hard to sell assets primarily mortgage securities
6557407 the markets have not yet indicated that the credit and mortgage markets are getting healthier
6557408 we expect third quarter 2008 results will be hampered by declining global equity markets further deterioration in mortgage assets and slower levels of corporate and institutional activity we assume no or negative earnings for the majority of firms in our universe this quarter

6557441 i have been involved with rock the vote since its inception and proud of the work they have done there are such critical issues facing our country from high gas prices to that we need to do more than just register to vote we need to get our friends registered too
6557442 the one on the right is the minnehaha window thats the older of the two made in 1893 by the tiffany studios in new york
6557443 the minnehaha window was actually commissioned by the state of minnesota and was used in the 1893 columbian exposition in chicago as part of the minnesota pavilion
6557444 one of the reasons duluth has such an incredible vast treasure of tiffany windows is the fact that anne weston lived here and designed windows for churches
6557445 in this case for the library and other buildings around duluth
6557446 you know obviously these are desperate times for the city of duluth and desperate measures are needed
6557447 im not totally enthused about losing such a beautiful treasure i refer to it as selling the family jewels
6557448 and some of the things that we have in our possession arent necessarily things that we should have in our possession
6557449 as an example christies will be doing an exclusive tiffany sale in new york later this year
6557450 it really is scary to think that they would do that
6557451 in the meeting room that we met in last night one of our board members looked at a picture on the wall its a big beautiful picture thats always been in city hall are they going to sell that off the chandeliers dont have a significance are they going to sell off the chandeliers theyre part of the building theyve been there forever
6557452 we will be at that council meeting and speak against it as will other organizations that care
6557453 and i hope citizens also come out for this to speak when all is said and done all we can do is voice our opinion hope that they would either take it off the block or at least table it and think about it
6557454 were being proactive here and are looking to make this business stronger by addressing redundancies and excess capacity
6557455 if obama wins people will be scared to death because he doesnt have much experience
6557456 we believe spirit is always available if called to help
6557457 say youre going to have a vote in congress on a key bill on social security wouldnt you think franklin roosevelt would be interested in what happens wouldnt you think eisenhower would come and help with decisions having to do with the war
6557458 id think lincoln would be very interested in how all this plays out i think hed want to bring the country together as he did in the civil war it was gray and blue then its red and blue now
6557459 come to be challenged by things that defy rationality kind of like this campaign has defied rationality
6557460 what worries me most is when politicians talk about their sense of destiny i dont think theres some great book of life that foretells all things and people especially politicians who think there is one tend to want to write that book themselves
6557461 i want to welcome you all to the 162nd season of the nys fair
6557462 its tough out there families are having a tough time making ends meet and with the price of fuel a lot more people are planning on staying close to home for vacations
6557463 i think thats probably true we didnt go on any vacations this year so thats probably true if the weather stays like this i think theyll get a lot of people
6557464 summer goes so quickly and definitely with the economy you have to cut back a little bit so we save up for the fair
6557465 well certainly everybodys watching their money we think the fair is very affordable weve had discounts on advance sale tickets and once you get to the fair theres all sorts of things you can do for free
6557466 i mean 20 they can ride the rides all day long shes got coupons for tullys we got deals on food and drinks
6557467 its easier to get significant improvement in womens running performance through drugs than it is with men
6557468 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6557469 clearly its a little more complex being ready for two contingencies as oppose to one but we can do that
6557470 they basically ask us to act in the way and behave in the way that we would in afghanistan so that they can you know sort of acclimate themselves to what they may encounter in afghanistan
6557471 i think my battalion and the brigade have set ourselves up to really support both so its not just a one month oh my goodness we got to go but we really looked at this as a yearlong operation to bring new people in get acclimated to the team build the team and get ready to move out
6557472 en cada uno de los 21 temas hubo patriotas que libraron batallas pero el resultado en medios fue la intensificaci n de espots del gobierno que nadie sabe de d nde sali el presupuesto y tratando al pueblo de m xico como si no tuviera inteligencia y el asunto no fuera lo bastante serio
6557473 por lo pronto yo les puedo adelantar esa ley no debe pasar ni ninguna versi n a medias de esa ley
6557474 ojal que no se apruebe en el congreso la ley la reacci n mostrar que la defensa que se ha hecho de esa iniciativa tiene motivaciones inconfesables que no tienen que ver con los aspectos productivos de la paraestatal de alternativas se requiere una propuesta como la que est n preparando los especialistas invitados por el fap y espero que sa sea la mejor
6557475 la estrategia del gobierno ha sido chantajear con una informaci n manipulada que son mentiras abiertas o verdades a medias que finalmente redundan en fortalecer las mentiras como el hecho de que ya no tenemos reservas que nos van a robar el petr leo en el golfo de m xico que no es una reforma constitucional pero que de hecho redunda en un cambio constitucional en el manejo de petr leo despu s de escuchar a los especialistas y que la iniciativa de ley no se sostiene persistir en ella s lo demuestra que se est actuando con consigna
6557476 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6557477 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6557478 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6557479 he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6557480 i only had the opportunity to get to know gene upshaw over the last year but during the short period of time that i knew him i found gene to be an engaging and candid individual
6557481 gene was a staunch advocate of nfl players rights and was concerned not only with the well being of his membership but for players in other professional sports as well
6557482 our condolences go out to genes family many friends and the nflpas staff and membership
6557483 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6557484 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6557485 i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6557486 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6557487 he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6557488 i cant imagine a world without genes larger than life presence

6557616 is part of this overall defence of islam jihad means to struggle to the utmost of ones capacity a man who exerts himself physically or mentally or spends his wealth in the way of allah is indeed engaged in jihad but in the language of the shariah this word is used particularly for a war that is waged solely in the name of allah against those who practise oppression as enemies of islam this supreme sacrifice of life devolves on all muslims if however a section of muslims offer themselves for the jihad the community as a whole is absolved of its responsibility but if none comes forward everybody is guilty this concession vanishes for the citizens of an islamic state when it is attacked by a non muslim power in that case everybody must come forward for the jihad if the country attacked has not enough strength to fight back then it is the religious duly of the neighbouring muslim countries to help her if even they fail then the muslims of the whole world must fight the common enemy in all such cases jihad is as much a primary duty of the muslims concerned as are the daily prayers or fasting one who shirks it is a sinner his very claim to being a muslim is doubtful he is a hypocrite whose lbadah and prayers are a sham a worthless hollow show of devotion

6557645 this is a more difficult patient to treat but were beginning to see a reward for this
6557646 if we were to look only at white populations with diabetes
6557647 i believe we would probably see similar results to what they saw in sweden
6557648 no reason to believe that the results differ among the eldest

6557670 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans

6557693 undoubtedly some evaluations of fair use will be more complicated than others
6557694 but in the majority of cases a consideration of fair use prior to issuing a takedown notice will not be so complicated as to jeopardize a copyright owners ability to respond rapidly to potential infringements the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice indeed it would be impossible to meet any of the requirements of section 512 c without doing so a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
6557695 given the shoot first and ask questions later approach some content owners take to the dmca notice process improper takedowns of non infringing fair uses are all too common were very pleased that judge fogel has put content owners on notice ignore fair use at your peril
6557696 we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security

6557722 above everything im here at the olympic games with my family i cant overlook that its been a great ride and its not over yet
6557723 toll credits are earned when a state toll authority or a private entity funds a capital highway investment with toll revenues from existing facilities
6557724 by using toll credits to substitute for the required non federal share on a federal aid project federal funding can effectively be increased to 100 percent
6557725 toll credits provide states with more flexibility in financing projects for example by using toll credits 1 federal aid projects can be advanced when matching funds are not available 2 state and local funds normally required for matching may then be directed to other transportation projects
6557726 language inserted into the transportation budget that says mdot cant start building a new international bridge without first coming back to the legislature for permission

6557762 the cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked good natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect
6557763 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6557764 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6557765 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6557766 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6557767 they should put their eyes out so they cant commit any more crimes
6557768 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
6557769 a spiderweb of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6557770 the feeling is hard to describe after all these years i never thought it would come down to this you give up hope
6557771 would say hi like nothing happened i wish i knew back then what i know today
6557772 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species
6557773 and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques
6557774 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
6557775 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6557776 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6557777 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6557778 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6557779 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6557780 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6557781 i told everyone about you and i have finished what you gave me to do
6557782 caused difficulty in the state and the pain will become even worse if we delay
6557783 it is time for everyone to compromise the republicans must step out of their ideological corner and the democrats must step out of their ideological corner
6557784 we have already borrowed and next year we will have the same budget problem and would have to raise taxes
6557785 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
6557786 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6557787 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
6557788 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
6557789 but police put up many obstacles to make it difficult
6557790 the fact that there were so many undercover police following them just made them go with the action urgently
6557791 we are concerned about any actions taken by the chinese that limit freedom of speech freedom of movement
6557792 there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head
6557793 who cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by this time youre nothing but a pack of cards at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off
6557794 then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could
6557795 conducting a pre planned routine visit to the black sea region to interact and exercise with our nato partners romania and bulgaria which is an important feature of our routine planning
6557796 when our community is challenged by decisions made and being made by our leaders
6557797 it is a challenge for everyone to respond in a way that reflects our commitment to peace it would be judicious for our government leaders to listen to what the youth have to say
6557798 among these activities have been training of madaris gurus who teach values formation to the youth there have been youth camps that provide muslim and christian youth as well as youth from different religious traditions to come together and forge bonds of friendship youth with talents for news writing have been trained to hone these skills so that they might use the press to promote the ideals of dialogue peace and harmony that are at the core of silsilahs vision and mission
6557799 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
6557800 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have sustained enormous damage in terms of manpower
6557801 pull out your trainers and weapons or we will escalate our co operation with syria and iran
6557802 going to war with russia is bad for your creditworthiness to put it mildly
6557803 is running deeper within the eu than was the case in the run up to iraq
6557804 all childhood memories are unreliable we construct narratives to justify what we now think
6557805 can you produce one economist to support the gas tax holiday
6557806 that doesnt matter because you can just look it up on the internet

6557815 e un cazzo in culo e accuse di arrivismo dubbi di qualunquismo son quello che mi resta
6557816 e lo vorrei perch non sono quando non ci sei
6557817 sono storie facili come quelle che ti raccontavano da piccolo e tu credevi vere com stato facile restare fermo immobile chiudendo gli occhi e rinunciando e anche se non c miele mi viene dolce e penso sempre lo stesso mi affogherei

6557821 no one obeys the speed limit except a motorised rickshaw
6557822 nor do i propose to defend the right to talk on a mobile while driving a car though i dont believe that is necessarily any more dangerous than the many other risky things that people do with their free hands while driving nose picking reading the paper studying the a z beating the children and so on
6557823 i have as much chance of becoming prime minister as of being decapitated by a frisbee or of finding elvis
6557824 i think i was once given cocaine but i sneezed so it didnt go up my nose in fact it may have been icing sugar
6557825 i dont see why people are so snooty about channel 5 it has some respectable documentaries about the second world war it also devotes considerable airtime to investigations into lap dancing and other related and vital subjects
6557826 had it been us i dont think we would necessarily have done the switcheroo with the girl with the braces
6557827 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
6557828 some hit is going to come from existing preferred shareholders
6557829 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6557830 while some companies will probably have some writedowns i dont think theres a widespread effect on the whole industry
6557831 we used to get a lot of calls complaining about it with some 15 or so people on a regular basis mostly south of the brooklyn army terminal but this year theres been no calls
6557832 there were various investigations and explanations but nothing conclusive although it might have been connected to construction work at the brooklyn army terminal bat that is now completed
6557833 most of our complaints came from people in two and three family houses on wakeman place near the bat and along colonial road and other streets into the 80s blocks
6557834 we even got calls from people in high rise buildings on the top floors
6557835 nobody has never ever found a conclusive explanation for the bay ridge hum
6557836 we do know that when construction was finished at the brooklyn army terminal this year we got no more complaints but who really knows

6557846 oh dont you remember me i was standing outside the dalai lamas in delhi
6557847 um i was there to you know get some maps and uh some postcards
6557848 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
6557849 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
6557850 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
6557851 this is one of those only in hollywood situations it could work out as long as reese doesnt visit jake on the set

6557859 i only turn 16 once so its going to be an awesome party with my favourite rides hanging out with friends fireworks and more
6557860 the best part of the party is were going to recognize some really cool kids from youth service america who are giving back to their community
6557861 thats so awesome because i think its really important for kids like us to volunteer
6557862 this is unprecedented the level of desperation the underhandedness and ugliness that went on
6557863 the channel seven deal involved the word exclusive so when channel nine approached i said my apologies
6557864 but it might be premature to say that weve seen the bottom as the markets focus could revert very quickly to demand deterioration
6557865 as prices drop saudi arabia may cut back on its recent increase in production which could halt the most recent price decline
6557866 i feel like i just completed a masters degree in kentucky studies
6557867 the fact that shes here in kentucky is a huge bonus
6557868 but the reason i called donna is because of her national reputation her clients are from all over the country and the world
6557869 what is the phrase iron fist inside the velvet glove shes not a screamer she is a quiet fun person to work with and very insightful
6557870 i dont like situations where i play an authoritarian role this is not a solo art form the great art in what we do exists in how we all work together
6557871 she took a higher and harder road and it took us to a higher and better point
6557872 getting donna was one of the smartest decisions we made i would hire her again in a heartbeat
6557873 the soundtrack is the heart and soul of these shows
6557874 you have the sense of the rhythm the tempo and the ride of the piece and you build the soundtrack according to the shape you imagine
6557875 she has the ability with words and music to orchestrate a story on the screen shes really one of the best in the business at doing that and her stories always get to you they touch you right in the heart
6557876 a lot of work is created quickly consumed quickly and discarded
6557877 stand on the brow of a hill overlooking gettysburg battlefield with the most highly respected civil war scholar james mcpherson and have him tell you the story
6557878 or to spend a day with three of the nations experts on the u s constitution and have the opportunity to ask them any question
6557879 there are equal number of advantages to staying the feeling of community and the real support that folks in the production community provide to each other
6557880 i am an inherently shy person who is frequently in positions where i cant be shy
6557881 rigorous and credible process for identifying the states most excellent teachers
6557882 if teachers want to link higher level skills and professional recognition to higher pay then we would readily examine that as part of our wages negotiations
6557883 the rudd government has also indicated it is interested in developing proposals to reward higher level teaching and wed welcome input by the commonwealth in this debate
6557884 we are simply concerned that the best teachers be recognised
6557885 the key to this system is that we actually identify the best teachers our emphasis is that the process is credible to both teachers and the community
6557886 we would like to be involved in investigating and discussing the idea of higher levels of accreditation as something that could be recognised by additional pay
6557887 it is critical for the government to put new money in for this because if there is no new money some teachers will be paid extra at the expense of others
6557888 it is like being in any kind of professional organisation
6557889 i only turn 16 once so its going to be an awesome party with my favorite rides hanging out with friends fireworks and more
6557890 the best part of the party is were going to recognize some really cool kids from youth service america who are giving back to their community
6557891 thats so awesome because i think its really important for kids like us to volunteer
6557892 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6557893 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6557894 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6557895 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6557896 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6557897 i bought it in the airport im taking it home for dinner

6557909 ive personally picked up houses that were facing foreclosure for 60 000 with a short sale then i was able to turn around and sell it for as much as 80 000 just a few weeks later thats 20 000 of profit for just five to seven hours of work
6557910 youve got to have a proven system and do it right to get those kind of results the fact is there have been a lot of people entering the foreclosure market without the right plan and they got burned weve made our share of mistakes along the way and we want to help people avoid making these same costly errors the foreclosure epidemic is a great opportunity for those who are properly informed

6557927 the illinois association of realtors r believes this tax credit is an extremely valuable tool for new homebuyers
6557928 while we all understand that we are in a challenging real estate market its important to recognize there are compelling reasons to buy especially for first time homebuyers in illinois we have low interest rates attractively priced homes and plentiful housing stock
6557929 in the belleville area for example i heard from a member who just had a few buyers come off the fence because of the incentive which is very encouraging
6557930 and in naperville i heard from a member whos been telling his first time buyers about the credit he said that some of his clients are excited about it simply because the financial perk will allow them to buy a few pieces of furniture for their new home

6558000 stephen strader said last week when the separation was announced he had been told by bentleys organization there was
6558001 i was told tuesday night they suspected something i got the news saturday morning todd told me he kept me out of the loop for my protection
6558002 three years ago he did the exact same thing he grew out of his relationship to his wife and transferred his affection to another thats the biggest frustration with us the bottom line is that he was traveling too much and not taking care of his wife and family like he should
6558003 one of the things we dont understand is how god uses people of flawed character people ask me why choose someone whos dysfunctional because god does it
6558004 this is a personal failing on todds part and he can recover from it its not an excuse to live a sloppy life but there should be some encouragement here god knew ahead of time todds frailty but chose to use him anyway
6558005 unfortunately some christians are going to be disappointed with god its a good lesson for christians to say maybe you had unrealistic expectations
6558006 miracles are still happening gods power is still present in the building

6558008 russia stocks slumped badly tuesday as concerns over the continuing georgia crisis fueled investor pessimism the dollar dominated rts index sank 5 2 percent to 1 685 6 points its lowest since november 2006 while the ruble denominated micex index dropped 6 percent to 1 361 54 points its steepest fall in almost seven months
6558009 with all thats occurring in russia these days im wondering how long itll be before western investment in that nation grinds to a halt
6558010 i confidently predict that at some point in the next 12 months russian equity will once again be the darling of the investment world it will probably be time to sell
6558011 where they still remained we unlike the forces of georgia offered them a corridor and gave the peaceful population the chance to leave
6558012 we were supposed to hope for the united states to do something no our soldiers were in iraq where is america now where
6558013 if moscow considers that georgian president mihkiel saakashvili should stand before the hague tribunal then let it first send to that court putin and his generals who are guilty in the mass murder of peaceful residents on the territory of the chechen republic this does not mean that i justify the actions of the georgian leadership i am simply stating facts
6558014 when the russian media speak about south ossetia they constantly use terms like genocide ethnic cleansing and mass murder but werent there similar and even worse actions in chechnya why did not russian investigators establish and turn over to the courts
6558015 where you can train and race practically the whole year round
6558016 they live in europe they dont leave there one race ends in italy and off they go to germany to poland to czechia to france while we ride one race and fly to russia right away we live there this is bad because we can not consolidate our athletic experience our level
6558017 the extent of foreign investment in the russian economy was 22 9 percent less in the first half of 2008 than for the first half of last year
6558018 in the opinion of specialists the latest geopolitical and economic shocks have only increased the negative attitudes of investors
6558019 as a result of the conflict in south ossetia the mechel affair and the scandal around tnk bp we have lowered our prediction on the inflow of foreign investment from 40 to 30 billion us dollars
6558020 after the beginning of the armed conflict western creditors cut and then closed credit limits for western companies thus it is possible to expect a reduction of the inflow of credit from abroad and an increase in their cost
6558021 it is early to speak about a serious blow to the economy of russia
6558022 well what about the americans in iraq its all right for them but not for us
6558023 two wrongs dont make a right and if you say americans behaviour is disgusting youve just lowered yourself to their level
6558024 west in russian gets 10 pages of hits where the article is to be found on the russian web
6558025 thank you interesting im curious is there anything good in russia links appreciated but you dont have to
6558026 russian people particularly those who wrote the pieces i sent you and are prepared to do something about the problems described therein
6558027 in order not to repeat history and get stuck in a rut you need to know history and russian newsweek some surprisingly balanced reporting that gets the tone just right in that it tells the truth but in such a way that there is a chance russophiles may not throw the mag away in disgust and actually read the thing

6558033 special rights does not mean you are special and have the right to do anything that pleases you it is a privilege attained by our malay forefathers for their future generations us it means we have to work hard so that we can justify the continuation of that privilege article 153 will have no meaning if the majority of malays are poor unintelligent exploited and downtrodden in their own country while only the lucky few are draped in wealth
6558034 on another note i do not presume that the nep should stay on forever but in the wake of the global economic uncertainty i humbly submitted that most malays are not ready to face nep less malaysia for not another 20 years we should start afresh with the new batch of malay children born today proper education balanced support from government fair rewards for success and punishment for failures should be installed then in 20 years time they are ready to compete in an equal playground

6558047 am trecut ca fiecare dintre noi prin astfel de experiente am vazut la parinti sau la cunostinte cum este sa muncesti la o intreprindere de stat nu stiam unde o sa ajung dar visul meu era sa lucrez intr un mediu corporatist cu toate ca nu stiam sigur ca se poate chema asa pe atunci de preferinta era sa ajung intr o companie americana cu sistem anglo saxon si asa s a si intamplat
6558048 cand au venit clientii in prima zi am crezut ca fug si imi dau demisia primisera sandwich uri gratuite si veneau in fuga spre casele de marcat
6558049 erau alte oportunitati de exemplu salariul care ajunsese deja peste al parintilor mei impreuna eram uimit de ce se intampla cu toate ca eram un simplu lucrator
6558050 studiile au avut o influenta asupra mea au adus elemente in plus dar cred ca mai presus de tot a contat experienta am acumulat foarte multe informatii de la oamenii din afara cand am deschis diferite businessuri mai mult ma las influentat atat in business cat si in viata personala de oamenii care conteaza pentru mine
6558051 mi a folosit foarte mult iar acum tot ce am invatat aplic in orice discutie pe care o port cu directorul de operatiuni sau cu cel de marketing pentru ca nu le stiu problemele doar instinctual ci le stiu practic
6558052 nu luasem eu fraiele in mana ideea de franciza este diferita de ideea de corporatie clasica unde ai tot sistemul la indemana aici am mai multa putere de decizie eu impreuna cu echipa pe care mi am format o suntem cei care aduc inovatiile
6558053 au fost multe nopti cand analizam trecerea dintr o parte in alta si zile in care nu stiam daca fac bine in ciuda faptului ca voiam sa fac pasul acesta acolo erai respectat te cunostea lumea tu ii cunosteai foarte bine stiai sistemul extraordinar de bine
6558054 oamenii se cunosc in piata stiam ca aici se va dezvolta afacerea burger king iar ei ma stiau pe mine mi s a facut oferta eu aveam incredere in marius nasta pentru ca este un specialist in acest domeniu am dat interviurile atat la nivel local cat si international pentru ca postul trebuia sa fie aprobat si de ei si am fost acceptat
6558055 pe 18 aprilie am deschis restaurantul si pe 19 aprilie m am casatorit totul era planificat nu puteam sa opresc lucrurile astea nu i puteam ruga pe cei de la baneasa sa devanseze sau sa amane deschiderea
6558056 am facut nunta in aer liber toata lumea era fericita dar eu am aflat ca a cedat un sprinkler instalatie pentru stingerea incendiilor n red din motive tehnice si a inundat restaurantul mi am luat sotia am rugat o sa ma duca pana acolo dar cand am ajuns angajatii deja strangeau apa totul s a rezolvat in doua ore iar noi am putut sa ne intoarcem si sa continuam petrecerea
6558057 cei de la burger king din germania nu credeau ca o sa deschidem restaurantul ei voiau sa inchidem restaurantul sa vedem ce trebuia reparat dar nu a fost nevoie pentru ca in doua ore totul era gata
6558058 este un moment foarte bun pentru aceasta industrie clientii incep foarte bine sa inteleaga ce inseamna un restaurant ce inseamna sa fii servit incep sa perceapa diferentele si mai ales cunosc din ce in ce mai bine brandurile internationale
6558059 nu prea este timp liber dar daca tii foarte mult la ceea ce vrei sa faci gasesti intotdeauna timp
6558060 nu ne am stabilit un target pentru noul kuga in acest an obiectivul nostru fiind de a ne consolida pozitia pe segmentul suv urilor am observat cum segmentul crossoverelor a crescut mai mult decat piata si cu siguranta vom fi in primii cinci vanzatori din segment

6558062 the value of claims settled on this segment also went up a great deal by 139 5 and reached 186 6 million ron 50 8 million euros

6558064 la sfarsitul primului semestru ponderea deficitului de cont curent a scazut la 15 2 din pib fata de 15 7 din pib cat reprezenta anualizat la finele lunii iunie 2007 existand sanse mari sa intre sub 14 la sfarsitul anului
6558065 putem spera in acest an sa doboram recordul psihologic de 10 mld euro in conditiile in care dupa primele sase luni valoarea investitiilor straine directe a fost de 4 8 mld euro iar seriile anuale de date ne arata ca in a doua jumatate a anului valoarea lor creste
6558066 cresterea economica nu este una sustenabila pe termen mediu indica clar supraincalzirea economiei si avand in vedere decalajul pib pozitiv din 2007 indica largirea in continuare a acestuia deci presiuni si mai mari in sensul cresterii preturilor cred ca o ajustare este inevitabila si ma astept la o crestere economica sub 4 in 2009 probabil ca in acest sens va contribui si politica monetara restrictiva pe langa incetinirea puternica din zona euro si impactul nefavorabil din partea pretului ridicat al petrolului
6558067 este o crestere economica peste potential ne va surprinde din nou cresterea economica sub aspectul sustenabilitatii este clar ca nu putem sa sustinem aceasta crestere pe termen lung
6558068 cresterea economica va fi si mai mare pe trimestrul trei si patru datorita agriculturii in general putand atinge chiar si un plus de 10
6558069 ca urmare a acestor cresteri inregistrate de pib inflatia va cobori in cea de a doua parte a anului pana la valoarea estimata de guvern de 6 5
6558070 pe aceasta ramura a crescut foarte mult cu 139 5 si valoarea daunelor platite atingand suma de 186 6 milioane de lei 50 8 mil

6558092 se observa unele scaderi dar este foarte greu sa ti dai seama de unde vine aceasta temperare a investitiilor in publicitate
6558093 investitiile nete nu au scazut au crescut aceasta discrepanta vine din necorelarea preturilor rate card cu cele nete pentru televiziune rate card ul nu mai este un instrument de vanzare avand in vedere ca peste 90 din clienti cumpara in functie de audienta
6558094 inca nu cred ca recesiunea mondiala isi face efectul la noi cat despre influente da este posibil ca bugetele de marketing ale unor companii multinationale sa se reduca pentru a suporta pierderile din alte tari insa nu cred ca aceste reduceri vor avea un impact semnificativ pentru intreaga piata fiind foarte usor contracarate de cresterile celorlalti clienti
6558095 pentru multi clienti romania este vazuta pe termen mediu doi ani calul de bataie care va acoperi stagnarile sau scaderile din alte tari
6558096 se observa unele scaderi dar este foarte greu sa ti dai seama de unde vine aceasta temperare a investitiilor in publicitate daca se datoreaza euro 2008 sau faptului ca pentru foarte multi advertiseri anul fiscal s a incheiat in iunie multi clienti sunt precauti in mai iunie si cheltuiesc foarte mult incepand cu septembrie octombrie in primul semestru a fost o precautie care se va confirma sau infirma in semestrul al doilea
6558097 este pentru prima data cand companii mari au oprit consumul de media vorbim de loreal unilever si p amp g care au cheltuit putin toti au declarat ca bugetul anual nu va fi afectat dar una peste alta unilever a mai avut un astfel de comportament acum trei ani iar loreal niciodata
6558098 evolutii de 30 40 asa cum cu prea mult optimism se asteptau unii actori ai pietei nu mai au loc pana la finele urmatorilor doi ani rata de crestere a pietei de publicitate se va incadra in maxim 6 12 ceea ce este inca foarte bine
6558099 temerile de recesiune se confirma economia romaniei nu mai creste moment in care clientii vor renunta sa si suplimenteze bugetele si poate chiar vor reduce din ele dar nu cred ca mai mult de 5 10 a doua ipoteza temerile nu se confirma economia si consumul continua sa creasca dar cu o rata mai mica din cauza majorarii ratelor dobanzii in acest caz s ar putea sa avem chiar suplimentari de bugete
6558100 anul trecut a fost sold out cererea pentru difuzarea de reclame este mai mare decat timpul alocat difuzarii de multe ori dar anul acesta ma astept sa nu mai fie asa
6558101 pana in prezent am incheiat contracte cu compania maghiara lavinamix care a achizitionat 10
6558102 sentimentul negativ inca se mentine in piata iar investitorii prefera sa stea intr o expectativa si sa vada ce se intampla cu pietele internationale nimeni nu intra la cumparare iar acest lucru duce la o scadere generala a pietei
6558103 ideea mi a venit citind despre aceasta business angels n red in presa economica interna si externa mi au placut si spiritul ei si statisticile referitoare la rata de succes
6558104 nu mi se pare nimic iesit din comun daca vedeam o crestere mai consistenta pe bursa puteam sa ne miram dar asa este continuarea unui trend descendent care a inceput acum un an deocamdata nu vad motive pentru intoarcerea tendintei generale de scadere
6558105 investitorii de rand au iesit cei mai sifonati din afacerea aceasta pentru ca ei si au pus cele mai mari sperante in bursa multi sunt decimati au pierderi de 30 40 in portofoliu si va trece un timp pana sa si recupereze pierderile sentimentul este de abandon total si ca nu exista speranta ca bursa sa recupereze increderea de care se bucura in trecut
6558106 actiunile s au ieftinit si acest lucru este de urmarit sa nu uitam ca si in america casele s au ieftinit dar nu vedem oamenii inghesuindu se sa cumpere pentru ca asteapta sa vada cand se vor termina aceste scaderi
6558107 momentul este unul prost chiar daca fundamental actiunile arata bine piata reactioneaza irational si in aceste conditii fundamentele nu au valoare sentimentul afara este ca aceasta criza a creditelor nu s a terminat si va mai face victime senzatia la nivel international este ca mai e pana la capatul tunelului si asta ne afecteaza si pe noi
6558108 bursa este ca o imagine stearsa si nebagata in seama care nu reflecta economia reala acum cand s au terminat fluxurile de bani de afara bursa isi arata valoarea daca nu vor fi adusi emitenti pe piata vom ajunge ultimii din regiune
6558109 noi nu avem niste preturi atat de mici pe cat ar vrea lumea sa creada nu suntem noi un el dorado al acestei piete sunt actiuni afara care sunt si mai ieftine si mai scumpe decat ale noastre si investitorii le prefera pe acestea pentru ca sunt mai dezvoltate si mai lichide noi cumparam anul trecut banci cu per n r pret raportat la profit pe actiune de 20 in asteptarea ca se va face 10 cu profitul pe care l vor face iar acum avem banci cu per de 10 in ideea ca se va face 20
6558110 voi merge pana la a da in judecata petrom si sa recuperez prejudiciul pentru ca se poate calcula cam cat ar fi putut sa vanda
6558111 exista un dezechilibru evident de masa si de forta pe piata locala de telefonie mobila in conditiile in care vodafone si orange detin circa 90 din utilizatorii din piata stabilirea corecta a unor tarife de interconectare este vitala pentru ca ceilalti operatori sa nu fie afectati
6558112 nu am mai avut o astfel de crestere economica de cel putin doua decenii mi e foarte greu sa fac o comparatie cu perioada de dinainte de 89 dar de cand am introdus indicatorul pib acestea sunt niveluri record
6558113 in deceniul urmator romania ar putea sa ajunga si din punct de vedere economic pe pozitia pe care o are din punct de vedere demografic in europa
6558114 este o crestere care beneficiaza de comparatia favorabila cu anul agricol 2007 cresterea din constructii si servicii si intr o masura mai mica cea din industrie reflecta conditiile monetare laxe din 2007 si mai ales relaxarea conditiilor de creditare nu este o crestere sustenabila
6558115 obiectivul meu este sa mi fac din asta o ocupatie full time si sa castig destul pentru a putea trai

6558117 the concept of luxury travel and the hotel experience that affluent consumers seek has evolved over the years and even now continues to redefine itself
6558118 what remains constant about our best of the best award recipients is their spirited enthusiasm singular passion for delivering an unparalleled experience and an unwavering commitment to serving both the client and our member travel agencies we are proud to recognize those hotels that are stand outs in particular areas of excellence
6558119 analiza concentrarii economice efectuata de catre consiliul concurentei a ilustrat faptul ca aceasta operatiune nu are ca efect crearea sau consolidarea unei pozitii dominante care sa conduca la restrangerea inlaturarea sau denaturarea semnificativa a concurentei pe pietele pe care acestea isi desfasoara activitatea
6558120 net investments have not gone down but up this discrepancy comes from a lack of correlation between rate card prices and net ones for television rate card is no longer a sales tool as over 90 of clients are buying depending on the audience

6558128 sunt toate gandurile demne de a fi protejate nu exista idei nepotrivite pentru a fi exprimate idei demente obscene distructive oare toate ipotezele se situeaza la acelasi nivel oricat de marsave sau de prostesti ar fi ele pentru a fi acceptate cu o reverenta fiindca sunt avansate de un tampit de profesor este lipsa cenzurii o virtute atat de mare incat sa poata denunta orice tip de cenzura ca fiind lipsita de spiritul libertatii umane

6558131 este un film politist psihologic despre un detectiv care investigheaza o serie de crime brutale si sfidatoare el nu reprezinta o portretizare negativa a lesbienelor si a bisexualilor
6558132 nu am interzis niciodata studiourilor sa prezinte homosexuali si lesbiene ca personaje negative dar de ce nu prezinta un homosexual politist capabil si echilibrat

6558134 maneaua e o alta forma apartinand exclusiv tiganilor din romania forma insasi e de certa origine turca provenind la origine de la strigatele turcescul mani vanzatorilor stradali si evoluand in turcia intr o forma usoara clasica si improvizatorica este clar ca maneaua a fost populara in bogatul mediu greco turc al marilor orase mai cu seama in mahalalele din jurul bucurestilor prezenta acestui ritm in romania este unica intre tiganii oraseni nu apare in niciuna din muzicile folclorice sau regionale din vreo alta regiune a tarii

6558151 chris carney obviously thinks hes a washington big shot now
6558152 first he abandoned his promise to represent pennsylvania valued by voting with nancy pelosi and the liberals 90 percent of the time now he refuses to even show enough respect for voters to defend his record in open and honest debates carney is a sorry excuse for a congressman trying to win an election behind negative attacks instead of debates
6558153 when peak harvest time is over farmers cant afford to pay labor to go back into the field for leftover produce
6558154 i was encouraged by the participation and enthusiasm of the students faculty and staff
6558155 the service dawgs offered students a fresh way to understand how they could help fight hunger
6558156 many students have worked on food drives and volunteered for food pantries but why not get them out in the field picking pulling and lifting so healthy food can get to local food pantries
6558157 a large number of hands working together in a short amount of time achieved something important
6558158 those melons were delivered to food pantries within 24 hours of being gleaned and people in need were able to enjoy a little bit of luxury they could not afford
6558159 i delivered for meals on wheels back home and was a girl scout
6558160 what impressed me the most about the experience is the number of students who signed up or who decided to walk up that day
6558161 they were incoming freshmen who did not know one another and didnt have friends to ask ahead of time but they came anyway
6558162 we want to help them further their education by making this connection

6558171 we were the first farm in mississippi louisiana and alabama to be certified in food safety
6558172 we follow the good agriculture practices guidelines in planting harvesting growing packing and shipping
6558173 i just want quality food there is still that chance that something could happen so this person oversees chlorine baths for equipment checks for open wounds on the workers hands and does other things like that
6558174 the healthier the plants the less likely they are to get disease
6558175 well more than half of each days harvest is shipped out the same day it is picked all but watermelons require cooling which can extend the shelf life three to four days
6558176 people have gotten used to not seeing spots in a retail store
6558177 we have 400 to 500 cars out here on opening day customers come from a 100 to 150 mile radius to pick fresh produce
6558178 after the crop is harvested we call them to come pick what is left of the cabbages or cucumbers to give to food banks

6558215 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6558216 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6558217 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6558218 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6558219 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6558246 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6558247 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6558248 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6558249 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6558250 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6558251 the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
6558252 this new test will eliminate a lot of the guesswork
6558253 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism
6558254 under that scenario every minute counts in providing treatment or preventing disease spread
6558255 do you think we should meet sometime sober i really like you

6558268 if obama is trying to court women particularly women from hillarys camp he should be wary of using larry summers as a surrogate it would potentially cause concerns and hesitation
6558269 certainly there are better people in the party and for him to surround himself with who dont have a negative attitude toward women and their abilities
6558270 the concept of luxury travel and the hotel experience that affluent consumers seek has evolved over the years and even now continues to redefine itself
6558271 what remains constant about our best of the best award recipients is their spirited enthusiasm singular passion for delivering an unparalleled experience and an unwavering commitment to serving both the client and our member travel agencies we are proud to recognize those hotels that are stand outs in particular areas of excellence
6558272 uit constante gesprekken tussen fortis en specialisten van de europese commissie was al duidelijk dat de kans op uitstel erg klein was dus hebben we geen formeel verzoek tot uitstel ingediend en zijn we doorgegaan met wat volgens ons de beste oplossing was
6558273 het smeken voor uitstel was slechts beeldspraak om aan te geven dat we hard gezocht hebben naar een andere oplossing
6558274 de meest waarde kan gecreeerd worden door het bedrijf te herstellen
6558275 laat het duidelijk zijn waar het zwaartepunt ligt de pijlen zijn erop gericht heijmans uit het slop te halen daarvoor ben ik binnengehaald en dat is mijn ambitie om de activiteiten weer goed renderend en kansrijk te maken
6558276 dan moet je ondernemer genoeg zijn om dat te zien
6558277 dat zijn dan gedachten die aandeelhouders nog niet met mij hebben gedeeld
6558278 ik zal mijn eigen energie ten volle inzetten om het vertrouwen van aandeelhouders terug te winnen
6558279 als een van de eerste punten op de lijst staat
6558280 momenteel is het inderdaad moeilijk om van infra chocola te maken
6558281 maar nederland is nog lang niet af je moet hierbij niet denken in termen van kwartalen of een halfjaar maar in olympische periodes op de lange termijn zie ik zeker potentie bij wegenbouw
6558282 het gaat niet alleen om goed werk leveren maar ook om het contractueel goed regelen
6558283 we hebben ervan geleerd want anders zouden we nu nog steeds op dezelfde manier projecten aannemen maar bij dit soort projecten is de wet van murphy van kracht als er iets fout gaat dan gaat ook alles fout
6558284 dat betekent dat ze in het tweede halfjaar boven die 8 moeten uitkomen
6558285 we zien natuurlijk ook dat er druk op de markt is in verschillende sectoren onder andere in de vastgoedmarkt in het verenigd koninkrijk en de consumentenmarkt in duitsland
6558286 maar wij zitten overwegend in tragere minder cyclische sectoren zoals transport en krijgen onze opdrachten vooral van overheden
6558287 we krijgen veel opdrachten voor het vernieuwen van installaties in bestaande oude gebouwen die moeten worden vervangen door energiebesparende installaties maar ook voor nieuwe duurzame fabrieken bijvoorbeeld in oost europa
6558288 daarentegen doen we relatief weinig grote prestigeprojecten zoals wolkenkrabbers en dat is juist het soort projecten dat kan worden uitgesteld als er geen geld voor is
6558289 meer dan 50 van onze activiteiten in het vk betreffen water
6558290 en britse waterbedrijven gaan de komende jaren in totaal gbp20 mrd investeren
6558291 als er zich echt grote mogelijkheden voor investeringen voordoen maar dat zal niet op korte termijn zijn dan staat de weg naar de aandeelhouders nog steeds open
6558292 omdat de prijs die we voor sno betaald hebben minder dan 10 van de jaaromzet van ajax is hoeven we de overnameprijs niet bekend te maken
6558293 met deze overeenkomst gaan we de samenwerking verdiepen met een van de belangrijkste bedrijven die ooit uit de tu delft zijn ontstaan
6558294 there should be one and preferable only one obvious way to do it
6558295 how we view history in this country how it is taught in schools and how to engage people with the subject

6558297 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
6558298 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
6558299 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
6558300 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
6558301 de resultaten van heijmans zijn slecht maar het meest verbijsterend zijn de grote verliezen bij infra en in belgie
6558302 naast het verwachte verlies bij de bouwactiviteiten in nederland zien we nu ook een verlies bij de infra divisie in nederland en in belgie
6558303 hoewel de resultaten over de eerste helft tegenvallen zijn we positief verrast door de resultaten van de vastgoeddivisie in nederland
6558304 echter dit wordt compleet overschaduwd door de slechte prestaties bij de onderdelen bouw en infra en nederland en de belgische activiteiten
6558305 we blijven alleen research amp development doen we worden in deze sector geen makelaar
6558306 toen betaalde je tien keer het bedrijfsresultaat maar dat is echte verleden tijd
6558307 het slechtste wat in je als tmc onder de huidige omstandigheden kunt doen is niet investeren in sales
6558308 we moeten nog dichter op onze klanten zitten opdat we nog sneller en beter weten wat ze van plan zijn en met wie we zien dat onze vier grootste klanten de behoefte hebben om meer zaken te doen met minder partijen en wij denken dat wij daar bij horen daarbij komt dat we ons genoodzaakt zien om onze risicos over meerdere opdrachtgevers te spreiden een verlangen dat we ook bij onze klanten waarnemen
6558309 onze interesse gaat vooral ook uit naar overnamekandidaten die niet gevoelig zijn voor schommelingen daarin daarnaast zit tmc met zijn werkondernemers dicht bij de kernactiviteiten van zijn opdrachtgevers en we moeten daar in de huidige markt nog dichter op komen te zitten
6558310 misschien dat we wat eerder moeten beginnen met de onderhandelingen voor 2009
6558311 er blijft een groot tekort aan technisch hoogopgeleid personeel in combinatie met de vergrijzing en de behoefte aan goede gezondheidszorg maken wij ons geen zorgen over de vraag naar onze mensen
6558312 de werking van de vliegbelasting zal worden geevalueerd wanneer daarmee voldoende ervaring is opgedaan onder meer zal worden gekeken naar de effecten en de lasten die de maatregel met zich meebrengt
6558313 deze maatregel dreigt in combinatie met de stijgende beveiligingskosten de concurrentiepositie van schiphol nadelig te beinvloeden
6558314 deze maatregel dreigt in combinatie met de stijgende beveilingingskosten de concurrentiepositie van schiphol nadelig te beinvloeden

6558317 in 2007 waren de grote orders immers met name in de eerste helft gerealiseerd terwijl de nadruk van licentieverkopen normaal gesproken in de tweede helft van het jaar ligt
6558318 gebaseerd op het sterke orderboek verwacht ik dat deze trend doorzet
6558319 dat de dubbelcijferige groei van de bezoekers alweer een tijd aanhoudt verrast ons
6558320 de cijfers van heijmans over het eerste halfjaar van 2008 zijn ronduit beroerd
6558321 infra belgie valt nu ook ineens erg tegen de cijfers zijn lager dan verwacht en ze laten hun verwachting voor 2008 los
6558322 waar het eerder steeds de bouwdivisie was die teleurstelde is het nu vooral infra dat negatief verrast ook belgie valt tegen
6558323 de geruchten over de nationalisering van hypotheekgiganten fannie mae en freddie mac houden aandelen van hypotheekverstrekkers onaantrekkelijk samen met een dalende dollarkoers en daarmee gepaard gaande steun voor grondstoffenprijzen leidt dat tot een defensieve aandelenhandel
6558324 we moeten de wanhoop niet overdrijven gezien het feit dat veel fondsmanagers nog op hun post zitten is er een kans dat de markt wordt over geanaliseerd
6558325 logo depois de recuperar a motocicleta conseguimos identificar os bandidos s esper vamos a melhor oportunidade para prend los isto aconteceu na noite de quarta feira quando conseguimos localizar a casa onde estavam
6558326 edson assumiu que foi ele quem atirou na v tima porque ela reagiu e n o queria entregar a moto
6558327 com os antecedentes e os elementos colhidos at agora pela investiga o requeri a pris o preventiva da dupla e o juiz a concedeu com isso eles ficam presos at defini o da justi a
6558328 het zal u duidelijk zijn dat we bij heijmans in het slop zitten
6558329 maar het is nog te vroeg om concreet te kunnen zeggen dit zijn de maatregelen
6558330 de diverse aspecten hebben onze aandacht dat kunnen we verzekeren het gevoel van urgentie is er wel maar daarvoor moet u ons wel de tijd gunnen
6558331 we zijn op de verliesgevende activiteiten gesprongen in de tweede helft van het jaar zullen er plannen bekendgemaakt worden om die het hoofd te kunnen bieden
6558332 wheres the jail time for lindsay lohan britney spears and whatever other white people you want to mention how about o j r kelly kobe bryant stop playing the race card

6558334 rip your arm off and hit you in the face with it with comedy
6558335 ik ben zeer verheugd dat we alle aspecten van de technische review positief hebben doorlopen wat een significante prestatie is we zijn nu in afwachting van de terugkoppeling van loncin en zullen verdere actie ondernemen op de ontvangen interesse van chinese autofabrikanten
6558336 we dont want to put anyone at risk due to tropical storm fay
6558337 game developer grey ghost id call it murky rough and majestic leipzig games convention because were a stupid b poor c lazy and d unfit for public consumption we did intend to be but things fall apart the centre of pc game blogging cannot hold
6558338 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6558339 president musharraf was a good ally in the war on terror he pulled pakistan away from the brink of extremism
6558340 i think people forget where pakistan was in 2001 supporting the taliban not aggressive against al qaeda and a lot was achieved under his musharraf s rule
6558341 and perhaps he also took off his uniform and helped to smooth the path to civilian democratic rule in pakistan now the democratically elected government of pakistan does have to pay attention to this terrible militant threat
6558342 president bush called prime minister yousaf raza gilani and congratulated him over the smooth transition of power
6558343 if the bush administration invests some serious diplomatic energy on courting him
6558344 this is my understanding based on conversations with people in pakistan that he s likely to leave the country and that a possible immediate destination may be dubai and then eventually may be new mexico in the united states
6558345 i am spending time with my family especially with my mother i am playing tennis and enjoying it thoroughly i am not going anywhere and all this talk of me leaving is rubbish
6558346 if the bush administration invests some serious diplomatic energy on courting him
6558347 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters
6558348 to realize our goal of registering 2 million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are and theres no doubt in our minds that many are on xbox 360 and xbox live
6558349 i have become all things to all men so that by all possible means i might save some i do all this for the sake of the gospel that i may share in its blessings
6558350 this is the first day of the rest of my evangelizing life
6558351 the riches jesus promises in heaven far exceed any amount of money we can find on earth god bless you
6558352 this is the first day of the rest of my evangelizing life
6558353 the riches jesus promises in heaven far exceed any amount of money we can find on earth god bless you
6558354 well i would take it if it was real i wish it was
6558355 when was the last time a christian has witnessed to you
6558356 had refused to join my call to take out osama bin laden across the afghan border and instead spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6558357 the departure of president musharraf has given the us an opportunity to move away from a foreign policy focused on one person and to a pakistan policy
6558358 is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
6558359 the double whammy of financial sector drama and rising crude prices are once again marginalising the bulls
6558360 i hate getting attatched to people because to me were all alone in the end anyway
6558361 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6558362 this government is determined to support veterans and ex service personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6558363 we are seeking to better identify those at risk common contributing factors in recent cases the incidence of suicide in the ex service community and whether there is more that government agencies and the medical and allied health professions can do to support veterans under stress
6558364 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6558365 it has all the essential elements that appeal to you at a slightly deeper level its hand to hand combat the action is bell to bell you cannot back down for a second therefore the kind of bravery this sport requires as a standard is different from other sports besides character and courage under fire boxing requires the attributes of other sports too fitness agility reflex it needs a big heart
6558366 boxing has a code of conduct you conduct yourself in a specific way
6558367 they feed off of each other heaps of times they have been down they motivate each other its the kind of sport in which you get weeded out of the system if you dont have a big heart boxers are surprisingly sensitive people caring compassionate its a different brotherhood whatever cost to self they will help their friends
6558368 if jeetu or one of the others needs him he will drop everything these guys cant be selfish its what i call the old school this is why they are still very grounded very down to earth they wont get carried away
6558369 in a world where morals and structure and responsibility are getting eroded these guys lead the way in showing how to conduct yourself
6558370 trainings about to start a senior will find hes forgotten say his wrist guard a junior will be sent to the dorms to fetch it its a way of saying when you are here you will have certain privileges and certain responsibilities
6558371 if akhil were to say to jeetu jitender dont play your bout on a certain day there wouldnt be a discussion because jeetu believes akhil knows whats best for him it transcends logic
6558372 when you get on the bus the atmosphere transcends competition you wont have competitors communicating with each other in other sports when youve spilt a little blood with each other the ice is broken
6558373 in bhiwani guys are putting down cricket bats and picking up boxing gloves
6558374 if sport embodies something greater than self cricket has been that sport for most of india but in this environment the same sentiments exist for boxing it gives them a sense of achievement and self worth that they may not get in other areas of life
6558375 they help each other out akhil whatever he has materially and intellectually he is more than happy to part with hes continually giving of himself he will make an excellent coach one day it is a lot easier to follow the captain into battle when hes led the way by example thats what a lot of young kids need each day
6558376 smart hard work and luck if you dont have both cannot achieve he didnt have luck
6558377 after that he cared for me like a father he would even wash my clothes he gave me money he is the single most important person in getting me here i didnt have a bike hed take me 7 km each way to practice
6558378 they are holding a meeting what objections have you got
6558379 god will do justice and the community will benefit from your sons sacrifices
6558380 they have arrested many innocent muslims without proof we are being targeted and the government does not care about our community
6558381 why dont they share the proof why do they arrest him from the house and claim to have arrested him from lucknow how can they hand over the innocent poor young man a namazi to the policemen of narendra modi
6558382 i myself was victimised and put behind the bar for frivolous reasons and hence aware of the trend and pain
6558383 but it might be premature to say that weve seen the bottom as the markets focus could revert very quickly to demand deterioration
6558384 as prices drop saudi arabia may cut back on its recent increase in production which could halt the most recent price decline

6558387 all the other dogs around here are his offspring and now they bully him but he doesnt mind it too much he has the nature of a sage he understands everything we say to him
6558388 of course in our book of hebrews it tells us that there is fault with the first covenant and it is passing away and we believe the veil was rent in twain when jesus was crucified signifying the death of judaism
6558389 if you went into the holiest of holies before christ not being a priest you would immediately be struck down in the presence of god
6558390 after christ wherever your holiest of holies is you could go there and fornicate and god wouldnt strike you down because the temple is christ
6558391 if you went into the holiest of holies before christ not being a priest you would immediately be struck down in the presence of god
6558392 after christ wherever your holiest of holies is you could go there and fornicate and god wouldnt strike you down because the temple is christ just another fanatic paperback

6558406 one of the countrys priorities for the next 10 years
6558407 in accordance with a program we have developed by 2021 iran is to become the leading space power in the region
6558408 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends mixed signals and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work
6558409 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6558410 the prime minister says what iraq and her people now need is time not a timetable they seek our patience not political posturing they require resolve not our retreat were going to succeed in iraq if given a chance liberty will succeed every time and liberty will help yield the peace we need
6558411 theres a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders thats why i strongly rejected an artificial timetable of withdrawal its kind of like an arbitrary thing you know we will decide in the halls of congress how to conduct our affairs in iraq based upon polls and politics and were going to impose this on people as opposed to listening to our commanders and our diplomats and listening to the iraqis for that matter
6558412 in the area of security cooperation the president and the prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals
6558413 well we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in in such an agreement and i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger

6558439 people get to learn about cpr and how to help raise money for the american heart association
6558440 it can bring awareness to different types of heart disease and what the community can do to get involved on local levels
6558441 because he doesnt have one and i think he will like it
6558442 he and his colleagues have developed what they jokingly call the
6558443 a very smart blog if youre trying to separate the demagogic attacks on nclb from the serious criticism this is the site to read
6558444 full of very lively short items and is always on top of the news he gets extra points for skewering my high school rating system
6558445 a daily dose of information from the education policy world blended with a shot of attitude and a dash of humor
6558446 designed to cut through the fog and direct specialists and non specialists alike to the center of the liveliest and most politically relevant debates on the future of our schools
6558447 peppered with smart and witty comments on the education news of the day

6558450 penetrating analysis in a lively style on a wide range of issues
6558451 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6558452 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6558453 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6558454 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6558455 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
6558456 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
6558457 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
6558458 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies
6558459 the holy grail of enzyme catalysis and the ultimate manifestation of understanding of this process is the ability to design enzymes
6558460 what really fits is the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme active site to the substrate charges at the so called transition state where the bonds are halfway to being broken
6558461 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6558462 dude youre awesome changed my life ill tell everyone else to use you well thanks
6558463 the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
6558464 this new test will eliminate a lot of the guesswork
6558465 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism
6558466 under that scenario every minute counts in providing treatment or preventing disease spread
6558467 id really like to show her the house i build for henry the newest frog she found
6558468 what would jesus do would your spiritual heroes great christ like role models like frances of rome give up their cheeseburgers
6558469 come on they came over totally unexpectedly jesus wants you to have the cheeseburger ask them if they want to split the extra one or something they have to understand you cant feed them a nice dinner with five seconds notice nobody would expect you to do that
6558470 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6558471 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6558472 the intestine may be an ideal site for msc therapy given its rapid ability to regrow tissue and its extensive local supply of lymph nodes and the route by which the cells were administered may have ensured a greater amount of engraftment in gut associated lymph nodes
6558473 before we can think about testing this approach in patients we need to know more about long term effects of msc infusion including immunosuppressive effects and gain more understanding of how mscs modulate immune cell activity in more realistic models of inflammatory bowel disease
6558474 we saw the film recently in london and marc forster daniel craig and the entire team at eon have truly delivered another extraordinary bond adventure
6558475 quantum of solace is a seamless continuation of the storyline that began with the last film we believe november 14th is a great date that allows us to play straight through thanksgiving and right into christmas the bond films have a long history of entertaining audiences in this holiday corridor going back to goldeneye in 1995 the studio enjoyed tremendous success opening casino royale in north america on november 17 2006 and we believe this decision will give the public a wider opportunity to see the film over the holiday
6558476 well i guess its time to go dig a hole

6558479 jindal said wednesday that discrimination is prohibited under state and federal laws and he doesnt want to create more special categories by executive order
6558480 he also said he worried it could cause problems with faith based organizations ability to contract with the state
6558481 were not going to renew it that shouldnt come as a surprise
6558482 governor jindal is proposing an unacceptable step backwards for louisiana
6558483 our states proud history of union justice confidence is undermined when our public leaders strip our families of basic protections we should all enjoy there is nothing pro family about rolling back protections for some families
6558484 allowing louisianas anti discrimination order to expire would mean the end of any legal protection for gay citizens in the state
6558485 by not renewing this critically important measure governor jindal would remove the welcome mat from louisianas front door it is imperative and urgent that the governor not allow the states commitment to non discrimination to expire
6558486 these were the people that were writing me off and going to the diary room because it was all too difficult having a blind person dance but i was having none of it because i was quite capable of learning all the moves if they were shown to me everybodys got different attitudes to blindness in the real world and i knew they would here through all the tasks ive tried my best on all of them ive been here 11 weeks so i dont know why that kind of thinking is still there but obviously it is

6558497 people want change in america we all know that and very legitimately so
6558498 lobbyists dont come to my office because they know theyre not going to be an earmark they know theyre not going to get a pork barrel project senator obamas gotten lots of em

6558502 i am quite impressed that i have in my laboratory the first configuration of its kind in the maldi ltq orbitrap xl
6558503 its performance has already proven to be terrific this instrument combines the robustness and high throughput capabilities of maldi with the sensitivity of the linear trap and the high mass accuracy and resolution of the orbitrap the maldi ltq orbitrap xl is perfectly suited for characterizing protein complexes after the initial ms and ms ms analyses and identifications the samples can be preserved on the maldi target to pursue new interesting directions revealed by the first analyses
6558504 white house missing as many as 225 days of e mail
6558505 who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
6558506 on the portico of the mccain estate in sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses
6558507 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
6558508 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6558509 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6558510 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6558511 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6558512 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
6558513 i ordered loads of prizes alcohol cigarettes and one banana
6558514 the development of animal free coating methods for hescs still remains a major challenge due to the complexity of ecms and insufficient knowledge about how hescs control cell cell and cell ecm interactions
6558515 until now it was generally assumed that the hesc colony formation was pivotal for maintaining pluripotency
6558516 but we show that pluripotency can be retained independent of close cell cell contact
6558517 his work is certainly an important step forward in both understanding signal transduction pathways in stem cells and in the development of an improved methodology for culturing stem cells
6558518 we found that the growth of the hescs under this novel culture condition was almost identical to the growth of hescs on matrigel coated culture plates with no compromise in pluripotency
6558519 our research goal is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying unique biological functions of pluripotent stem cells and to translate the obtained knowledge into future medical applications
6558520 our next step is to produce new animal free ips cell lines
6558521 if one were to agree with fras opinion there are barely any legal grounds left for claiming that any inequality in social life should not be treated as discriminatory

6558529 palliative care should be an integral part of the support given to patients and their families and carers during the last months days and hours of their lives
6558530 in many areas of scotland the voluntary sector and the health service provide excellent and much appreciated care but access to good quality palliative care varies across the country
6558531 there are many examples across the country of nhs boards and the voluntary sector working together to improve services
6558532 this is a process that is already under way but theres no doubt we have to accelerate that progress

6558535 a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of states as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted
6558536 the doctrine of separation of powers calls for the departments being left alone to discharge their duties and as they see fit
6558537 more specifically as long as any proposed amendment is still unacted on by it there is no room for the interposition of judicial oversight

6558546 there are still unconfirmed reports that the left engine of the plane had caught fire while taking off
6558547 theres no up side to being adversarial in these kind of deals youve just got to stay positive and youve got to focus on whos here and have trust and faith in the people that are working on getting everything done
6558548 no one gets 100 percent of what they would like to happen but me and my agent are happy
6558549 of course there were heated debates on the phone but no one attacked publicly i still feel the same way about this organization as i did last year the last game of the season
6558550 when youre talking about this kind of money a lot of people cant really understand why would you turn your back on a contract business is business
6558551 its more the conditioning factor of starting and stopping and getting in the huddle and doing all that we have plans to do some extra things with him even when were not practicing
6558552 taking a lot of hits you never know if you can jeopardize it
6558553 the only safe bet to not signing a new deal right away is staying out of harms way
6558554 some people dont agree and some people do agree and thats just what it boils down to during a holdout before i made the decision to hold out i took that into consideration
6558555 it is with deep sorrow that i announce the sad death of aub board of trustees member kamal shair who passed away on august 21 at the american university of beirut medical center
6558556 on behalf of aub i would like to extend my deep condolences to kamal shairs wife laura and his family
6558557 by using food as a reflection of lebanese heritage the food and feast festival 2008 aims to highlight the deepest values of those living in lebanon today exposing local identity groups to the different existing historical and cultural identities heritage sites and diverse food traditions with the primary aim of bringing to light what it means to be lebanese
6558558 the fifteen events which will take place in selected areas spanning the country from beirut to tyre in the south and ehden in the north will celebrate the traditions arts and crafts and food specialties unique to those areas
6558559 the activity will provide producers and residents of these areas with the opportunity to visit douma and surrounding areas in an effort to encourage inter community exchange promote inter regional dialogue a better understanding of lebanese inter regional traditions and hence a better understanding of the other
6558560 sadr was a kind man and he had many humanitarian qualities
6558561 this piece shows that we have to have unity you cant have a country by yourself
6558562 we dont know if he is alive or dead but we hope he will come back
6558563 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6558564 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6558565 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide
6558566 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6558567 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6558568 im ready to get back to work this is insane itll drive you nuts being stuck like this
6558569 the bottom line is that air gun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6558570 the study has greatly contributed to our knowledge of sperm whales but its also raised new questions we need to know more about such as their feeding and breeding patterns
6558571 theres still a lot we dont know about these huge creatures
6558572 the wage increase will have to come out from the labor ministry after which the cabinet will adopt it in its next session
6558573 hizbullah are claiming that the policy statement has given them this right but in fact everybody knows that this is not the case
6558574 the statement stressed the role and authority of the state in all issues including defense and foreign policy
6558575 the right of lebanons people army and resistance to liberate the israeli occupied shebaa farms kfar shuba hills and the lebanese section of ghajar village and to defend the country using all legal and possible means
6558576 historical achievement for the march 14 alliance and all advocates of independence in lebanon
6558577 i am surprised how some lebanese are linking the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to that of people who were reported to be missing in lebanon during the years of the civil war these are two separate issues
6558578 who says the government is giving legitimacy to hizbullah these are just ravings conjured up by the israelis to tarnish lebanons image
6558579 its based on exaggerations by mossad and the israeli intelligence services
6558580 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hizbullah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hizbullah
6558581 during the war in lebanon we had a massive capacity that we refrained from using because we were fighting a terrorist organization and not a state but if lebanon becomes a hizbullah state we will not be so restrained
6558582 ive been asking for a meeting with barak for six months but they keep putting me off
6558583 it may not solve anything but would probably lead to a better understanding of israels security needs
6558584 people felt that the efforts of non governmental organizations ngos and individuals to impact the ever deteriorating state of lebanons environment had reached its limits and that the creation of a political party would have a better chance in advancing the cause
6558585 we thought we should have a group that would push the government to change its environmental policies
6558586 unless we reach the decision making levels we cannot change policy environment is a common ground for people to introduce change to many things in lebanon
6558587 the levels of forest surface area it had in the 1970s at the very least
6558588 what we would like to call the green brigade under the command of the lebanese armed forces which would enforce laws that impact the environment and without which no progress can be expected on any front
6558589 5 000 years ago a squirrel could travel the whole country by merely hopping from tree to tree
6558590 if we carry on in this way our forests will have totally disappeared by 2030
6558591 out of 22 000 industrial factories half of which are in beirut 90 percent throw their toxic and non toxic waste in the sea
6558592 out of 863 samples of our drinking water 40 percent proved to be microbiologically polluted
6558593 800 companies selling water in lebanon only 11 percent are approved by the ministry of health the rest operate illegally
6558594 we have vowed not to run in any election so long as our political system is based on the archaic confessional distribution of responsibilities
6558595 in the next few years we need to focus on gaining more support
6558596 i cannot pretend that lebanese people will rally us because of our non confessional status but i know a lot of them have had enough with sectarianism

6558602 just after noon he was turned over to reuters the findings of the investigation allowed him to be released
6558603 he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
6558604 if there are legitimate issues about him or any other journalist lets have them aired openly and tested if there are none let them pursue their profession free from intimidation and fear
6558605 ali is part of our iraqi family his colleagues in london and baghdad are delighted hes been freed
6558606 we now look to the american military authorities to offer evidence and an explanation for alis detention
6558607 the defendant was arrested as he was placing a bomb inside the house that belonged to a displaced family in the neighborhood
6558608 the warrants accused him of murder and displacing people in al adel neighborhood
6558609 we strongly denounce this heinous act we are shocked by this barbaric action that was carried out by executive bodies against national figures
6558610 as i am always demanding the release of prisoners and talking against sectarianism
6558611 were not exactly the u s pattern but pretty close to it
6558612 based on data ive reviewed were patterning america only about a quarter late gdp in q2 slowed to 0 2 this year from 0 8 in q2 last year which is about the same deceleration rate as q2 in america
6558613 almost certainly gdp will be negative for q3 and i think the currency markets sense this and see a bank of england rate cut or two up ahead
6558614 ensure the quality of menstrual regulation and to share the knowledge of safe motherhood
6558615 we understand russias military reaction and view it as a response to provocation by georgia
6558616 we are ready to deliver weapons of a defensive character that do not violate the strategic balance of power in the region
6558617 russia has its own interests in the region and nobody wants to destabilize the region and i think according to this assessment it is of mutual interest to russia israel and pragmatic leaders of states in the region not to send this kind of long range missiles to syria
6558618 despite the absence of real support for such a forum from the israelis and the us russia above all hopes to hold it by the end of the year
6558619 i have decided no longer to intervene in state affairs
6558620 its true that i have intervened in all fields in foreign affairs and in domestic libyan matters like development housing urban planning and so on
6558621 i have no more big battles to fight and my position is becoming embarrassing
6558622 the situation has changed if i carry on there will be a problem
6558623 frustration with the libyan bureaucracy which has slowed down the pace of his reforms
6558624 he is young and was hoping rapidly to make major progress but he ran into bureaucratic obstacles that he had not expected
6558625 i think this is only a short term withdrawal that will pave the way for a new phase aimed at recasting his role in public life and giving it a legitimacy grounded in civil society
6558626 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6558627 we will not relax from our efforts to support reconstruction of afghanistan because we understand that with afghanistan the frontline against the taliban what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world
6558628 while it is true that there is a summer offensive by the taliban it is also true that the tactics the taliban had to adopt are more of a guerrilla nature than they are a head on confrontation with our forces and we have been successful in winning back territory
6558629 i accept that pakistan and the problems of terrorism there thats something thats got to be raised with the pakistan government
6558630 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year you are truly heroes of our country
6558631 you know that you are on the frontline of the fight against the taliban and you know that what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6558632 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6558633 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6558634 he has been saying to me reinstating the judges minus one the one being the chief justice weve said its not a question of any individual its a question of the institution
6558635 if they are not restored it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying that
6558636 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify our stay in the coalition
6558637 four civilians were killed when a heavy artillery shell landed in front of a mosque in bakara market seven others were wounded
6558638 the explosion occurred in a vacant car left at the blast scene we believe the blast was the result of plastic explosives set off by remote control
6558639 one of the injured soldiers a private is in a critical condition and is being operated on
6558640 there is some kind of expectation of doing something before the end of the year
6558641 i believe that the timeline is important but what is more important is the content and the nature of the understanding that we can reach with the palestinians
6558642 i think any attempt to bridge gaps which might be premature to bridge or any attempt to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement we want to reach can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence
6558643 the question of how long it should be on the shelf depends not on our willingness but on the situation on the ground
6558644 this is the reason we negotiate with pragmatic leaders although they dont control anything in gaza which is completely controlled by hamas even in the west bank they are not strong enough
6558645 nobody in the region can afford a terror state a failed state
6558646 when we are talking two states for two people the idea is that israel is the homeland for the jewish people and the palestinian state is the homeland for the palestinians
6558647 this is one of the two basic pillars the other of course is israels security
6558648 what the palestinians call the right to return is not an option
6558649 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they blew themselves up less than a minute apart
6558650 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6558651 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6558652 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6558653 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6558654 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside
6558655 as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6558656 bush assured him that us support will continue for pakistan its government and democratic forces
6558657 its an unwelcome development that distributors and consumers all having a hard time could have done without
6558658 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6558659 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6558660 redoubling efforts to bring it a deal to a final conclusion
6558661 it has taken us a very long time but we are very very close to close this agreement
6558662 still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6558663 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6558664 this visit is a bad omen for iraq it represents american dictatorship that rejects iraqs sovereignty
6558665 during the operation more than 30 militants were killed and a large cache of mortar rounds and ied improvised explosive device materials were destroyed by the commandos

6558679 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
6558680 i know what it means but why do i bug you
6558681 i said move along or im going to slug you

6558686 keep it up little one and get a taste of forearm
6558687 that doesnt even make sense i think you are deranged
6558688 i just wanted to stand here and wait for the bus
6558689 then you and i dont have anything further to discuss
6558690 my distaste for your prattle is both large and intense
6558691 you are as mad as a drunken sun soaked mule skinner
6558692 give your mom a kiss for me tell her ill be home late for dinner
6558693 i have no doubt about that in iptv god has clearly given us an incredibly powerful tool to help us in our work
6558694 it is absolutely amazing to me that an ordinary person can establish their own global iptv broadcasting capability in a matter of a couple of hours
6558695 in the 40 years that i have been involved with the media i have seen nothing like iptv particularly the way that the folk at safe worlds are doing it safe worlds iptv is by far the biggest technology breakthrough that i have seen
6558696 when i started in newspapers it would never enter a reporters mind that they could own their own newspaper now with safe worlds iptv i have my own channel that has far greater capacity than any newspaper that i ever worked on
6558697 a lot of companies can deliver video on demand and stream video to the internet but none can offer you your own global iptv channel that will allow you to sell products and collect payments and donations
6558698 safe worlds iptv delivers a viable commercial model that can be adapted to non profit usage
6558699 im not a technology expert but i am reliably told that a system like what safe worlds iptv offers for free would ordinarily cost a church or a ministry hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions if they tried to do it themselves
6558700 thats a lot of money that could be better spent in other parts of the ministry if churches used the free safe worlds iptv software
6558701 were way behind in our crime lab and whats happened with shows like csi juries think im a da in front of them and we should have all that well we dont
6558702 we dont have anybody who can do a handwriting comparison
6558703 we need additional resources additional people pathologists who can appear before grand juries and testify in court
6558704 in the past i have often been frustrated by having to take stored copies of documents with me to meetings and conferences with traction all i need is access to a computer connected to the internet i can then work as if i am at my office or home computer
6558705 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6558706 the reality is they have some investment properties and stuff
6558707 its not as if he lives in ten houses thats just not the case the reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use
6558708 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type
6558709 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6558710 the us is a christian nation the us is a christian nation
6558711 i think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty but leading them or driving them out of it
6558712 and after im finished im gonna need you to wipe me
6558713 because i cant use the wipes by myself i can use the toilet paper but not wipes
6558714 and i choked on them cause i eat them too fast and i was in salad
6558715 your fries i told you share your french fries and you gave me french fries and then me mommy and wilson went to salad
6558716 i need you to wipe me i said im finished
6558717 i dont want you to go i want you to stay here
6558718 hell get to the ton this week and good on him
6558719 hopefully people do run out because i watched essendons matthew lloyd in 2000 01 and st kildas fraser gehrig in 2004 and when i was younger tony lockett and those sort of blokes have the fans run out
6558720 my old mans pretty keen to get out there so i hopefully i can get there
6558721 you look in the paper the next day and he gets 10 shots a week anyway so hes bound to kick 2 8 or something like that
6558722 dons comments at the time raised questions and we sought clarification as to what he meant by unfair after the hearing
6558723 he said he regretted the choice of words and as much as he may disagree with the decision he did not intend any suggestion of bias or lack of procedure by the panel the judiciary chairman or the judiciary staff
6558724 he has apologised if that suggestion has been taken and his apology has been forwarded to the judiciary
6558725 their role is to be as consistent as they possibly can and i know they spend hours and hours each week reviewing incidents and comparing them to previous incidents to try and ensure that they are consistent
6558726 but the fact is each case has its own particular features and no two cases are ever completely alike and then it becomes a matter of judgement
6558727 but you always draw the line at any suggestion theyre being less than professional and honest in the way they carry out their duties
6558728 now fuel is 3 21 if fuel stays down we need less money however as you heard we are still running scared we are not going to quit
6558729 if the parking if the sponsorships if the fuel all three of which are thats 1 1 million you are talking about if those three things happen yes we are in good shape
6558730 when people move from riding their car to a bus or vise versa thats a major decision if they are happy with it and the bus is working it is still a savings whether fuel is 3 23 or 4 23

6558751 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6558752 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6558753 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6558754 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6558755 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6558756 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues

6558760 we are honored to provide financial support for moving this project forward
6558761 i want to leave a legacy at msu that will enable continued growth and excellence in the nursing program as an operating room nurse for more than 25 years i have witnessed firsthand the severity of the nursing shortage i want to ensure that quality nursing care is available for all us in our time of need
6558762 community involvement and philanthropy are very important to our lives
6558763 we are passionate about supporting projects that will help bring an end to the national nursing shortage
6558764 this gift will have a profound impact on generations of nursing students michigan state university and has transformed the dream of the nursing addition into a reality
6558765 notably this gift is the single largest philanthropic commitment in the colleges history
6558766 bernadette marquez endorsement of this project embodies her personal value of the education she received and the couples belief that a nursing education from michigan state university should be accessible to future generations of students at all levels
6558767 in response to the national nursing and nursing faculty shortage and in anticipation of support for a nursing addition the university created a doctor of philosophy in nursing program in the fall of 2000 and strategically increased total enrollments in the college of nursing more than 110 percent from 2003 to 2007
6558768 we now need to focus on expanding the physical capacity to accommodate our enrollment growth
6558769 i am honored to be a part of marking a new era of excellence in nursing education at michigan state university
6558770 i hope others will join my husband and me in this challenge to be a part of history
6558771 the requirements outlined in the proposed regulation will give pregnant and nursing women and their clinicians important and detailed information that will improve treatment decisions and health care outcomes
6558772 beyond labeling of current know risks we need more research to understand how medical treatments affect pregnant women and their children
6558773 these groups have not been adequately studied in the past so we cant conclude that research on medication use in the general population will apply to them this is an important point that holds true for all medical research
6558774 we know there are substantial differences between women and men and among different racial and ethnic groups in health and disease including responses to treatments research studies must be designed and analyzed with a focus on group differences if scientists dont ask questions about how women children minorities or the elderly might be affected differently and publish the results our understanding of population differences will never grow and well struggle to close gaps in health outcomes for these groups
6558775 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways hat can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
6558776 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
6558777 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
6558778 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
6558779 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability
6558780 to really improve adolescent health programs should seek to reduce risk taking improve social capital and improve levels of affluence
6558781 overall assessments of health may be an important measure for different reasons than more specific and detailed measurements it is a holistic approach as opposed to a specific approach
6558782 our analysis actually states that social capital affluence and risk taking all influence health but these things do not work together
6558783 our goal is to make discoveries that will ultimately allow us to intervene with the most effective early therapy before a mild traumatic brain injury results in a chronic problem
6558784 there is a high prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in soldiers and the consortiums work is driven by that we believe the conclusions of our research also will benefit civilians including athletes who have suffered concussions
6558785 the award of this grant confirms the collaborative platform of mission connect is a powerful and pivotal force in research
6558786 uniting these premier scientists in this shared research effort will accelerate the pace of discovery and provide the courageous men and women in our military with the best possible medical care for the brain injuries they have sustained
6558787 this grant is a huge boost to research in traumatic brain injury and will allow investigators to work together through mission connect
6558788 for baylor college of medicine it will help fund 10 investigators in neurology neuroscience neurosurgery and pain management and physical rehabilitation
6558789 only through collaboration can we make great strides in restoring function for our young brave men and women in the armed forces
6558790 we in the medical field must serve these men and women by moving the frontiers of treatment faster to provide state of the art interventions now
6558791 an effort led by drs doug dewitt and donald prough of the moody center for brain and spinal cord injury mission connect at utmb is a pivotal component of the department of defense project leading the field with a new blast injury model that simulates the exposure to improvised explosive devices additionally innovative therapies using stem cells anti inflammatory agents growth hormones and the expertise of aggressive rehabilitation at the transitional learning center round out the critical components of utmbs efforts
6558792 oxidative stress is a prominent feature of traumatic brain injury
6558793 we have developed a new antioxidant agent based on carbon nanotubes and in collaboration with dr thomas kent of the baylor college of medicine we will examine the therapeutic potential of the agent to treat mild tbi
6558794 our ability to apply novel intervention strategies to nervous system trauma based on the cellular and molecular biology observations made over the years would suggest that we will be able to make an impact on the treatment modalities to be developed over the next five years
6558795 at utmb the neuroscience research community has a long tradition of excellence dedicated to the understanding of trauma to the nervous system we are very happy to be able to make a contribution to this joint texas effort in what is an exemplary example of translational efforts at utmb
6558796 the institutions that make up mission connect have a long history of working together successfully this significant grant is testament to the fact that our collaboration makes us more competitive for funding than any one of our schools would have been alone and more importantly it strengthens our ability to improve the lives of those affected by traumatic brain injury
6558797 the award is very forward thinking since in addition to clinicians it includes neuroscientists working to elucidate the very basic and fundamental causes of nervous system injury all the way down at the molecular and cellular level
6558798 at present we know very little about how brain injury disrupts the connections and communication among neurons the neuroscientists participating will fill this huge gap in our knowledge armed with this information and working together in a collaborative environment clinicians and neuroscientists stand a much better chance of designing new and innovative treatments for traumatic brain injury
6558799 congratulations to dr valadka and the team for receiving this very prestigious and competitive funding which will improve our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved in traumatic brain injury the awarding of this grant validates our national stature in the neurosciences and will improve patient care and clinical outcomes for many patients
6558800 a model of innovative thinking and close collaboration between multiple institutions to understand and to advance the care of patients with mild traumatic brain injury
6558801 mild traumatic brain injury is a tremendous problem and there is an outstanding team in place ready to tackle it
6558802 decentralised management of the protected areas in the leopard habitat made it impossible to implement a unified program for leopard restoration over many years
6558803 moreover protection of red list species which includes the far eastern leopards did not fall under the remit of any of the other agencies
6558804 this announcement marks the culmination of five years of hard work by wwf
6558805 this is a real opportunity for the leopard population in the region to gain a foothold and pull themselves up from the brink of extinction
6558806 any construction in the region should take into consideration the fragile state of this leopard population
6558807 activities undertaken should in no way threaten the existence of the species

6558812 well be working out a schedule over the next few weeks to target the sessions that ill be involved in and im looking forward to not only offering kicking advice but some tactical assistance to the outside backs in particular
6558813 kicking whether it be for points territory or tactical reasons needs to be practised and i cant think of many better in the field than matt burke
6558814 matts one of the greatest players ever to pull on a waratahs jersey so hell command a huge amount of respect amongst the playing squad
6558815 hes also got a great aptitude for passing on his knowledge and i think hell make a fine kicking coach for nsw

6558823 its a good opportunity for him to come back and hopefully do well were still racing for october and its a good chance for him to improve and come back from what happened to his arm
6558824 for me when youve got some experience in the big leagues it doesnt make a difference
6558825 you can be in rookie ball or double a or triple a you have to pitch well and hit your spots and location you have to throw good pitches so it doesnt make a difference
6558826 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls
6558827 it works ok and those tests that say it doesnt are wrong
6558828 this along with the generally poor quality of the supporting evidence leads me to think that the claims made for the system are mostly hype and there is no reason to suppose that installing it will have any significant effect darn i could have used the extra cash to pimp my ride
6558829 it gives us some momentum sure but i think a one time win also shows up all the challenges we face as a league we cant match the world cup or the olympics but what we can do is manage expectations be conservative and get the message out that our new league will be a platform for the worlds best players
6558830 love and blood at the world cup with the footballers fans and freaks

6558854 congresswoman jones will always be remembered for her infectiously pleasant personality and her kind and welcoming demeanor the commitment and strong sense of loyalty that she had towards her constituents was endearing to us all

6558862 i wouldnt want that to become a mockery of itself
6558863 we may do it again if we feel like it but this time around we wanted people to focus on the music and not the spectacle
6558864 it felt good to be able to go back between then and now on tour and see the reception and acknowledgement of both records not just the first one it allowed us to sort of bear witness to our fans it felt like the bond with the fans solidified this time around
6558865 we have a pretty diversified portfolio but i do believe thats a first for us
6558866 more than just trying to do something new we were trying to do things we didnt get to completely do on the first record
6558867 we went in with a lot more self awareness and certainty this time we knew what we were doing
6558868 its not something thats very introspective its usually a reenactment of whatever experience im addressing its something i survived or something that rings true to me as a common experience its never so personal that it cant pertain to someone elses life if its about pain ultimately pain is pain to everyone
6558869 that was unconscionable to do we didnt even try i think people wouldve been disappointed if we had people might initially miss that theres not a big hit record on there like crazy but if there was any failed attempt at that magnitude of a song again it wouldve spoiled an otherwise solid album
6558870 i was so used to moderacy over my 15 year career so it was surprising

6558875 congress has failed us by borrowing recklessly and spending beyond its means the people weve sent to washington are bankrupting our country they are not being honest about the size of the loans theyre imposing on future generations this reckless borrowing and spending is endangering critical funding obligations like social security and veterans healthcare i want to change that immediately
6558876 congress has borrowed so much money that every baby born in america today inherits over 31 000
6558877 thats 125 000 of national debt owed by every family of four this borrow and spend approach is a cruel form of taxation without representation for our children and grandchildren even worse were now borrowing from foreign rulers in china saudi arabia and elsewhere hurting our independence and security

6558918 you dont need to be a student of the crushing of the prague spring in 1968 to find the sight of russian tanks rolling into a neighbouring country chilling
6558919 the georgian crisis is about more than vital issues of humanitarian need and rule of law over rule of force it raises a fundamental issue of whether and if so how russia can play a full and legitimate part in a rules based international political system exercising its rights but respecting those of others

6558970 humans are the only species than can actually think themselves stupider
6558971 if you really think that were doing something wrong at least have the balls to stand up and go hi my name is so and so
6558972 leaving the person out of the credits could be a mistake
6558973 if the three years is correct theres only a few people it can be but i dont know if the three years is correct because i know who was working on it three years ago and most of those people are still with the company maybe this person was fired from mythic and they dont want to say who they were publicly
6558974 i think the credits belong to the people who have been working on this game non stop whether theyve been with us for a week or whether theyve been with us for three years
6558975 in some of the cases that people left some of them hadnt done a great job for us
6558976 or some left just in a lurch do i feel badly for that no i dont feel badly at all im not going to shed a single tear for any of those guys
6558977 ill worry more about the people who are with me right now then those who decided that they didnt like the company or they wanted to take a better job somewhere else
6558978 i think the credits belong to the people who have been working on this game non stop whether theyve been with us for a week or whether theyve been with us for three years if youre part of the team when we launch you deserve to be in the credits no question about it that in my estimation is what the credits are for
6558979 if we set that precedent right now that anyone who worked on the game at any point in time is going to be in the credits the credits will be 20 pages long
6558980 online games are ever changing and have ever changing credits
6558981 show me one mmo that has been up for seven years that has kept the credits for every single person whos worked on the game as long as theyve had a large team we have hundreds of people working on warhammer and whats going to happen a year from now is maybe some of that team goes on to another game and we bring in other people to replace them and then what happens the year after that or the year after that if we set that precedent right now that anyone who worked on the game at any point in time is going to be in the credits the credits will be 20 pages long within a couple of years and nobody does that
6558982 if all the game companies agree on a standard for credits on that day ill be thrilled
6558983 one i cant fit it in the manual and second i think that does a bit of a disservice as well to the people who are still part of the team who are still working on the game you know what if people want to complain about credits then how come were not tracking the months how come we dont have the five star credit section for people who worked on it for three years then the four star credit section and then the two star credit there are so many issues with it and we want to keep it really simple if youre on the team when we launch youre in the full credits section with some exceptions into the special thanks for certain people who have left under difficult circumstances
6558984 there is no requirement to have credits a lot of companies dont give any credits but we do if all the game companies agree on something even internally theres no absolute plan within ea because its up to the studios on that day ill be thrilled until then everyone who is currently at mythic whos worked on warhammer is going to be in the credits and thats good enough for me
6558985 the clinton family released a statement saying tubbs jones was a
6558986 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6558987 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6558988 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6558989 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6558990 what people are going through every single day here in america
6558991 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6558992 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6558993 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
6558994 maybe youre struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home
6558995 then again that same day when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember well its seven seven houses
6558996 and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6558997 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office
6558998 the bottom line was that we didnt want this to drag on
6558999 i have felt indebted to a c t audiences and to careys beautiful productions of my work for many years
6559000 asking the question what would have happened if after the war instead of staying in england and being raised there as an english schoolboy he had gone back to prague but of course the play is also much more than that stoppard asks what is our relationship as individual people to these enormous shifts in history where do artists change the direction of history
6559001 what is particularly wonderful about doing rock n roll at a c t is that it fits our core acting company so beautifully which has pleas enormously since he has enjoyed collaborating with them so much over the years
6559002 the democrats really needed hillary to win and not as vp
6559003 we could have had hillary rocketing through the democratic convention
6559004 when voters are asked which candidate could better manage the economy
6559005 turning a four point deficit in july s reuters zobgy poll into a 49 percent to 40 percent lead
6559006 delivering a more populist message that further highlights his economic differences with senator john mccain
6559007 the biggest reason why this race remains close in this dem leaning political environment is because of obamas inability to close the deal with some of clintons supporters
6559008 more massively than any campaign in the history of american politics on the ground game
6559009 everyone in the political class is now talking about the possibility of obama shocking the world and picking hillary clinton as his running mate
6559010 in many ways my life has been an open book but i havent always been the one writing the story with this show however people will get to see and hear with their own eyes and ears what really goes on in my life and i think theyll come to understand me a little bit better with each episode
6559011 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6559012 i fear that the international community if by that we mean the organisation for security and cooperation in europe osce the european union the united states and even canada is biased against russia it is an open secret that the wests powerful propaganda machine is currently working at full blast in a bid to create a sort of moral cordon sanitaire around russia furthermore one should admit that the west has partly succeeded in this which however is pointless in the long run russia is no longer as weak as it once was it shall withstand such pressure from the west
6559013 the problem is that many folks try to grasp some sense of who i am by taking the best version of themselves projecting that to the nth degree factoring in all the goodness they can perceive which often isnt much then they call that god

6559027 he is one of the top players in the league

6559030 some people will agree some people wont agree jackson told reporters thursday after his first practice
6559031 i expect mixed reviews when you talk about this kind of money a lot of people dont understand why you turn your back on it
6559032 before i made the decision to hold out i took that into consideration
6559033 i do apologize for my statement being a little critical of them
6559034 i still feel the same way about the organization as i did after the last game of the season
6559035 i have faith that i would retire as a ram
6559036 due to the nfl the way the business works sometimes something like that has to take place
6559037 sometimes the team does it sometimes the player does it
6559038 a lot of the guys here like torry holt helped me become a man
6559039 im looking to put in the extra time to make up for it
6559040 i just want to make sure i get the repetitions in to get the muscle memory of plays im not thinking im reacting on the go i would expect that next week will be a heavy load for me in practice
6559041 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy
6559042 he brings great experience to the club will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player the fans are sure to support
6559043 i have known eddie for a number of years i rate him as a first class player and person and im honoured to welcome him to the galaxy family
6559044 unfortunately the sport of soccer is also a business and in order to bring eddie to the galaxy we were required to make salary budget space available and our only available option was to move carlos
6559045 carlos is proven to be one of the great goalscorers in the history of this league and i have the highest regard for him we wish him the very best in the future

6559055 cost benefit ratio for usability is 1 10 100 once a system is in development correcting a problem costs 10 times as much as fixing the same problem in design if the system has been released it costs 100 times as much relative to fixing in design
6559056 how am i supposed to reason with people like this
6559057 the psychological scars resulting from this situation would be very difficult to heal there is a lot of vengeance and vindictiveness and israel is of course the ultimate beneficiary
6559058 it is becoming increasingly clear that the persistence of crisis is an integral part of the regional order especially the overall israeli palestinian scene israel will do all it can to maintain or at least prolong the conflict between the two palestinian camps
6559059 i still favour the two state solution and will continue to do so but to the extent that you discover its not practical anymore or that its not going to happen you start to think about what the alternatives are i think that the feeling is that there are two courses taking place that are opposed to one another on the one hand there is what people are saying and thinking on both sides there is the sense that we are running out of time that if we want a two state solution we need to implement it quickly but on the other hand if we are looking at what is happening on the ground in israel and the occupied territories you see things happening in the opposite direction as if they are not connected to reality thought is running in one direction reality in the other

6559113 die verteidigung war bei der em nicht so stark und pr sent wie bei der wm wir brauchen alternativen deshalb war es sinnvoll tasci und westermann spielen zu lassen
6559114 ill never forget the incident in 2002 but im also thankful that i was able to walk away from it and race here again bristol is one of my favorite tracks on the circuit so thats why i continue to come back im really excited about this weekend so while some will be recapping the incident six years ago im thinking ahead to friday night
6559115 its a real treat for us to have cajun industries onboard this weekend at bristol
6559116 this is a big race for mike harmon racing and were excited to have a caliber sponsor like cajun industries aboard and were hoping for a good run under the lights friday night
6559117 its great to have all this support going into a race like bristol
6559118 sponsorship is really tough with the economy in a rumble but im extremely appreciative and thankful for their support of our race team i hope to make it up to them with a solid run this weekend
6559119 its been a while since ive had a good finish at bristol i would like to change that stat on friday night
6559120 we have to get in the show there is a bunch of cars expected to be at bristol this weekend so we have to qualify our way in im confident we can do that once thats complete we can focus on the race patience and staying out of the wrecks are critical if we can finish in the top 20 well be happy
6559121 we had no such talks as far as i know
6559122 an apparent attempt by the fed to prevent a repeat of the cascading rumors that helped sink
6559123 could lead to further attempts across the 27 member eu aimed at blocking foreign investment incursions into sensitive industries
6559124 stress breaking down barriers that prevent people and ideas from connecting
6559125 she was very shaped by her experiences in the military
6559126 she has very strong opinions and shes a very religious person shes very warm and hospitable
6559127 hopefully i can provide some assistance in the future to this school and all that it can be
6559128 i know you are working very hard and struggling to bring up this school but i have said i will assist the school and i will do so
6559129 senator obama has not honored the promises he gave me when we met in 2006 and in his earlier letter to the school
6559130 he has not given us even one shilling but we still have hope
6559131 we interpreted his words as meaning he would help fund the school either personally or by raising sponsors or both in order to give our school desperately needed modern facilities and a face lift
6559132 meanwhile denials will run deep with all kinds of its different here logic rest assured its not different in canada
6559133 what matters is affordability people cannot really afford the prices here and it is a mistake to think that 40 year amortizations in canada will make things affordable up north
6559134 lower rates havent helped in the united states where the federal reserve has cut its key rate to 2 25 per cent from 5 25 per cent in 2007
6559135 obamas patriotism is not being attacked in an ad mccains just out there saying hes putting his own personal political ambition ahead of the countrys its you know its just its just we cant hit the girl i dont care how far feminisms saying you cant hit the girl and you cant
6559136 i t is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat sic party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6559137 i think this is a classic illustration here where affirmative action has reared its ugly head against them its the reverse of it theyve theyve ended up nominating and placing at the top of their ticket somebody whos not qualified who has not earned it
6559138 before you eat stop every time and think what does your body really want many times i assume i am in the mood for chocolate when i am stressed and nine times out of ten i think and realize what i really want is a turkey burger
6559139 it became evident starting in denver july 11 13 that the mail from home program was really gaining a lot of momentum
6559140 and in brainerd aug 8 10 a new record of 1800 cards collected in one day was set with an overall record of over 5000 cards for the weekend
6559141 i made the decision then that we would have a car at the u s nationals dedicated to the troops who receive the mail and on the car is a picture of a soldier reading his mail in the war zone
6559142 our goal is to keep the momentum going and exceed the 90 000 number of cards we delivered to the troops in 2007 we project that mts will deliver over 100 000 cards by the end of 2008
6559143 is the result of the dedication of the 1100 plus employees of mail terminal services in supporting our partners at dhl global mail the united states postal service and all of their customers at home and overseas
6559144 weve enjoyed tremendous racing success through our technical partnership with all of the don schumacher racing teams including wins by the valvoline mts funny car
6559145 were proud to further support the mts at the track correspondence campaign and our troops abroad with a special paint scheme on jack beckmans funny car during the u s nationals
6559146 we at don schumacher racing are privileged to be a part of this wonderful program that mail terminal services has introduced to our team and nhra
6559147 we heartily support mts s efforts in this extremely rewarding endeavor
6559148 were ready for the milwaukee mile this weekend were taking all three cars
6559149 milwaukee is a place my parents took me and my brother to for years when were younger
6559150 i can remember the usac indy cars and stock cars running on the same weekend during the fair that was cool my hero back then was the 75 of butch hartman
6559151 both of my drivers had good runs at dixie josh had a good car and he came from the back after starting 25th
6559152 jordan sims is ready to go racing as hes been idle since salem challenge race in july where his luck was not so good
6559153 were ready to turn the tables this weekend at milwaukee with him hes a better driver then what his results have shown i would like thank the whole lorz motorsports team for there efforts this year
6559154 this is definitely my new favorite short track for sure crew chief doug wolcott and the bdr guys are awesome and i cant wait to get back in this thing at vegas
6559155 the racing was a lot more difficult than driving in qualifying
6559156 i saved a lot in the race knowing that we had to be good in the end at the end i think we had the best truck out there but we just didnt have a chance with all the cautions
6559157 we had a good car in practice and then we had a tough time in qualifying
6559158 at the end of the race we were just riding and i got a real bad chatter in the tires with about 70 to go i was trying to make it the rest of the way we were looking for a caution so we could come back in and change the tires but we didnt know we were going to be the caution
6559159 the left front went flat going down into three and when i got down in the corner it really took off into the wall when it hit the wall it broke the rotors and messed it up pretty good
6559160 it was real fun to come hear and race bristol but it was not the way we wanted it to turn out
6559161 we locked up the rookie of the year on the first lap when drew herring had his crash
6559162 thats not the way we wanted to win the award but we are happy acquiring the rookie of the year honors i have to thank all my guys who have worked hard on this car every week i knew once we started shaking the bad luck we would be alright winning at hickory has been the highlight of the season but the rookie award means a lot too
6559163 i hope we can get the car fixed and go to mansfield
6559164 we dont have a high incidence of crime in our forest preserves
6559165 we dont want vigilante type people and we dont want anybody getting hurt we want eyes and ears
6559166 weve got a lot of support for this race with sponsors and everyone else thats coming to see us race hopefully we can put on a good show and bring home a couple of wins
6559167 were very happy to have the metro milwaukee napa auto parts dealers and whos your daddy energy drink returning for this weekend
6559168 plus weve got great support from the wisconsin boilermakers union local 107 the chicago regional council of carpenters and osborn and sons trucking
6559169 im really looking forward to going back to the milwaukee mile one of my favorite tracks ever
6559170 weve really ran well there in the past with the super late model and i think we will have a car to run up front this time too i just cant wait to get there ive been waiting for this show all year
6559171 weve been working on the car all week getting it switched over for milwaukee so we should be ready to go
6559172 my teammate scott rueschenberg will be racing as well and the more information we can get for this race the better
6559173 bristol where do you start it seems like one part luck and the other part survival we have not tested here and i have no prior racing experience at bristol but i feel confident in the set up that my team has provided me with and i just plan to be patient race smart and capitalize on my short track racing experience
6559174 i have been to a few arca re max series tests and races with john wes to learn his driving style and have learned quickly that he has talent my strategy for him this weekend is pretty simple qualify for the race and stay out of trouble if he can do that i feel pretty confident in bringing home a top 15 finish
6559175 we were all very excited about hosting the old school racing series and were disappointed when the announcement came that the series would not be competing at south boston speedway this season
6559176 hopefully our fans will understand that this decision was not made by us
6559177 i regret that the 2008 season has been cancelled and apologize to the old school fans that have been dying to see their past heroes compete once again
6559178 we had a great schedule planned for 2008 but to make this series survive the test of time with the help of our new partners we have designed a much better series for the ultimate fan experience i dont want to go too far into details because we want to do that when we announce the redesigned old school racing program
6559179 we were practicing and it was pretty warm but got warmer as the day went on our car seemed to get better with the heat fred lorenzen was in holmans holman moody car and they were running a certain lap time and later on as it got hotter we ran what they ran so we thought we were going to be okay well when qualifying came around marvin went out and beat lorenzen and sat on the pole lorenzen was mad and thought there was something wrong with the clock that our time couldnt have been legitimately faster than theirs they had the pace car go around the next morning and check the clock he just knew it was wrong
6559180 it was a lot of fun being on the pole at the start of the race lorenzen figured that he would take the lead on the first lap which he didnt something told marvin to just open that baby up
6559181 i believe there were about 50 60 laps to go and we found ourselves leading the race because there were a few cautions and other cars dropped off to pit when we moved into the lead we stayed there
6559182 elliott sadler was leading and john andretti was behind us in the 43 there was no real threat to pass there were about two car lengths in between them when he won it was a pretty exciting win because it was like the old days with pearson in the 21 and petty in the 43 finishing first and second
6559183 bill is a veteran driver if the car is right he will qualify well weve run well at bristol a number of times it seemed like when we didnt run good at other places we always ran good there maybe it will work that way this weekend
6559184 our initiation to the world of super late model racing has begun steve einhaus and tim olson have put together a fantastic series with a great group of talented drivers
6559185 this is a big move up from where we have been racing the past two 1 2 years fortunately our crew chiefs kevin tunks and mike butz are both veterans of this super late model game and im confident they will get us up to speed quickly this weekend at milwaukee
6559186 nick had a pretty good run there for his first
6559187 we knew the transition to the asa midwest tour super late models would be tough especially at a track like wir
6559188 we had a great set up but the engine just went flat about mid straight and we would lose everything that we had gained in the corners bruce and the guys at b amp b engines have really been working hard all week on the motor issues and the dyno says theyve got it solved just in time for milwaukee where horsepower is king
6559189 it was an honor to get to race in the dixieland 150 i could sense the tradition this race had the stands were full and there was a lot of excitement in the air just making the field was a big accomplishment for my dixie chopper team
6559190 going to milwaukee is really a neat deal this track has so much history to it and will be a lot of fun to race there
6559191 this is going to be something very new to me and i feel that i am
6559192 our crew has really been working hard this week to get the car back together and to get it ready to be fast at milwaukee we are going into this weekend with the goal of stepping up our qualifying program in return we believe that we will be able to have better finishes
6559193 going to the green the leaders got together and the next thing i knew i was flying in the air
6559194 i have to thank the guys from wes griffiths crew and everyone else that helped us to get back out before the race restarted
6559195 we where able to stay on the lead lap with a car held together with vice grips and duct tape
6559196 i really felt bad for all our guys after that wreck because we where never able to show how strong our car really was
6559197 to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they not this court say what the law is
6559198 revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law
6559199 in pursuit of justice prosecuting terrorism cases in the federal courts
6559200 from epic mega trials such as those involving the first attack on the world trade center 1993 and the east african embassy bombings 1998 to individual pre emptive prosecutions focused on prevention
6559201 lies in the extensive record of actual prosecutions going back to the early 1990s and continuing to this day in federal courts around the country
6559202 prosecutors have invoked a host of specially tailored antiterrorism laws as well as long standing generally applicable federal criminal statutes to obtain convictions in terrorism cases
6559203 have consistently exercised jurisdiction over defendants brought before them even those defendants apprehended by unconventional or forcible means
6559204 the disarray that plagues the military commissions at guantanamo with abundant litigation as well as dissension within the military command structure does not bode well for proposals to create a brand new system from scratch
6559205 a new report says election officials often are outsourcing their responsibilities to the very companies that make the e voting machines even trusting those companies to count the votes
6559206 elections should be accountable to the people and run by public officials who are selected by the people when thats handed over to private vendors these public elections are no longer public
6559207 the depth of the current dependence is shocking but even more shocking is the fact that our elections are dependent on vendors whose records reveal their unethical and even unlawful behavior as well as their incompetence
6559208 there was really nothing on the market we would buy then
6559209 and theres still nothing we would want to buy today
6559210 theyre telling these silly son of a guns to go stick it and theyre honoring a commitment to the public
6559211 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
6559212 would you want to know if the most horrific attack on your country was perpatrated by its own government would you really want to know
6559213 made by the wachowski brothers and joel silver of matrix fame
6559214 we can be sure that the wachowski brothers were referencing the order out of chaos system since at one point in the film the opressive english parliment gets frustrated that their society is embracing the terrorist acts against them and decides to begin committing terrorist acts under the guise of v in order to turn the people against him and again embrace their oppressive form of government police state they even unleash a biological virus on their people in the film killing almost 100 000 people and if the history of terrorism in literature and cinema is any indicator you should probably mind your hygeine habits in the coming years because as exhibited below several times in recent years terrorist acts have been depicted almost exactly as they go down in entertainment sold to us beforehand
6559215 as for anyone who scoffs at the notion that government connected interests could be planting depictions of terrorism in hollywood that isnt the allegation the more realistic notion is that such interests have been made privy to certain plotlines and then decide to preempt them in real life to affect how you see their portrayal upon release of the entertainment material
6559216 but perhaps that is the desired goal by the powers that be to push americans until they fight back and really give you a pretext to lay on the police state thick since the outcome of another staged attack like 9 11 really cannot be gauged considering the growth in the population who are not so sure 9 11 is what they thought it was anymore if an attack were to occur tomorrow i dont believe theyre certain they can sell us on their version of it and i believe that scares them
6559217 i am the world trade center out of the loop
6559218 the true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception the one who lies with sincerity
6559219 guantanamo sends a signal to some of our friends provides an excuse for example to say the united states is not upholding the values that theyre trying to encourage other countries to adhere to and my answer to them is is that we are a nation of laws and rule of law
6559220 for america to again have a credible voice in the world today we need a new foreign policy

6559224 all the trends we have seen recently is that these kinds of facilities are going into decline we are closing post offices public toilets and public houses we cannot afford to let it continue when we see this kind of demographic change taking place
6559225 there will have to be a massive investment in research into dementia if we dont crack that we are going to find ourselves with a huge number of people suffering from dementia and the costs will be enormous
6559226 there is a huge churn of one million people either coming in or going out of the country with the intention of staying for a year
6559227 the basic message in terms of population growth is that yesterdays migrants as well as todays migrants are contributing to the population growth that we are seeing

6559231 it is a good relationship we get on with the job
6559232 we are utterly resolved in our determination to support this new democracy in afghanistan
6559233 we will not relax from our efforts to support the renewal of afghanistan because we understand that with afghanistan the front line against the taliban affects the rest of the world
6559234 we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success
6559235 this week also i believe our olympic athletes like everyone else in the country will remember you have shown exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication
6559236 you make the country proud every day of the week and every week of the year
6559237 cabinet ministers plotting is nothing new we have them here too

6559244 the competition was very crazy because we were changing the leader all the time
6559245 i cant yet believe that i won this competition it was so fast it was a dream for me i will be persistent in my efforts and achieve better results in the future i believe i can do that
6559246 i would have liked to go to the london 2012 olympic games as defending olympic champion and i cant believe im standing here disappointed with silver but i am
6559247 im a winner and i had been undefeated coming into this this is the one i didnt want to lose i had to work to get back into the lead two or three times it was a tough competition
6559248 cinema is less expensive than other leisure pursuits despite financial pressures people still need to get out of the house and forget about their worries we expect comedies and adventure films to do particularly well this year as we look for escapism
6559249 history has shown that in times of economic hardship consumers find even more value in home entertainment as video is one of the most cost effective forms of entertainment we would expect to see continued volume growth in our market as consumers tighten their belts
6559250 we need to have all of our arrows pointing in the same direction
6559251 if it doesnt work i still have time to try something else
6559252 its not going to work this time because ive been here before
6559253 a strongly held belief in the things you hope for and the evidence that things you cannot see will manifest in your life
6559254 im not sure why she would do something like that she was such a sweet person
6559255 well i guess i had a good childhood because my mom never did that to me
6559256 well at least you had a mom and dad all i had was my mom
6559257 why dont i have a closer relationship with my parents or anyone else for that fact
6559258 i have seen a lone woman drive into a dealership park walk around for a while and finally go up to the receptionist and ask for some assistance i find this curious as women directly influence nearly 75 or more of all car sales to watch trained attack jackals er sales associates virtually ignore her because they believe that she is not the decision maker is almost surreal
6559259 in most deals involving married couples the woman is in charge of the final decision perhaps men instinctively know that we can often become mesmerized by shiny fast moving objects and make poor decisions without the steadying influence of our better halves many of us would be living outdoors under a lean to foraging for sustenance of course we would have some really cool cars women are particularly sensitive to time wastin and bull shootin and being disrespected on top of it all makes enduring a difficult and expensive process that much more grating and demeaning
6559260 is to simply announce loudly that the car is for you you are the only decision maker and you want to buy a car today

6559262 there was a deluge of rain and that incorporated with the high tide produced severe flooding
6559263 there was about two to three feet of water affecting many residential and commercial properties
6559264 weve got dry suits weve got wading polls weve got lines weve got rescue sleds all that equipment was put to good use
6559265 the water started to flood over the toilets like a river and within about 15 minutes it was up to about six or seven inches all through my basement
6559266 its gone right underneath the counter right to the back wall to the stock room
6559267 you cant be a one dimensional player a lot of one dimensional players will leave a lot faster than the guy who can do a lot of different things
6559268 i can run i can catch and i can block i think thats the reason why the broncos brought me over here
6559269 im not a natural fullback but at the same time im stronger than most fullbacks
6559270 physically i go in there and i can slam into a linebacker but im really a runner thats what i do coming out of the backfield and catch some balls
6559271 but ill do whatever my coaches ask me to do i wont complain about it ill just go out there and just do my job pound for pound im probably one of the strongest guys on the team
6559272 fullbacks are usually slower they take longer to read pittman flies right in there he hits whoever
6559273 thats my type i like somebody thats just going to go all out
6559274 its just an adjustment for me its just another step in my career this is my 11th year and im excited to do a lot of new things so like i said if the coach asks me to do it i just go out there and i have fun doing it
6559275 i really dont like lead blocking too much but i go in there and ill do it just catching passes its a mismatch me against a linebacker 1 on 1 i can really take advantage of a linebacker
6559276 and physically thats a mismatch too because physically they cant cover me so theres a lot of things i can bring to the table in the passing game so i will say just really coming out of the backfield
6559277 it was hard there are times that you come to practice and you know you aint gonna play or in the game you know youre not gonna play theres a lot of emotions but i just dealt with it i handled it well and im still here
6559278 im competing with him but theyre going to give it to the guy who has been here five or six years
6559279 if they think im worthy enough to be in the rotation then ill be in the rotation if not then ive got to wait till next year
6559280 he attacks it like a pro now and his understanding has improved tremendously
6559281 the game has slowed down for him you can be as big and strong and fast as you want but if youre out there thinking or youre not sure then you cant use that to your advantage now hes sure of what hes doing so his physical attributes are showing up

6559285 everyone weve spoken to about this man even at the prison he escaped from fears david green
6559286 he can be one of the most intimidating and dangerous men youll ever meet but like a chameleon he can blend into your neighborhood and may be living just down the street
6559287 david green is a threat to the safety of any community where he hides
6559288 but until he strikes he uses his expertise at changing his appearance and identity to avoid capture
6559289 the concept behind these task forces is to bring local agencies together under a combined effort to make our communities safer in this case thats exactly what happened and the u s marshals service is proud to play a part in the effort
6559290 he carries a gun he is a suspect in numerous violent crimes several involving gangland style executions and he has a history of armed offenses

6559309 it seems the right time to remind georgian government and its people what russia has done for this country it was time when georgia asked russia to take it in to escape turkish enslavement and only thanks to support and protection of our empire and blood shed by russian soldiers they were able to preserve their state system and remain a nation
6559310 unfortunately for the time present georgia is intoxicated by saakashvilis propagandistic speeches
6559311 the nation which had joint the russian empire long ago was subjected to genocide and this fact forced our country russians orthodox to extend help to ossetia
6559312 today we suffer losses human material and even moral ones our help is only sacrificial service to our brother i lament that the other historically and spiritually close nation has left brotherly feelings
6559313 the priority task for fraternal peoples of ossetia georgia and russia is to come over this nightmare to cast aside alien harmful influence and reconcile with each other

6559327 crude futures were higher extending gains from yesterday on weakness in the dollar and persistent geopolitical fears

6559330 before the tragic flight the captain turned back to the gate reporting a problem with the heating system in an air intake
6559331 the heating problem was treated and corrected by spanair maintenance personnel the fault was isolated and the aircraft dispatched for flight within the set standards of maintenance manuals
6559332 a conundrum that may take a significant length of time to unravel
6559333 the single reasonably hard fact to emerge from this catastrophe is that the left hand engine appears to have caught fire as the aircraft made its take off roll
6559334 aircraft engine fires are mercifully rare and their cause is inevitably the subject of much speculation
6559335 both internal and external forces that could have prompted the fire and events that occurred immediately following ignition that could have exacerbated the substantial loss of life
6559336 the crisis at spanair led to a tragedy with 153 dead
6559337 the technical inspection by spanair could have committed a fatal error
6559338 the spanair pilots had denounced the long days they had to put in stretching their limits to the full the punishing hours and the fact that the cabin crew were acutely shortstaffed during intense traffic in august
6559339 everything we did with the aircraft was by the rules or regulations
6559340 we will have to wait for the investigation to understand exactly what happened the complete events and the reason for the accident we will have to be patient
6559341 we have been doing a lot of original reporting and we are going to be doing a lot more

6559359 the endorsements which appear on this book are solely reflective of the authors writing and not an endorsement of the content of the work the content is solely the authors responsibility i apologize for any misunderstanding this might have created a corrected back cover is in the process of being designed
6559360 i am the author of under orders a spiritual handbook for military personnel
6559361 under orders is a handbook to assist service members not a field manual and it is not doctrine for chaplains in the u s military in my book i expressed my personal opinions and it made it clear that they were my opinions my writing never disparages any religion or spiritual preference but seeks to encourage service members to find faith of any sort i have served soldiers of all faiths and religious dispositions for nearly 20 years and believe that military chaplains support soldiers through the principle of the free exercise of religion this book is a personal work and neither general petraeus nor major general hertlings comments should be misunderstood as an endorsement of my work but rather as an enthusiasm for helping soldiers with their lives
6559362 making matters inestimably worse now and only after first being publically caught red handed by mrff petraeus literally strains credulity by claiming that he never knew that his private written endorsement of this evangelizing book was being seen in the public domain note well that theres no denying he said it oops just that he had no idea the public would ever find out he actually expects us to just blindly accept that such absurd blissful ignorance is possible when that book was written by a well known subordinate army officer chaplain and heavily and regularly advertised for many many months in the air force army navy and marine corps times next petraeus will be telling us that he just found massive wmds all over iraq lets let the judge decide mrff is now officially putting both army chaplain lt col william mccoy maj gen hertling and gen petraeus on direct notice not to destroy any of the written or electronic records of their communications about this endorsement as we fully intend to comprehensively introduce this entire sordid affair into our ongoing federal litigation against the dod in kansas city kansas where mrff is irrefutably establishing the dods pervasive and pernicious pattern and practice of massive constitutional religious liberties violations actions have consequences completely irrespective of whether petraeus or hertling made dubious private or intentionally public written comments petraeuss immediate dismissal and trial by general courts martial under article 134 is not merely warranted but demanded lt col mccoy and maj gen hertling deserve absolutely the same swift punishment
6559363 comments were intended for him personally rather than for the general public
6559364 to designate the time and place of religious service and in the field to indicate the chaplains quarters or office
6559365 ultimately i hope we will bring the good news to our world not my good news but the good news of the gospel

6559397 is surely the first to put the journey down in print for a modern audience to share
6559398 while headline inflation picked up on the month this morning s report shows little evidence of these higher prices filtering through to core inflation
6559399 looking ahead it appears as though the worst may be behind us
6559400 while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace
6559401 look for the headline readings to hang around three per cent for some time yet while core looks poised to grind higher as the loonie at par discounts begin to fade out of the calculation later this year
6559402 whether inflation is or isn t a problem in canada depends on which number you look to for an answer
6559403 if you don t drive don t have a mortgage payment and don t eat fresh produce you re in luck conveniently the bank of canada strips out many of the fastest rising categories from its core cpi measure but the typical canadian has all of those costs
6559404 for those of us who don t believe that oil grain and import prices are down for the count inflation is still a looming threat
6559405 it s hard to get too excited about the prospect that the bank of canada will ease the policy rate any time soon
6559406 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6559407 the russians have shown evidence that they re willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area
6559408 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6559409 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6559410 the slide in the dollar has taken some of the wind out of the bear s sail in the energy complex
6559411 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels

6559418 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
6559419 mr phelps is a superior athlete by any measure but his judgment regarding the mcdonalds and kelloggs frosted flakes endorsements was either 1 ill advised by his handlers 2 the irrational product of too much blood sugar or 3 a sad triumph of greed over good ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
6559420 octagon sports agent peter carlisle is making a strategic branding mistake by aligning michael phelps to kelloggs frosted flakes and mcdonalds in this era of escalating child obesity and diabetes the last association michael phelps wants is that of junk food pusher
6559421 while michael phelps may consume thousands of calories a day and burn them off through olympic training americas kids arent so fat sickly and have little hope of accomplishing a single sit up much less olympic gold kids are watching and michael phelps going for the quick cash of pushing junk food at the expense of children tarnishes his image similar to an association with cigarettes or alcohol would national action against obesity and the childrens international obesity foundation implore michael phelps and all celebrities and athletes to reject offers to push more sugar fat and hazardous calories onto americas kids
6559422 as we set out to look at the causes of obesity in our film
6559423 this is unconscionable and we hope that michael phelps reconsiders his endorsement contracts
6559424 because children under five deserve environments full of healthy options not marketing venues for junk food producers

6559433 there are about a dozen lizard species known to be short lived in which a good proportion of individuals die off by a year
6559434 but there are always some that make it to the next year so the species maximal longevity is greater than one year
6559435 one of the most robust things to come out of life history theory is that trade offs exist
6559436 if you increase the number of young the cost is often accelerated aging if you get something that lives longer you get costs early in life with lower fertility and even sterility
6559437 that they practically grow in front of your very eyes

6559450 trying to pass one fish off as another is often called species substitution but i have another name for it fraud

6559478 i do an hour of cardio on the elliptical and then light weight lifting just upper body
6559479 i dont do lower body because you want your lower body to loosen up to make room for the baby to come through
6559480 i always thought i was going to gain a lot of weight because im a big girl naturally i walk around at 175 lbs im 511
6559481 i thought oh god im going to be like 250 lbs and huge i know a lot of women have that fear but because im already a big girl i was just imagining myself to be a giant
6559482 i think all women kind of like to be in control but i want to really experience the birth
6559483 society tells you you get pregnant you go to the hospital and that was just naturally what i was going to do but once i saw that there was another option it just fit me
6559484 i want to be fully present i dont want any medications i just want to be in control of the situation as much as i can be anyway
6559485 its not for everybody so you have to do your research and at least be informed even if you dont decide to do a home birth or work with a midwife you can at least be aware of the fact that you have a voice at the hospital and pick a good doctor
6559486 now if i was the first woman in the world having a baby id be scared to death
6559487 i have never experienced it for myself but i see all of these other women that i know are nowhere near as strong as i am physically emotionally mentally so if they can do it so can i
6559488 my thing is learning the ways to reduce that pain and be in control of yourself so youre not making it worse and working against yourself i feel like i have an advantage just with my mind set and with my experiences as an athlete and knowing my body

6559492 because thats how you end up with a big baby so thats a struggle for me ive been told that in my third trimester its really important so im there and im really trying
6559493 hopefully i wont be too strict because thats something i could see myself doing being too protective and strict
6559494 i hope to be patient and fair and just a good example to my kids and consistent i think its important to teach kids values and morals how to love themselves and how to be a leader not a follower

6559512 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways that can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
6559513 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
6559514 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
6559515 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
6559516 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability

6559519 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6559520 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6559521 the investigation was an extensive state of the art reconstruction of the events that affected wtc 7 and eventually led to its collapse
6559522 numerous facts and data were obtained then combined with validated computer modeling that is believed to be close to what actually occurred a single computer simulation of the structural response to fires took about eight months to complete on powerful computing workstations and clusters
6559523 nonetheless the nist investigation of wtc 7 is based on a huge amount of data
6559524 these data come from extensive research interviews and studies of the building including audio and video recordings of the collapse rigorous state of the art computer methods were designed to study and model the buildings collapse these validated computer models produced a collapse sequence that was confirmed by observations of what actually occurred
6559525 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6559526 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6559527 theyre supposed to water the site thats the law in every state
6559528 i havent seen watering truck one you see trucks carrying fuel to the dinosaur track hoes but i havent seen a single water truck
6559529 i thought i was coming down with a cold until i left town for the weekend and it cleared up when i came back i started coughing that scratchy feeling in my throat
6559530 i dont use air conditioning id been doing well enough through the heat by leaving windows open to let the trapped heat out my upstairs room i have to keep them closed when those guys are working now theres dust all over my floors furniture my clothes i feel like a prisoner in my own home it really sucks
6559531 to be perfectly honest with you i know very little about anything that youre describing right now
6559532 i did see the piece in the paper early on that the construction was ongoing saying that the folks in boylan heights were upset about the project but at that point it didnt have anything to do with any actual airborne sediment or anything like that the concerns seemed to be centered around the fact that they werent notified that this sort of construction was going to be occurring and the potential from it was what people were talking about i dont know of any complaints that weve received this is the first mention from anyone that there was an issue there so if youve spoken to people who have filed complaints and where have they filed them i would hope that if you would encourage them to give us a call give them our name and number i would appreciate that because quite frankly short of us happening to see the problem in the course of doing a routine inspection of the site which may or may not happen when we make a routine inspection of a site unless theres a heavy wind at the moment that would show the dust being kicked up and being carried off the site we wouldnt have any idea that it would lead to waterborne sediment you know where you get runoff during a storm event and most of our best management practices and measures are focused on that
6559533 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go

6559548 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of aug 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6559549 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6559550 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfilment
6559551 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals there have been what i would call some minimal movements to date

6559571 we have learnt the massive desertion of duties by our teachers with regret most of them have abandoned their jobs and are just idle in their homes doing nothing at the moment
6559572 its a pity but that is the reality on the ground we dont have teachers we are just limping in the affected mr akuku said schools as far as effective teaching is concerned
6559573 their turn up to register for a new contract is encouraging though a few others are still hesitant following unexpected salary dry up

6559580 um jogador que se adaptou facilmente ao esquema do muricy nos ltimos jogos ele decidiu muitas partidas para nossa equipe e faz a fun o de marca o no meio campo ele est sempre chegando ao ataque e finalizando bem um jogador que faz muita falta nossa equipe
6559581 por que voc fez a loucura de trocar o masculino pelo feminino
6559582 vou conversar com o presidente luiz estev o porque n o estou feliz no brasiliense da minha parte n o pretendo continuar isso uma decis o pessoal e n o tem a ver com propostas de outros clubes
6559583 n o cheguei a ver sa mos cedo do hotel e j viemos para s o paulo mas fazer o qu esse tipo de cobran a normal por parte da torcida n s temos que acatar
6559584 n o consegui dormir o time foi mal n o fez por merecer o resultado temos que lamentar pelos gols mas acho que ainda d para recuperar
6559585 estamos na zona de classifica o da libertadores ainda faltam muitas rodadas eles t m que incentivar porque sem eles vai ficar dif cil esse o grupo que o palmeiras vai ter at o final do campeonato brasileiro e com ele que n s vamos continuar lutando por uma vaga na libertadores e pelo t tulo
6559586 time grande assim j joguei no s o paulo sei como isso na poca a torcida at invadiu o ct para protestar aqui no palmeiras estamos todos preparados para isso e o time vai mostrar que tem condi es de defender essa camisa

6559595 every so often we see reports of this kind in the saudi media i believe its part of the saudi demonization of relations with israel
6559596 so far we have no human cases and thats why we want to provide prevention for west nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis
6559597 we notified emergency personnel clinton hospital and selectmen as soon as we found out
6559598 we recommend using repellents and removing standing pools of water from properties and anyplace water can collect such as in a birdbath or a tire so mosquitoes dont continue to breed
6559599 we go out once or twice a week we alert local health and let them know of any potential cases in the area
6559600 the majority of people who are infected with wnv approximately 80 percent will have no symptoms
6559601 and are you going to give the shots to your six year old
6559602 and its not a slam dunk the vaccine only protects against some of the viruses that cause cervical cancer so women still need regular screenings which is why some doctors are now asking if its worth it
6559603 most of the information people have right now leads them to believe that if theyre vaccinated with gardisil theyre protected for life and thats just not true
6559604 these reports are from conditions that have occured following the vaccination they do not neccessarily mean they are causally related
6559605 were being proactive here and are looking to make this business stronger by addressing redundancies and excess capacity

6559609 for sure last year kimi raikkonen was 17 points behind with two races to go and he won the championship so we cannot give up we need to be even more motivated i think we are there we are competitive so thats the only thing i want
6559610 that is sport sometimes we rely a lot on the car and on that occasion it was not possible because we had a failure but it doesnt change our way of working because we still have seven races in front of us
6559611 it was not nice for sure it was very sad for me to leave the race with so few laps to go but now im looking forward and trying to do a nice performance until the end of the season because we still have 70 points up for grabs and 70 points is more than the leader has now so it can be that we still have half the season in front of us in terms of points
6559612 i think it will be very competitive in most of the remaining races
6559613 get me back on my fucking bike so i can catch these motherfuckers
6559614 every 4 years we see pictures of smiling athletes with their successes and yet it is patently clear that standards are dropping when i see usain bolt and his two world records i feel it pertinent to point out that 19 30 seconds is probably equivalent to 23 when i was at school
6559615 it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying that
6559616 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6559617 although i wasnt convinced with zardaris arguments i went along i asked if the judges would be reinstated within 24 hours of impeachment and he said yes
6559618 its now his turn to support us on the reinstatement of judges
6559619 weve said its not a question of any individual its a question of the institution we should be clear about whether we stand for the independence of the judiciary or we stand for certain individuals

6559622 the russian defence ministry has telephoned the norwegian embassy in moscow
6559623 the russian ministry called to say moscow was going to send a letter to the embassy with this information
6559624 now the decision makers choose whether to give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down

6559638 those who hold the value of democracy as primary will be dissatisfied with the collaborative model it does not imply equal rights to power or processes of majority rule it does involve a radical challenge to hierarchy
6559639 i have to progress slowly but surely i thought if i went to west ham or chievo it would have taken me a long time to adapt im here with a coach i know and it will help me grow as a player before i go to something bigger

6559642 my name is allan and im an african giant pouched rat i am no standard rat however because i save lives im a herorat trained to sniff out unexploded landmines in africa every 20 minutes someone is killed or injured by a landmine often they are children my job is to find the mines before the kids do luckily i have two great advantages over the children the first is my nose i can smell explosives even when they are underground the second is my size im too light to set off the mines as a mine detector i have other advantages too im cheap i work for peanuts im easy to train and i dont mind repetitive tasks when trained i can clear 100 square metres in 30 minutes im working in our remote explosives scent tracing rest department this means i work in research with a new technology that will help identify the areas we should focus on those with mines and let the team know which areas are free of mines and can be released we will use this method most often in clearing roads roads that let aid in or roads that allow people to return to their homes at present we are testing this technology and evaluating how different soil weather and mines impact the results i live in tanzania where i was bred especially to become a herorat my trainer john will send you regular reports of my progress and how our research evolves i promise to do my best to make you proud of me with your support im sure ill soon be out there clearing roads finding mines and most important of all saving kids and innocent adults from injury or worse together we will save lives and limbs thank you allan
6559643 damn that was going on so well too and then they went and did that

6559645 marchar es muchas veces asumir un compromiso cuando uno forma parte de una sociedad uno debe manifestar sus opiniones sus ideas sus rechazos sus apoyos y esto es una forma de decir aqu estoy y me importa lo que est pasando esto le demuestra al mundo que esta es una sociedad que no se deja avasallar es decir no debemos movilizarnos s lo por una causa debemos movilizarnos para manifestarnos sobre las cosas con las cuales no estamos o estamos de acuerdo
6559646 el peor impacto pol tico de la existencia de las farc en colombia es que en nuestro pa s se ha perseguido sistem ticamente toda otra forma de pensar y sobre todo otras formas de disenso p blico
6559647 el problema es luchamos pero qu salimos y qu logramos la pregunta real es cu l es nuestro aporte en la construcci n de democracia en este pa s que como no logramos nada para qu salir a marchar es mejor quedarnos en la casa me parece que por lo menos el hecho de tomar la calle es importante los estudiantes tenemos el poder de hacerlo si lo podemos hacer activamente bien es la capacidad que tenemos y el derecho de manifestar nuestra opini n no es bueno pensar que no vamos a lograr nada y hacer voto de silencio
6559648 la primera cosa que debe hacer un comunicador y un periodista es aprender a diferenciar entre propaganda e informaci n y contarle a sus audiencias qu es propaganda y qu es informaci n no porque la propaganda sea mala sino porque la propaganda mal utilizada puede llevar a malos prop sitos
6559649 sobre las marchas lo que m s me llam la atenci n es que fueron convocadas por la sociedad civil y ver a las nuevas generaciones liderando este movimiento yo vi en la plaza de bol var universitarios j venes de todo el pa s nuevas generaciones comprometidas en hacer algo por el pa s y eso es fundamental estos nuevos j venes est n pensando en el pa s y est n usando la tecnolog a para crear pa s todo esto sociedad civil j venes y tecnolog a unida producen grandes resultados como lo demuestran estas movilizaciones
6559650 es la forma en que el ciudadano puede aportar un poco no a los estamentos pol ticos sino a manifestar sus sentimientos
6559651 los medios y en especial la radio sirven como mediadores para mi las voces del secuestro fue como una luz de esperanza
6559652 el activismo es lo que ha movido todas estas marchas es el deseo de comunicar una idea y expresarla en una comunidad estas marchas han tenido tanta acogida porque son humanitarias porque lo que est en juego no es dinero no son cosas materiales sino seres humanos
6559653 why am i not at the gershwin seeing wicked why did we spend money on these tickets precious money that could be going towards a ticke to a play why

6559657 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy

6559663 too much beach volleyball nbc would have done even better if they hadnt overdosed with that duo of kerri walsh misty may on the screen every night during primetime some nbc executives probably thought men want their t amp a every night but those women look like the jolly green giants

6559697 vorrei protestare per il modo in cui ha disegnato il mio guscio vedi appena mi abituo al mio rivestimento esterno ecco che devo abbandonarlo per un altro molto scomodo oltretutto una perdita di tempo
6559698 capisco ma ti rendi conto che proprio il lasciare un guscio che ti permette di andare a crescere dentro un altro
6559699 dora in poi il tuo guscio non cambier e tu continuerai ad essere cos come sei ora
6559700 contrariamente a quello che mi avevi promesso il mio guscio non rimasto lo stesso continua a restringersi sempre di pi
6559701 il tuo guscio rimasto della stessa misura quello che successo che tu sei cambiata allinterno del guscio
6559702 vedi tutto cambia continuamente nessuno resta lo stesso e cos che ho creato le cose la possibilit pi interessante che tu hai quella di poter lasciare il tuo vecchio guscio quando cresci

6559716 city parks provide hundreds of safe family friendly and anti crime activities for kids and families across indianapolis
6559717 thats why the mayors plan to privatize our parks and turn them over to private developers makes no sense
6559718 during his campaign mayor ballard promised higher ethical standards in city government but then he awards a no bid contact to venture real estate to inventory city parks for possible sale what makes matters worse is that this same company will then get a cut of money from those sales
6559719 this not only is a huge conflict of interest and but its also an ethically questionable move by the mayor
6559720 our parks are one of the citys most valuable assets so it makes no sense to sell them off to the highest bidder
6559721 this backward plan will have a devastating impact on the quality of life in neighborhoods across our city this is a proposal right out the mitch daniels steve goldsmith privatization playbook
6559722 we dont have beaches mountains or oceans so indianapolis has to compete with what we do have neighborhood parks and arts and culture cutting arts and parks makes indianapolis a less desirable city to live work and raise a family

6559747 we would of course welcome that the areas are genuinely used
6559748 i think everybody has the right to speak this is not the same as demonstrating
6559749 the detention and harassment of those who tried to take the government at its word shows the lengths to which the authorities will go to keep people from peacefully expressing their views

6559751 while the purpose of the edchoice program is to allow students from chronically distressed public schools to attend private schools our research indicates that those underperforming public schools are showing improvement as well

6559753 i know it may surprise some that i would support a school voucher program but i am proud to do so
6559754 coach erik gerets has been very clear with him and has told him that players will continue to be recruited and that the majority may be ahead of him

6559769 the corruption investigations have caused people just to rethink what theyre going to be doing i think the vast majority of voters today dont know how theyre going to vote
6559770 the only republican who can win in november and live to carry on the fight against the liberals in washington
6559771 i think as people have got to know me in the campaign they know thats not true and the interesting thing about all that is the justice department has now filed a motion they said theres no legitimate doubt that ted stevens lives full time in washington d c i live full time in anchorage
6559772 this year what one sees is the blossoming of trees planted in 84 and 88

6559775 and i just took a deep breath after i cried because i knew it was the last lap of a 54 year race
6559776 this has been a victory for barack and his family because they have run a very astute smart well thought through campaign
6559777 it was a victory for the civil rights struggle because the fruits of our labors have produced the platform from which he could be launched and win and its a victory for america this is a redemptive moment for america its a transformative moment
6559778 and i felt that the value of keeping the party together was worth the hit that we took
6559779 you can agree to disagree but theres a higher prize
6559780 they were our liberal allies we assumed that once we made a great break politically they would be with us
6559781 but once we moved to self determination a number of our allies backed up they wanted to represent us not be our partners in politics
6559782 i said somebody has to run and in the meantime the crowds around run jesse run kept getting louder and louder
6559783 registering voters was winning bringing in new people was winning learning how to run a convention on the floor was winning having our own trailer was winning having access to the mic was winning having access to the national press corps was winning having our issues on the front line was winning so we began to define winning in many long range terms
6559784 you look through the tv lens and you see blacks in chicago unemployed you think they are lazy they dont want to work
6559785 they came to work the jobs left they see you through the tv lens youre not working they think youre getting a subsidy because you feel privileged you get a subsidy because the big farmers corporate farmers took your farm you guys have an awful lot in common
6559786 the farmer said to me you know we hear what youre saying and we think youre right
6559787 and we shook hands i embraced their children i kissed their children
6559788 their children 24 years later are there now because of a cultural transformation in our society because america is becoming more mature less anxious less reactive on the question of race and gender
6559789 people begin to get used to seeing a person of color on that stage debating these issues

6559795 well you know clearly he must acknowledge this is a high point in americas struggle to make this a more perfect union its a time to heal the breach
6559796 theres unfinished business i am not at all romantic about the structural inequality and the gaps yet to be closed and the healing that must take place but were getting there
6559797 i think that what barack must show is that from the vantage point of that mountaintop how to get all of us into that promised land

6559841 de unos a os a esta parte el mantenimiento de los aviones se ha reducido de forma preocupante
6559842 antes del despegue un t cnico de mantenimiento daba lo que se llama vuelta de reconocimiento al avi n para comprobar que todo estaba correcto ahora un administrativo a menudo eventual y con una formaci n de dos horas es el que se encarga de algo tan importante

6559850 after four years of trying to get the current government and the public to recognise this its very encouraging to get a report written for our main transport agency saying the same thing
6559851 the public has already voted with their feet and started leaving their cars at home public transport in auckland and wellington is bulging at the seams at peak hour
6559852 we simply dont have the services and the government is still planning in its latest land transport to spend eight times as much on new roads as it does on public transport
6559853 i said i was going to call the police and then she went nuts she said she was going to kill me
6559854 i pushed her away and tried to climb back in the truck she slashed my arm twice as i pulled the door closed and she continued to stab the window once i was inside
6559855 now that ive had time to think about things i feel a bit freaked out about what could have happened
6559856 what we now see is some idea within the fiji interim government that they can get a new constitution without any proper process
6559857 i dont think there is anything inherently bad about fijis constitution or electoral laws
6559858 the point is the commodore has decided he doesnt like it its no way to change a countrys fundamental laws like electoral law just because a person decides he doesnt like it
6559859 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6559860 if only i could become a bird one of them i wouldnt frighten them and i could show them the way to warmth and safety

6559862 yes you have enough i have supplied all your needs according to my riches in glory
6559863 the reality is that water quality in the region has been declining so keeping stock out of rivers and streams is an essential part of reversing this trend
6559864 its easier to protect clean water near the start of rivers and streams than deal with dirty water in the lower reaches of waterways
6559865 isso gerou uma revolta com a categoria porque tanto trabalho para mudar essa imagem que n s t nhamos e em poucos cap tulos a novela mostrou uma s rie de coisas erradas como funcion ria falando ao celular que era carregado por ela

6559871 their foot movement is amazing the three of them akhil vijender and jitender also have the right attitude to excel at the top level
6559872 before going to jakarta for the asian games we had a week long camp in kolkata the railway carriage was our hotel but mosquitoes there feasted on us most of the time we were half asleep during our training sessions the rs 5 daily allowance was obviously not sufficient
6559873 just see the present crop and how they are doing us proud in china they got foreign exposure and better facilities these things can make a difference
6559874 in 1955 i asked for a training facility at the central railways workshop in parel a toilet which was not in use was cleaned and given to me
6559875 oil stocks had fallen quite sharply during the decline so theres a bit of a relief rally going on right now
6559876 those stocks have been pounded when they consolidated i think you had a lot of shorts that were willing to cover
6559877 talk of a possible lehman takeover was one of the catalysts for the turnaround it looks like there is some bottom fishing going on
6559878 another nail in the coffin for stocks in the near term
6559879 the back to school season is a perfect opportunity to begin or continue greening efforts at your school whether public or private large or small school greening efforts offer educational environmental and economic benefits for the whole school and community
6559880 i dont have a license im not old enough to vote im a junior in high school

6559882 were creating some good habits that will go throughout the lifetimes of these young folks so may be when theyre adults we wont have the crisis we have now
6559883 in the state of maine we are able to collect blood from 16 year olds and we have seen an increase in the number of units of blood coming in
6559884 yesterday a youtubed audio snippet of barack obamas defense of his vote against the illinois state legislation that required medical providers to give normal life supporting medical care to infants born alive during an abortion appeared on several blogs
6559885 should have a double digit lead over mccain at this stage as has been the case with previous presidential primaries
6559886 diverse nature of nordsons businesses and end market exposures provided the basis for our ongoing record performance
6559887 sales continued to grow at double digit rates and operating margin continued to improve expanding to 18 in the current quarter from 16 in the same quarter a year ago
6559888 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
6559889 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
6559890 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6559891 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6559892 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6559898 we all get along really well off the field so its nice to see that transfer on to the field and really improve our team chemistry were all looking forward to what the season will bring
6559899 playing both florida and denver right off the bat will be a good way to see what we will be made of this season
6559900 with three freshmen in the starting lineup florida will be a great test for us and denver game is always a tough and fun matchup
6559901 okay so they don t need to have used those exact words but even saddam hasn t said we plan to nuke the usa
6559902 once the united states believes it has both a strong spear and a strong shield it could lead them to conclude that nobody can harm the united states and they can harm anyone they like anywhere in the world
6559903 tuitions expensive where im going and the cost of gas i spend like 100 a week just getting there
6559904 you can offer people salaries you can offer people bonuses but the fact of the matter is if people see opportunities or real career paths for themselves that will attract people not only to come here but for people to stay here
6559905 it will not be big surprise if growth will be slightly lower than what was forecast eight months ago
