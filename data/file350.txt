3500000 those are the two things that stand out to me about tonights game and thats what we continue to emphasize around here winning edges
3500001 thats something our line takes a great deal of pride in keeping our defense fresh
3500002 converting on third and 1 is like making a statement tonight was nothing i havent seen from michael bennett before he just works hard and doesnt complain hes consistent and before you know it hes going to give you that big run
3500003 everyone in this room already knows how good michael bennett is
3500004 hes fast hes strong and hes got good vision fundamentally this was a very good game for us no penalties or turnovers thats what you want we didnt do the little things that get you beat in this league
3500005 we got into a good rhythm and when other guys came in they did a great job too
3500006 we had a good running game going tonight were going to watch the film today and there will be a lot to build on i thought we looked pretty good out there
3500007 it feels good to say i played my first game as a pro
3500008 just like i expected the speed of the game in the nfl is a lot faster
3500009 you really wont know until you sit down and watch the tape but id say it was ok
3500010 its only one game but our line has taken an extra step
3500011 we kept converting on short yardage tonight and we did it convincingly where you dont even have to bring out the sticks to measure
3500012 they were all young last year and they kind of got thrown into the fire and did really well now theyre a year older and adding jeff faine at center really helps the offensive line should be one of the strong points of our team all season long
3500013 im just a journeyman according to some people why should i have any hard feelings im thankful to have this job
3500014 i might pay bruce and jon for bringing me out here
3500015 ive never been involved in a game like that before as a pro going wire to wire with no penalties or turnovers
3500016 those are the two things that stand out to me about tonights game and thats what we continue to emphasize around here winning edges
3500017 thats something our line takes a great deal of pride in keeping our defense fresh
3500018 converting on third and 1 is like making a statement tonight was nothing i havent seen from michael bennett before he just works hard and doesnt complain hes consistent and before you know it hes going to give you that big run

3500029 i just couldnt get myself into shape we italians havent got used to competition in the morning
3500030 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3500031 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3500032 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3500033 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3500034 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3500035 obviously to hear his voice and get leadership from him meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys
3500036 he just told us it will be difficult but together were going to be much stronger
3500037 he knows we need him im sure his interests are conflicted hell be back when hes ready
3500038 we didnt know if it was something related to u s athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know it was

3500041 mccutheons a wonderful passionate loving coach who cares about his team and about what were trying to build and develop here
3500042 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3500043 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3500044 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3500045 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3500046 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3500047 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3500048 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3500049 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing

3500069 my best guess is that womens hormone levels are timed to the birth and mens hormone levels are tied to their partners
3500070 a validation of the experiences that men know they have had it also goes a long way to bumping testosterone off its pedestal as the only hormone that is important to men
3500071 men are much more androgynous than we think we have the capability to be aggressive and nurturing the traditional view of men as predominantly aggressive really sells men short and denies their capability to experience the range of human emotions

3500135 in a purely economic way businesses are the end users of the products of the educational system unless the schools can train and develop multitudes of talents and strengths in children business will not have a good stem line of employees developing strengths is not a feel good false praise program instead it is challenging the premise behind it is that if you see what your strengths are in your relationships your activities and your own learning then they become your responsibility to develop them that is a big responsibility that takes work and dedication so businesses have an economic interest in an educational system focused on strengths it is my belief that because they hold this interest they can become persuaded to use their influence to help change the current educational system this can happen on many different levels and be taken up as part of any corporations social responsibility program many businesses today have thriving social responsibility programs what better place to focus than on developing strengths ultimately it will be a win win for families businesses and most importantly the children

3500196 the dollar is probably where it should be as it has made us products competitive in a world where global trade is central to economic growth
3500197 us growth is doing much better than domestic spending would indicate both because exports are booming and because some of the weakness in domestic demand is being passed on to the rest of the world through lower imports
3500198 while rapid export growth has been a crucial support to the us economy that now appears under threat as the evidence from europe and japan shows a rising threat of recession

3500205 since the fed stopped publishing m3 which tracks the total supply of dollars in the economy we cant even be sure how many dollars they are creating reported inflation is around 2 but the method for calculating inflation changed in the 1980s largely at mr greenspans urging private economists using the original method find actual inflation to be over 10 which matches more closely the pain consumers in the real economy feel the reality is that this type of manipulation of the markets masks where resources or money ultimately comes from it comes from the taxpayer the government doesnt create gross domestic product they just limit and control how it is done they then absorb much of the value produced in the economy through taxation and inflation so they can squander our nations wealth with runaway spending the fed tries to keep up with governments spending habits but is sending inaccurate signals to mask bad monetary policy ultimately well get back on track financially only when government spending is held in check and the free market controls monetary policy not the other way around

3500229 whenever something wonderful enters the scene which will prove to shake the established foundation of people making money in any form there are those who get mad in some instances furious this has been the case with the program because it seems at first glance to counter the vehicle known as the refinance which so many mortgage professionals are fond of i mean you come to them and provide them with incredible incomes in regular cycles every 5 7 years you refinance and for many of us far sooner than that this is money a mortgage professional can count on year in year out because we get ourselves in debt and then attempt to get out of debt by borrowing more money i know i know it doesnt make sense but thats what we do conditioned response drilled into us by the professionals and the lending institutions think about that for a second billions upon billions of dollars in profit are made every year due to our habits and the mortgage you have on your home is engineered to pay the lions share of the interest based on that habit alone why would any professional want to mess with a cash cow system like that what the professionals are finally starting to realize is that this system of paying off your mortgage and any other debt is beneficial not only to their clients but to their own businesses as well the versatility of the program caters to both pros trying to get their cliebts out of debt as well as those seeking to invest their clients equity in simple terms its a pair of gloves which fit both hands screaming about online good question we have some thoughts for you to consider about thsoe online trying with their words to slam this wonderful program helping american and canadian families there are many professionals out there on the internet who see this program as a threat the sad reality is it wont matter what we say they simply see us as people who are taking away business from their business it doesnt matter if they have never met you or ever would you are their potential client and so they take what we do as offensive we dont find any problem with anyone trying to make a living nothing wrong with that or with people who say they want to compete for your attention these people simply have something else to sell you their own program ideas or investments and frankly they want your money fine what we want is to provide you with a service which gives you the freedom to make the choices for yourselves and have complete control over your own life and funds one of the most common attacks is on an agents lack of background in the financial field to assist a home owner as if being licensed in some professional field was the only way to make the sale legitimate hmmm what about those of us who use the program prosper because of the program and have hard rock solid proof that it works would you want to know about it of course you would what makes many professionals angry is ufirst agents can be soccer moms cab drivers and cartoonists pay a one time fee and offer this to their friends and family across the country in any state without license restrictions financial professionals may be limited to a one or a few states while we can grow without bounds the rabid dog there are also individuals and small groups online who have no other purpose than to rend people limb from limb they exist to fight cause conflict and have nothing constructive to say only that their own view is the only view again thats fine but you need to watch the patterns of these individuals specifically because they are caught up in their own hype grandeur and testosterone to care about you or what happens to you we liken these people to rabid dogs if you talk nice to them they bite you if you feed them they bite you if you try to soothe or pet them they bite you its all they want to do bite you so when you read of people who are so adamant about bashing the money merge account we suggest you take some time and look into the backgrounds and associations of these posters where do they reside what is their language like and who are their associations and affiliations a great deal can be said by the company they keep it doesnt really matter what side a person is on the one common factor all opposition uses to get to their end result is riding on the successful coat tails of ufirst and the money merge account getting out of debt is such an important subject at this stage in our country and economy it draws in a lot of curious readers who hear about us and our program these nay sayers then use the internet to jump into the fray and stir the waters to get your attention and pull you to the side its almost like a feeding frenzy of sharks and the unfortunate side is there are casualties we hope this gives you a heads up on what to look for when researching on the internet and how to spot those with ill intent make decisions which are good for you whether you purchase the money merge account or not it doesnt matter as much as doing whats right for you and your family

3500239 even though summerslam is this sunday new world tag team champions were crowned as well finding out what was in kanes burlap sack here is how everything went down
3500240 first off kelly kelly saw one on one action as she took on the glamazon beth phoenix who was escorted to the ring by her new boyfriend santino marella even though kelly kelly gave the glamazon a good fight the glamazon made quick work of her after the match santino wanted phoenix to do more damage but kofi kingston and mickie james came down and chased the two lovebirds out of the ring shortly after santino issued a challenge to the wwe womens champion and she quickly accepted however being in her hometown of richmond virginia wasnt enough motivation as she was defeated by santino thanks to a little help from the glamazon santino and the glamazon will be facing the intercontinental champion kofi kingston and the wwe womens champion mickie james in a winner take all intergender match and the winning team gets both the intercontinental and the wwe womens title i think that santino and the glamazon just added fuel to the fire in this rivalry
3500241 then cryme tyme saw tag team action as they took on rory and robbie a k a the highlanders rory and robbie were determined to prove that being on hiatus didnt get them any ring rust however the team was no match for jtg and shad who thanks to their amazing teamwork picked up the win cryme tymes in ring skills are improving more and more each time i see them sooner or later we may see them as number one contenders for the world tag team championship
3500242 then john bradshaw layfield had a special challenge that he feels the world heavyweight champion cannot win
3500243 then jamie noble was defending the honor of his sexy lady friend layla as he was taking on the 2008 king of the ring winner william regal who interrupted laylas dance performance last week noble was still willing to prove himself to layla by defeating regal but he couldnt do it as regal made quick work of noble and won the match layla you can do a lot better than this guy noble if you know what i mean
3500244 then in the main event for the world tag team championship the champions john cena and batista who are going to face each other one on one for the first time ever at summerslam were to defend against the former champions ted dibiase and cody rhodes with their match at summerslam this sunday it was quite clear that cena and batista could not function as a unit at all as batista nailed cody rhodes with a spine buster he goes over to cena to make a tag by slapping him in the face then when cena confronted batista rhodes rolled cena up and got the 3 count making rhodes and dibiase the world tag team champions for 2nd time which led to cena and batista brawling on one another john cena and batista in my opinion is the summerslam main event and not one of the other two world championship matches

3500382 an updated interim analysis of the data collected to date from our clinical trial on the adequacy efficacy and safety of our softpap r collector compared with the standard spatula cytobrush technique remains very promising based on an interim review of 485 patients from a total trial of 702 patients we have found the softpap statistically significant in superiority to the spatula cytobrush in reduction of false positives an indication where the patient has been inaccurately diagnosed with cancer symptoms we are also very encouraged by the trend we see in softpaps reduction of false negatives an indication where symptoms of cancer are detected by softpap and not detected by the spatula cytobrush we anticipate that the trial will be completed and final results will be available within weeks

3500403 the jewelry and watch report 2007 a consumer insights study of the jewelry and watch market
3500404 2006 will be known as the year the jewelry industry finally discovered the mens market
3500405 men have traditionally been the biggest purchasers of jewelry while women are the most important consumers of jewelry that hasnt changed in 2006 but what is notably is how strongly the market for mens jewelry grew mens fine jewelry defined as jewelry made from precious or semi precious stones and or 10k or above gold sterling silver or platinum is no longer a step child in the jewelry business but makes up about 10 percent of the overall jewelry market
3500406 jewelry shoppers in their search for higher quality merchandise and more fashion forward designs found that the service and expert advice available in jewelry stores was exactly what they needed
3500407 sterling jewelers reported 14 9 percent revenue growth in their most recent fiscal year to reach 2 652 million in sales which put them into the coveted first place as the nations top jewelry store clearly specialty jewelry retailers like sterling jewelers are aggressively pursuing the jewelry consumer marketplace and are not willing to give up share to less specialized retailers such as discounters
3500408 if i were a watch marketer this attitude so prominent about young consumer would keep me up at night it is esstential for watch marketers to position their brands as fun and functional rather than push the status button too strongly young consumers embrace a much more casual lifestyle so the idea of a watch as a status symbol just doesnt connect
3500409 currently about 15 to 20 of patients dont respond to standard therapy for depression and these data dont capture all patients with trd since there isnt really a clear definition of what trd is which leads providers to misdiagnose and or not provide proper management of the condition consequently educating primary care providers nurses and psychiatrists on identifying diagnosing and managing trd appropriately is crucial
3500410 treatment resistant depression is a common problem where a relative minority of patients are completely well on their first regimen several studies have shown that incomplete recovery from depression leads to increased risk of relapse and poorer outcomes
3500411 aggressive treatment of refractory depression is a priority for our field but the options for treating patients are still poorly defined because depression is so common research and education regarding difficult to treat depression should be one of our highest priorities
3500412 the collaboration between dbsa and these prestigious organizations will ensure that providers receive education that will enhance their overall approach and communication with those living with trd
3500413 at mj we believe that a critical success factor in the development and implementation of effective medical education resides in a collaborative framework where each partner brings their core competencies to the table
3500414 for many of these patients having been in pain for such a long time a certain desperation develops for even a modest degree of relief it is this desperation that also leads to the suicide risk in these individuals especially after having failed yet another course of treatment having a coherent reasoned and evidence based strategy to approach the treatment of all forms of depression especially the resistant forms is essential if we want to have a positive impact in the lives of our patients

3500449 enterprises are experiencing an increasing overlap in management activities of telecom wireless and network performance so its important our efforts evolve to meet their needs as well

3500451 the report illustrates that elite performers in enterprise network performance management have distinguished themselves in five core best practice categories people process data management technology and reporting this group has separated themselves from the rest of the pack by minimizing network downtime and reducing variability for the mean time to resolve network issues they leverage technology sound business processes and people to achieve better results

3500473 we must always be concerned when an administration seeks to rewrite the rules months before they leave office
3500474 i wrote the endangered species act and seeing it signed into law was among my proudest moments as a member of congress the changes sought by the bush administration would seriously weaken the law eliminating the requirement that scientists be the ones making decisions regarding science instead giving political hacks and unsympathetic bureaucrats another opportunity to attack the scientific community it is remarkable that this bill signed into law by richard m nixon and accepted for decades as a pillar of american conservation would be destroyed by george w bush in the final months of his administration it is most peculiar that a statute which has done so much good should be now jeopardized by the stroke of a hostile presidential pen

3500570 its bad enough that congressman kenny hulshof wants to continue gov blunts failed policies but the last thing he should do is use gov blunts campaign money to try and get elected
3500571 only a washington politician like kenny hulshof would promote the current governors policies take his money and then try and distance himself from gov blunts unpopularity having congressman hulshof or the political party that he now controls indebted to gov blunt would be bad news for missouri families
3500572 what would it change if we didnt accept the money nothing
3500573 jay nixon has made it clear that hes running against matt blunt
3500574 well and thats just it the politics of the past vs the direction of the future when youve offered nothing new or no solutions to the challenges of our state i mean jay nixon is the poster boy for the politician the dated politician of the past we want to take our state forward
3500575 27 weeks that have passed since congressman hulshof promised to address the health care crisis in missouri
3500576 during that time jay nixon unveiled a detailed health care agenda how can congressman hulshof say this with a straight face
3500577 jay nixon after having three years to run for governor has a 265 million dollar mathematical error
3500578 that 265 million dollars youve got to fund it every year
3500579 what hes not telling you is those federal matching funds require state resources to draw down those funds if he says any different hes lying jay nixon cannot be trusted on healthcare policy none of it can be taken seriously based on a massive miscalculation when he rolled it out
3500580 while congressman hulshof has been part of the problem in washington these past 12 years attorney general nixon has stood up to the oil companies here in missouri
3500581 in washington congressman hulshof gave billions to the big oil companies and what did missouri families get in return skyrocketing gas prices needless to say thats not the kind of change we need

3500606 usually when you finish something you let it sit for a couple of days and then look at it early last week we read through the script and we not only liked the new work we saw how much it needed a new title
3500607 the song bounce is no longer in the show but the tune is
3500608 its slightly amended and it has different lyrics i utilized the tune with some variations and a new lyric
3500609 two divergent aspects of american energy the builder and the squanderer the visionary and the promoter the conformist and the maverick the idealistic planner and the restless cynic the one who uses things and the one who uses them up
3500610 this is closer to what we started with than anything weve done since
3500611 there was always a road image the boys start off with their pioneer father on his death bed telling them to follow the road of their dreams
3500612 in fact there is an actual road in the climax of the show an extraordinary road designed by addison and given wilsons promotional push that would lead into boca raton from the outside world 16 lanes wide this in a day with very few automobiles motorized gondolas palm trees bands
3500613 the whole idea of the road has persisted so when john and i got finished with our final tweaks we realized we needed a title that reflected the journeys of the show
3500614 a lot of people will think im sure that we just cant make up our minds thats why we keep changing titles it is quite the reverse in fact its knowing exactly what we think the show is about and i think a title is to inform an audience if an audience comes to a show called bounce and thats not what its about and theres no song called bounce it seems to me extremely misleading thats why were calling it road show and there wont be a title tune it describes to an audience what theyre going to see it also suggests the loose structure of the piece
3500615 out of sams version id say half the songs are still in the show and a number of songs from this last version
3500616 from this last version from bounce theres one song that has been rewritten for another spot and theres the opening number which has very much the same tune but entirely different lyrics you could call those hold overs otherwise id guess without going through the scorecard there are more songs from the hal prince version than from the sam mendes but its actually an amalgam of the two as well as a couple of new numbers or actually a couple of ones written before sams version
3500617 the song bounce is no longer in the show but the tune is
3500618 its slightly amended and it has different lyrics i utilized the tune with some variations and a new lyric
3500619 over the last three years john weidman and stephen sondheim have done transformative work on the project we have now re titled road show
3500620 john doyle has assembled an extraordinary team of actor singers and i am confident that the result will be a revelation
3500621 spanning 40 years from the alaskan gold rush to the florida real estate boom in the 30s road show is the story of two brothers whose quest for the american dream turns into a test of morality and judgment that changes their lives in unexpected ways
3500622 because its so lovely here at this time of year
3500623 but i dont and ill never lose enough weight in time i dont want to look mumsy but what choice do i have

3500625 its grey but she uses a non permanent ash brown shade from boots to touch up the roots which looks good however her hair was thick and had no shape
3500626 i took an inch off which made it more adaptable and feathered it into a softer frame for her face because she is going sailing i created a style that will dry naturally i recommended she use hair products with a uva factor such as lor als solar sublime range and stressed the importance of rinsing out salt water
3500627 for this holiday hazels skincare regime needs to emphasise sun protection rather than make up
3500628 i would recommend a high protection product such as la prairies cellular anti wrinkle sun cream in spf 30 she should use it on her face d colletage and shoulders and wear a wide brimmed hat
3500629 for the shoot i focused on her ashore look i began with guerlains terracotta moisturising bronzing powder on her eyes i blended a deep golden brown from the shiseido eyeshadow duo s11 and used artdeco waterproof eyeliner in black 10 finishing with cliniques gentle waterproof mascara in black i applied cliniques lip gloss in bonfire 07 which has an spf of 15

3500655 this current unacceptable situation affects us all to a lesser or larger extent the benefits of a windfall tax would affect us all too and i would urge the government to levy this windfall tax as soon as possible

3500676 you should venerate not only the icon of christ but also the similitude of his cross for the cross is christs great sign and trophy of victory over the devil and all his hostile hosts for this reason they tremble and flee when they see the figuration of the cross this figure even prior to the crucifixion was greatly glorified by the prophets and wrought great wonders and when he who was hung upon it our lord jesus christ comes again to judge the living and the dead this his great and terrible sign will precede him full of power and glory cf mt 24 30 so glorify the cross now so that you may boldly look upon it then and be glorified with it and you should venerate icons of the saints for the saints have been crucified with the lord and you should make the sign of the cross upon your person before doing so bringing to mind their communion in the sufferings of christ in the same way you should venerate their holy shrines and any relic of their bones for gods grace is not sundered from these things even as the divinity was not sundered from christs venerable body at the time of his life quickening death by doing this and by glorifying those who glorified god for through their actions they showed themselves to be perfect in their love for god you too will be glorified together with them by god and with david you will chant i have held thy friends in high honour o lord ps 139 17 lxx
3500677 the author is acting like a tour guide through this ancient monastic work which embodies traditional orthodox piety in fact having read the
3500678 baptism is no guarantee that we will ascend into heaven a good beginning does not absolutely ensure a good ending
3500679 violence and unending pain are the lot of those who aim to ascend to heaven with the body and this especially at the early stages of the enterprise when our pleasure loving disposition and our unfeeling hearts must travel through overwhelming grief toward the love of god and holiness it is hard truly hard
3500680 the kingdom of heaven is for the violent and the violent take it by force
3500681 the sufferings of this life are nothing compared to the glory which will be revealed in us on that day
3500682 each command gives us an opportunity to cut off our own will to humble ourselves to refrain from argument and judgment to abandon our own thoughts and to fulfill cheerfully the instructions of another
3500683 a traditional means of reminding us that it is lent are the lenten foods thus even at our meals we are reminded that prayer and penance should be practiced during these days perhaps the easiest lenten food to serve every member of the family is the pretzel it sounds surprising but the pretzel has a deep spiritual meaning for lent in fact it was the ancient christian lenten bread as far back as the fifth century in the church of that century as today the lenten fast consisted of no milk no butter no cheese no eggs and of course no meat so they made small breads of water flour and salt mainly for the children
3500684 to remind themselves that lent was a time of prayer they shaped these breads in forms of arms crossed on the breast in prayer as we do when we approach the chalice to receive holy communion

3500688 the latins have erred greatly and many times the whole choir of fathers do condemn them he who communes with the latins is grouped with heretics and separated from christ and the saints
3500689 we have turned away from them as from heretics and for this reason we have separated from them for what else the rules of piety are clear he who even in the slightest deviates from right faith is a heretic and subject to the laws set against heretics thus they are heretics and as heretics we cut them off
3500690 the lord has seen fit to allow for heresies to spread to the greater part of the inhabited world as with arianism at one time so too today with papism
3500691 that one must not accept blessings of heretics which are rather folly also could be translated as to ones ruin rather than blessings
3500692 the commandment of the lord is not to remain silent in times when the faith is in danger
3500693 if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out
3500694 if there are any monks in our day they will be proved by their works the work of a monk is to not tolerate any innovations whatsoever as pertains to the gospel that they not become examples to laymen as proposing heresy and communion with heretics for they will give account for their the laitys loss of salvation
3500695 do we prefer the monasteries more than god and happiness here more than hardship for the sake of the good

3500702 i can remember coming here in april as a player when its cold or going to wrigley its not always been packed like this so were fortunate we play in a place where everything you do theres interest rather than complain i guess this would be the flip side of it every game seems important day game after a night game you need to show up and play because theres a lot of people that are going to come in here and care about how you play thats a good thing

3500725 one has the strong impression strong to the point of certitude that the good shepherd psalm is the best known most frequently prayed and the most widely memorized psalm of the bible
3500726 the popularity of this psalm is doubtless related to the traditional attraction of the image of jesus as the good shepherd the latter a fact readily demonstrable from the new testament and the very earliest christian art
3500727 in the traditional exegesis of the church this psalm bears special reference to the sacraments of initiation baptism chrismation and the holy eucharist
3500728 this interpretation is already clear in mark 6 the earliest written account of the multiplication of the loaves above we noted marks insertion in 6 34 of a passage from ezekiel on the theme of the good shepherd also we saw this reference to the crowds reclining on the green grass even though the event takes place in the desert the latter detail surely taken from our psalm but in this same passage mark likewise regards the multiplication of the loaves and hence of the good shepherd through the lens of the eucharist note for instance marks use of the four eucharistic verbs in verse 41 to describe how jesus took the bread blessed broke and gave it to the believers such is the mystic tables that the good shepherd having led us safely through the valley of the shadow of death prepares before us beside the still waters our heads anointed with oil
3500729 just as human affection when it abounds overpowers those who love and causes them to be beside themselves so gods love for men emptied god phil 2 7 he seeks love in return and does not withdraw when he is treated with disdain he is not angry over ill treatment but even when he has been repulsed he sits by the door cf rev 3 20 and does everything to show us that he loves even enduring suffering and death to prove it
3500730 and he himself tempts no one but each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin and sin when it is full grown brings forth death
3500731 the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord tormented him
3500732 god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity god gave them up to dishonorable passions god gave them up to a base mind and improper conduct
3500733 god sends upon them a strong delusion to make them believe what is false so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness

3500741 eva and victoria are obsessed with the game and spend most of their evenings going out for a civilized meal and then getting stuck into a meaty tournament but they realised there are no venues which provide dinner and focus on this new hollywood craze so when eva said she was opening a new branch of beso in the gambling capital of the world victoria had the brainwave of turning it into a place which specializes in food and their favorite game eva will oversee the restaurant while victoria channels her energies into the casino

3500753 what caught my eye was that the information being used by the immune system was a negative kind of information
3500754 the writings of the new testament are already such interpretations written in the context of faith in the one whom god raised from the dead their status as interpretations cannot be bypassed in an effort to seek the supposed historical core and then subject it to other interpretative frameworks the real jesus inscribed in the writings of the new testament is already interpreted and to understand him more deeply we must turn primarily to the symbolic world of scripture in and through which christ is from the first understood and explained revealed
3500755 for irenaeus the canon of truth is the embodiment or crystallization of the coherence of scripture read as speaking of the christ who is revealed in the
3500756 i think one has to be really careful about what is meant by
3500757 now turning to basil yes basil points to all sorts of things which are non scriptural in the sense that scripture does not explicitly state them eg facing east when praying etc but note how he explains them we face east when praying because eden was planted in the east also note what he says in sec 16 of on the holy spirit but that it is simply the tradition of the fathers is not sufficient for they too followed the sense of scripture taking their principles from the testimonies which a little earlier i extracted from scripture and presented to you so yes we have a rich and vast tradition of reflecting on the mystery of christ a treasury from which there is always more for each and every one to draw and so in this sense the word grows as it says in acts but it stays the same word nevertheless
3500758 as in the last days the word of god which was clothed with the flesh from mary proceeded into this world and what was seen in him was one thing and what was understood was another for the sight of his flesh was open for all to see but the knowledge of his divinity was given to the few to the elect so also when the word of god was brought to humans through the prophets and the lawgiver it was not brought without proper clothing for just as there it was covered with the veil of the flesh so here with the veil of the letter so that indeed the letter is seen as flesh but the spiritual sense hiding within is perceived as divinity
3500759 the word of god is incarnate in the writings of the law and the prophets though the words of scripture veil the word of god yet at the same time they alone provide the means by which the word is known it is not possible to arrive at the spiritual sense of scripture in any other way than through the words of scripture themselves thus in his scriptural exegesis origen always begins with the literal or lexical sense before exploring its spiritual sense and as we have seen the veiled content of scripture is identical to the truth taught by christ which is christ himself
3500760 i really want to have a drink of this water and i want to go to this pasture and i need a shepherd to look after me
3500761 what have i done here im not a member of the church i dont even believe in god and ive done this thing what does this mean have i received communion or have i merely had some wine or have i committed some blasphemous act
3500762 ill send you a form and we can make you an appointment
3500763 if this act has occurred then this is an act that has to do with me and the church and where is that church
3500764 well as it happens ive been going to see an orthodox bishop and ive been preparing to be received into the orthodox church
3500765 you can talk to him i dont think you need to make an appointment just give him a ring and see
3500766 ive done a terrible thing i drank from the communion chalice and i dont even believe in god and i think that im in a mess and whats the state of my soul i need you to make sense of this for me
3500767 if you didnt believe in god you wouldnt be so worried
3500768 for where two or three are gathered together in my name
3500769 trinitarian theology is embarrassing and we dont really know what its all about
3500770 well no whatever that was you know im not going to look into it too much but it did happen to me
3500771 christianity thats not for me because im not good enough
3500772 there cant be a god because if there was a god then why is there all this suffering and death
3500773 no look basically im one of those guys that you dont want to be around you may have to think about this again
3500774 i really am a christian not just orthodox im an orthodox christian
3500775 this is about the only way that a christian can get himself persecuted these days you know by wearing one of these things
3500776 so what are you saying you think youre better than me
3500777 be ye therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect
3500778 you never believed in me while you were alive you therefore will go to hell for eternity
3500779 god is the lord and has revealed himself to us
3500780 evangelism is the fruit of repentance in orthodox soteriology christians are not justified by a legal fiction and then imputed an equally fictitious righteousness cf st anselm instead salvation is sacramental union with christs divine nature restoring our wills and actually becom ing holy in spirit and in truth this is the free gift of god but we must actively accept this grace
3500781 the result of this is joy and peace in the spirit this state of blessedness the orthodox church affirms is attainable in this life and it is the inherent attractiveness of this state that draws people to the church that is to be united to christ through his body moreover it is a state of being filled with all the fulness of god of being shot through with his glory hungry souls who are seeking god intuitively know when they have found the genuine article as it were and ultimately it is god who is attractive to seekers to use biblical imagery when they find the pearl of great price they sell everything they have to attain it
3500782 orthodox evangelism consists primarily in not getting in the way of this pearl which is god
3500783 the ascetics are orthodoxys only missionaries asceticism is her only missionary school orthodoxy is ascetic effort and it is life and it is thus by effort and by life that her mission is broadcast and brought about
3500784 before taking it upon oneself to be a teacher of righteousness theres a place for seeking purification and divine illumination that doesnt come in a moment or without struggle we believe that the fruit of the holy spirit love joy peace patience kindness and the rest if given a chance to grow in us will make a greater impact in the lives we touch than a recitation of the romans road or the four spiritual laws so our approach to evangelism begins by seeking purification from the passions and cultivating the virtues that make for our own sanctification and full salvation
3500785 therefore you shall be perfect just as your father in heaven is perfect
3500786 take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men to be seen by them otherwise you have no reward from your father in heaven therefore when you do a charitable deed do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory from men assuredly i say to you they have their reward but when you do a charitable deed do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing that your charitable deed may be in secret and your father who sees in secret will himself reward you openly
3500787 those who walked in darkness have seen a great light

3500909 we felt it was prudent at this time for each of us to sell a small portion of our holdings in transact to recoup a portion of the cash taxes we had to pay on the vesting of the restricted stock over the last several years
3500910 we both retain significant holdings of stock in the company and remain very optimistic about our business and the future of transact technologies
3500911 although our revenues for the three months ended june 30 2008 were disappointing we are confident that next quarters revenues will be higher additionally we are pleased that we have been able to maintain our very low operating expenses and that our gross profit margin has increased to 99 for the three months ended june 30 2008

3500913 we remain committed to defining and executing strategies that provide the greatest value driven growth opportunities for semotus and its shareholders and will continue to move forward with this objective firmly in focus

3500925 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3500926 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3500927 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3500928 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3500929 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3500930 bei uns h uften sich die beschwerden von friedhofsbesuchern dass bei den wenigen wasserstellen in st peter kaum gie kannen aufzufinden waren
3500931 wir haben lange berlegt wie wir diesem problem entgegenwirken k nnen und sind auf einem friedhof im salzburgischen rauris f ndig geworden

3500941 obviously the games very passionate and we dont want to take that away
3500942 were all looking for that consistency across the board from the players the referees and from the panel whore making these decision so everyone has a big role not just the players
3500943 i think its unfair to single out chelsea or myself thereve been hundreds of occasions where other teams and other players as well as myself and chelsea have overstepped the mark
3500944 i think we all hold our hands up to that
3500945 we have reached the stage where the whole situation needs correcting
3500946 at times and this came into sharp focus last season incidents crop up where the mark is overstepped and player and manager behaviour can become unacceptable
3500947 the referees have a responsibility too in forging better relationships with team captains and the other players and by communicating in the right way it will help the players and that will make the game better for everyone
3500948 we need the excesses skimming off the top it is difficult to say that without making it appear that we are trying to sanitize everything
3500949 that is not what we are saying at all we want the passion and rivalries what we dont want is some of that blatant disrespect and abuse
3500950 weve all seen where we want to go and stop surrounding referees the respect is definitely there
3500951 referees have got a tough job and dont have access to replays we realize that
3500952 it wont be matey matey now there will still be the tempo the aggression that makes this the best league in the world the premier league is the best for those reasons and we need to get a balance
3500953 i certainly hope im in the hat whoever the manager decides its going to be an amazing day for that person
3500954 the clock is running make the most of today time waits for no man yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift thats why it is called the present
3500955 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3500956 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3500957 the opportunity to join a leader in the seacoast market is one i could not pass up
3500958 the internet provides tremendous educational opportunities for children yet there are also many potential dangers that our kids face online
3500959 parents need to know how to keep their kids safe online and we hope they will use all the resources available to help protect their families
3500960 we encourage parents to talk to their children about safety on the internet and all computer users to follow basic steps to protect themselves online
3500961 today the internet has radically changed the dynamics of bullying cyber bullying is a growing problem nearly one in six us children grades 6 ten is a victim each year
3500962 social networking web sites chat rooms instant messaging and blogs are likely areas where this could occur
3500963 cyber bullies aim to intimidate harass belittle and hurt people
3500964 if parents are aware of the signs that their child is involved in cyberbullying they will be able to make better choices and help protect their child
3500965 the cable public affairs net will air the 60 minutes edited version followed by the full 90 minute interview to give viewers a window on what is left on the cutting room floor
3500966 as he gets more comfortable in the system he starts to settle and get in a groove he was third string but he kept pushing and pushing staying ready five weeks into the season he was our starter
3500967 on tuesdays last season we were getting after the scout team pretty good
3500968 he can move the pocket hes good enough to flick the ball around and find guys any time you have a quarterback who can move it around thats a problem for you as a defense
3500969 its hard because his instincts are to go out be a playmaker like going out on a fastbreak rather running set offense
3500970 he has to get his eyes down the field his eyes are still too much looking at the blocking i think craft is further along in that regard

3500978 its obviously a broad announcement with lots of notebooks with lots of new features but the real story is the consumer influence on the enterprise product line
3500979 dell has made improvements with the battery life and they talked about security and manageability but what i thought was interesting was the fact they were using web cams different colors and just from a segmentation standpoint they had 10 new products there and thats really broad for a commercial lineup
3500980 delivering silver or black boxes is just not the right answer today so were trying to figure out how commercial customers use their machines not only from a business perspective but from a personal perspective

3500992 its a sad situation all around but its a good final resolution to a sad situation
3500993 mr critchley did not intentionally plan to hurt anyone was not intoxicated and was acting with the express or apparent implied consent of numerous other local entities and government officials

3500996 you have to recognize what these teams have done in the past but the present and future are what i am looking at terrible offensive line holes in the defense a quarterback who was drafted way way to high the wrong starter at runningback and mediocre depth nolan will have this team winning in a couple of years but definately in the bottom 10 teams
3500997 if im having to explain to myself why i think im a hero i guess im not a hero

3500999 she doesnt actually say some things she makes you feel uncomfortable with the way she is acting its all a game she creates rows i think

3501004 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game

3501012 ive never really been out there as a fully fledged recording artist and performer because of my love for producing and writing now
3501013 we started them because we had friends who were big fans of frosting but not necessarily cake
3501014 we started doing frosting shooters with friends and then we put it on the menu for 75 cents who doesnt love frosting
3501015 its kind of the cut to the chase evolution of cupcakes
3501016 i can imagine it being at parties its a great thing to have at an office party it provides just a little bite of sweetness and yumminess without going whole hog
3501017 we have a lot of regulars who know which flavors we offer on what day and theyll come in on saturdays because they know thats the day we have raspberry buttercream
3501018 i see fingers getting involved but theres no shame we dont judge here at sprinkles
3501019 you order the cupcake but you really want the frosting
3501020 it brings you back to when you used to lick the container or whatever your mom made it in
3501021 this is like a classic food trend a lot of people are thinking of the same thing at the same time which is really how most food things start
3501022 were not talking molecular gastronomy its kind of reducing down to the basic element of what a cupcake is
3501023 it really became a big thing i tried to stop offering them
3501024 but i would see people on the street and theyd be like where are the frosting shots they would get on my case about that
3501025 we tried to think of what we could do why would people come in the evening they tend to come during the day and could go somewhere else and have a cocktail
3501026 i think its the connotation of its a shot and what in the world is it people are just curious

3501031 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3501032 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3501033 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
3501034 unlike some other health care trend surveys aon consultings survey reports the expected future increase in employer provided health plan claims cost before any plan changes based on the opinions of health plan actuaries
3501035 we provide this trend data to help employers evaluate the competitiveness of health insurance premium renewals for employers with self funded health plans this trend data helps them develop future claim estimates for budgeting purposes
3501036 but more must be done to truly stem the tide of rising health care costs
3501037 this includes greater senior management support for these programs better employee communications and more consistent cooperation from the medical community

3501041 the focus of the air force leadership has drifted with respect to perhaps its most sensitive mission
3501042 a substantial number of air force general officers and colonels potentially subject to disciplinary measures ranging from removal from command to letters of reprimand
3501043 individuals in command and leadership positions not only fell short in terms of specific actions they failed to recognize systemic problems to address those problems or where beyond their authority to act to call the attention of superiors to those problems each had the leadership responsibility to identify and correct or flag for others the structural procedural and performance deficiencies identified in just a few weeks by adm donald
3501044 years ago the career path for air force personnel in the nuclear field was well established and prestigious however the overall mission focus of the air force has shifted away from this nuclear mission making it difficult to retain sufficient expertise
3501045 first fixing the structural procedural and cultural problems and second ensuring accountability
3501046 to evaluate each of the individuals identified by adm donald as bearing responsibility in the recent incidents and systemic problems to determine whether and what disciplinary measures are warranted and whether or not they can be part of the solution to the problems identified by the investigation
3501047 while at amp t does not fundamentally oppose the transaction and believes competition benefits consumers the regulatory process must be consistent for all providers
3501048 we will continue to urge the sprint nextel and clearwire to the same competitive analysis standard under which it reviews all other carriers
3501049 transparent attempt to use the commissions spectrum screen to hamstring prospective competition to at amp t
3501050 claim before the commission that they really have only 55 5 mhz of useable spectrum for competitive evaluation purposes while simultaneously claiming before the investment community and the securities and exchange commission that their spectrum holdings will be at least three times that size
3501051 at amp t fails to point to a single competitive harm that would arise from the new clearwire transaction
3501052 allowing market forces to determine the manner in which clearwire should offer its services
3501053 game the regulatory system to tie down other market participants with regulatory encumbrances while leaving its own networks and lines of business unregulated
3501054 is not in the same category of spectrum as the pcs cellular smr and 700 mhz bands that have been subject to the commissions cmrs screen in prior cmrs mergers
3501055 new clearwire will face competition from 4g service providers using 700 mhz spectrum
3501056 those who would prefer to preserve their marketplace positions are permitted to hinder the emergence of a strong broadband third pipe
3501057 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more

3501059 the weak dollar has become a major driver of economic growth

3501073 this is a mammoth patch tuesday and we have not seen anything of this scale in a long time
3501074 anything new is a two edged sword and criminal attackers are getting very good at exploiting the internet for information and for creating markets
3501075 microsoft and nbc are doing a lot of things to provide a lot of information about the olympics online and its common sense that the criminals will leverage that
3501076 its not up to the level of the hype about it
3501077 the bad guys work closely and its important that security vendors do so as well
3501078 that type of leadership role is important for large vendors to assume if and when they can

3501113 when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3501114 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3501115 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3501116 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3501117 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3501118 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3501119 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3501120 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3501121 i can say its gonna be unlike anything else thats on fox and maybe on cable
3501122 why would i want to do that why would i go back to telling everybody in the world how much money i make and barely surviving to have some obscure cabinet post and have some 20 year old from the white house telling me what im gonna do

3501128 a women who is abused by her husband is truly placed in a situation of double jeopardy regarding hiv infection in that his sexual behavior outside of the marriage makes it more likely he is infected with the virus and his abusive behavior inside the marriage leaves her with little control over sex or sexual protection
3501129 those clinicians working to prevent hiv infection among their female patients should consider violence from male partners as an important risk factor and ask about and attempt to intervene in such abuse to reduce this risk
3501130 more critically major national and global hiv prevention programs must include reducing mens ipv perpetration as a key target in the fight to stem the epidemic
3501131 this study should serve as a wake up call to us all if we as policymakers and practitioners are going to be truly successful in addressing the spread of hiv in india we must think of ways to address the all too widespread mistreatment of wives

3501140 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3501141 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3501157 both georgian authorities and ossetians everyone who values human life and peaceful development of the country to spare no effort to cease fire and solve disputes peacefully
3501158 georgian authorities stand for peaceful settlement of the conflict and are ready to carry out the policy of peace i hope the ossetian party will not exacerbate the situation centuries old friendship and family relations bond georgian and ossetian people and what is most important we united with christian faith and must live peacefully without blood
3501159 i learned about armed clashes in tskhinvali and its localities and i urge the opposing parties to cease fire and renew the dialogue
3501160 today blood is shed and people are killed in south ossetia and my heart deeply laments over it orthodox christians are among those who have raised their hands against each other orthodox peoples called by the lord to live in fraternity and love confront each other

3501162 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
3501163 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
3501164 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once
3501165 ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so
3501166 happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalised
3501167 there is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being happy

3501199 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3501200 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3501201 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3501202 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time

3501227 when we removed the caps from one of the saf split block bearings it was completely loose on the shaft
3501228 that made it necessary to replace the shaft because the loose bearing caused it to wear excessively
3501229 the bearings are completely assembled and lubricated so we just slid them onto the shaft and tightened them in place
3501230 our service instructions call for tightening until there is no clearance between the adapter sleeve and the inner ring and then tighten one more turn the overhung load of the large blower made it difficult to determine that point once we got it as close as we could we tightened the locknut a bit more and the spyglass oss window on the bearing indicated we were at the correct torque
3501231 sometimes what you dont know might end up being better for you
3501232 for years patients have been told that early cancer detection saves lives find the cancer before the symptoms appear the thinking goes and youve got a better chance of beating the disease
3501233 so it might have seemed surprising last week when a panel of leading medical experts offered exactly the opposite advice
3501234 screening tests dont only pick up life threatening cancers they pick up tumors that look identical to traditional tumors but they dont have the same biologic behavior said dr

3501276 moultrie ceo of the facility group of smyrna ga pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly and unlawfully rewarding an agent of mississippi government with a gratuity which he apparently hoped would get him in good stead with musgrove if he should need him later
3501277 t his is a charge that he made the contribution intending to influence and reward the official for the performance of official duties should the public officials assistance be needed on any potential problems on the mississippi beef project
3501278 have you ever given or received a 25 000 tip for work left undone
3501279 ronnie musgrove effectively passed the 55 million tab onto mississippi taxpayers while accepting a 25 000 tip for his campaign coffers did musgrove think no one would catch it and if so can he be trusted not to do something like it again

3501289 current drugs given to people with lewy body and parkinsons disease simply treat the symptoms
3501290 this model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
3501291 further research using these models will enable us to find new drug targets people with lewy body disease suffer memory loss visual hallucinations and movement difficulties
3501292 unfortunately research is severely underfunded and much more is needed if we are to defeat this devastating disease

3501316 there is a still lot to be done here in new brunswick and its all about money and time science and education
3501317 its a never ending process because we are into environmental and climate change
3501318 we keep looking ahead to see what are significant areas that we might want to help protect that wouldnt get protected otherwise
3501319 a lot of those are on the tidal shores because there is a lot of change and erosion that goes on there others are on rivers and lakes
3501320 this is a site of international importance in the migration of hundreds of thousands of shore birds
3501321 this is just one of the examples of the kind of work the nature conservancy of canada does
3501322 this is the birds last refueling stop before flying 4 300 kilometres non stop over the ocean to south america

3501326 that is another huge milestone for me i cant even explain
3501327 ancora oggi non riesco a dimenticare ci che accadde quella sera nana cant la canzone di nobu ancora priva di testo aggiungendovi delle parole in un inglese incomprensibile e io divenni prigioniera di quella voce come se un misterioso incantesimo mi stesse avvolgendo nella sua spirale il tavolo come palcoscenico il cellulare come microfono e la luna crescente come riflettore lunica persona al mondo in grado di praticare questo tipo dincantesimo nana di questo sono convinta ancora oggi
3501328 era lestate dei miei 20 anni mi sentivo una persona vuota e mi ostinavo a riempire quella lacuna con una sola cosa lamore
3501329 lultima cosa che ricordo il bicchiere con le fragole che cade sul pavimento era speciale lavevamo comprato insieme io e hachi ne avevamo preso uno a testa quel bicchiere mi chiedo se sarei riuscita ad afferrarlo se lo avessi voluto sai hachi io non ero in grado di capirti del tutto valgo poco come quei due bicchieri da pochi soldi non potevo accettare lidea di perdere tutto pi facile sopportare il dolore di una crepa che si apre lentamente io ero cos fragile ma la colpa non era tua

3501331 i think of all my pot smoking friends who dont go to hempfest because its not their culture
3501332 it was a dream come true just to race here
3501333 was to reach over the table and punch the doctor who was giving me the news
3501334 if certain tests had come back elevated my parents would have stepped in
3501335 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3501336 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment please leave me alone
3501337 should go back to making tea for brian mulroney and stay out of serious peoples business
3501338 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3501339 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3501340 you hear the conservatives refer quite often to unelected senators she is an unelected senator appointed by brian mulroney put in the cabinet by stephen harper and regarded by many as being brian mulroneys proxy in that cabinet and therefore when i used that term i was talking about doing mulroneys bidding
3501341 it doesnt really make sense bottom line is he should have admitted he was wrong off the top and apologize to her
3501342 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3501343 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3501344 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3501345 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3501346 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3501347 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3501357 because it was so close to my home i grew up shopping at irvine spectrum center and still visit the center when i m excited to return to my roots and participate in the first ever style week orange county
3501358 spectrum draws sophisticated shoppers and trend setters from my hometown of laguna beach as well as newport beach and other areas of the region
3501359 we are thrilled to participate in the first ever style week orange county
3501360 our irvine spectrum customers love fashion and this is a perfect opportunity to share what
3501361 h amp m is excited to be a part of the first ever style week orange county and irvine spectrum center is a great place to showcase h amp m
3501362 we love our orange county shoppers who are among our most fashion savvy customers
3501363 we had our annual memorial day bbq the usual uninvited bugs came out in force we decide to try out the bug bam products we recently received within moments the annoying pests were gone the product did its job and what my guests and i also appreciated was how easy to use this all natural product is
3501364 in oklahoma we have mosquitoes the size of small sparrows i never heard another complaint after the bug bam arrived
3501365 not only did bug bam work it alleviated some of our main concerns regarding the insect issue the prevalence of malaria and the evening inundation of insects into our one man tents
3501366 the people ive spoken with their views of the crop are certainly dramatically different than what these yields today say and what the conditions say theyre much more cautious and much more conservative
3501367 i talk to people who tell me about how bad their drowned out stalks are everyday
3501368 its important to note that most of that unexpected production gain was offset by higher demand and the fact usda pegged ethanol demand at 4 1 billion bushels this year infers to me there will be at least 4 5 billion bushels for the 2009 2010 campaign
3501369 obviously the usda has confirmed how nice the crop looks but in the final analysis we dont think the net yields can be that high
3501370 people are heading for the exits right now and asking questions later and when this ends grain prices should begin rising

3501373 we believe that ubs investment bank will be not fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3501374 no specific plans to dispose of any business unit at this time
3501375 by separating the business units they are showing that they are listening to investors but not going as far as breaking up the universal bank business model
3501376 talent in private banking is rushing out the door to competitors who are taking advantage of the banks difficult situation

3501385 paul why is your nose bump bleeding all over the place
3501386 the doc said if i went to a dermatologist they would shave it off i thought id save a few bucks and do it myself
3501387 the audacity of hope thoughts on reclaiming the american dream
3501388 i think the olympic stage has always been huge the fact that its in beijing china in 2008 with world conditions as they are magnifies it incredibly
3501389 i dont know anything about angola but i know theyre in trouble
3501390 you hit me ill hit you even if it doesnt look like hes eaten in a while
3501391 and thats what the olympics is about really supporting your country and then seeing people who are really great at what they do
3501392 and get an opportunity to watch what they do thats special
3501393 first of all on behalf of my teammates we want to say the angolan team really played hard tonight really came out and made us play our a game we just want to thank them for playing a good hard game
3501394 were very honored as nba players to be here first of all and to get the reception weve got everywhere weve went china has been unbelievable to us
3501395 ill tell you now there wont be any nonsense that ill stand for we will not put up with any nonsense dont ever embarrass me because ill never embarrass you that goes for me and coach k and our country
3501396 youre either in or youre out if you cant meet any of these requirements youre out
3501397 ive got plenty of guys who want to put on the uniform
3501398 cadets will receive excellent training from skilled maritime professionals on a variety of seagoing vessels
3501399 weve also decided to create a single product portfolio and go to market strategy around small business explained andrew sage ciscos vice president of worldwide small business sales
3501400 we will continue to have the cisco brand and the
3501401 by integration we mean they were going to be taking both of those to market through a single channel program through a single sales team and through a single field organization
3501402 generally these solutions are going to be differentiated in terms of expandability modularity customization
3501403 so the linksys switching family will have fewer options less configurability than the 2960 for example another way to differentiate will be around the support experience the support around a linksys solution will be very different from the support on the cisco solution because the customer expectations are very different the final difference will be the price points
3501404 berichtete ulrike sch mann wir sind einfach der meinung dass die zusammenarbeit f r die n chsten tage nicht mehr zielf hrend ist die berlinerinnen wollen sich im endspurt wieder auf die eigenen qualit ten besinnen und rechnen sich trotz bislang durchwachsener serie immer noch medaillenchancen aus zwar belegt das trio drei tage vor dem finale nur den elften platz unter 15 ynglingen doch der ist in der realit t mehr wert als auf dem papier tats chlich trennen die deutschen seglerinnen nur vier punkte vom bronzeplatz das ist nichts das k nnen wir noch schaffen
3501405 could result in an adaptor onto a hp or ca product
3501406 the great thing about my character this year is that hes all over the map in terms of his internal conflict
3501407 the sort of orders that hes given by certain people who have power over him this season and the situations that that puts him in really really force him to employ a kind of restraint that you havent seen him necessarily need to employ
3501408 saya menangis karena saya bahagia bahagia krena tuhan yesus telah menyelamatkan anak saya

3501411 obviously the games very passionate and we dont want to take that away
3501412 were all looking for that consistency across the board from the players the referees and from the panel whore making these decision so everyone has a big role not just the players
3501413 i think its unfair to single out chelsea or myself thereve been hundreds of occasions where other teams and other players as well as myself and chelsea have overstepped the mark
3501414 i think we all hold our hands up to that
3501415 we have reached the stage where the whole situation needs correcting
3501416 at times and this came into sharp focus last season incidents crop up where the mark is overstepped and player and manager behaviour can become unacceptable
3501417 the referees have a responsibility too in forging better relationships with team captains and the other players and by communicating in the right way it will help the players and that will make the game better for everyone
3501418 we need the excesses skimming off the top it is difficult to say that without making it appear that we are trying to sanitize everything
3501419 that is not what we are saying at all we want the passion and rivalries what we dont want is some of that blatant disrespect and abuse
3501420 weve all seen where we want to go and stop surrounding referees the respect is definitely there
3501421 referees have got a tough job and dont have access to replays we realize that
3501422 it wont be matey matey now there will still be the tempo the aggression that makes this the best league in the world the premier league is the best for those reasons and we need to get a balance
3501423 i certainly hope im in the hat whoever the manager decides its going to be an amazing day for that person
3501424 if i were only allowed to do one thing it would be directing
3501425 i obviously didnt want to make a movie that was making fun of war or soldiers the idea was to make fun of actors who go off to make war movies and think theyve had some kind of real experience based on that
3501426 jack blacks character for instance you look at farley and belushi and some of these funny guys who had drug problems and some made it and some didnt and theyre not obvious places for humor but in this satirical idea of the movie we could do it
3501427 saya nggak boleh egois saya punya penggemar toh video klip saya beredar di mana mana dengan baju terbuka juga
3501428 the presidents of the european court human rights have granted interim relief to gary mckinnon for a period of two weeks until 28 august 2008 for the application to be heard before the full chamber

3501449 de bemiddelaar heeft eerst proberen uitzoeken waar het tot nu is misgelopen en zal op basis daarvan voorstellen doen
3501450 wat we tot nu toe gehoord hebben bevalt ons wel maar er ligt zeker nog geen akkoord op tafel het zal nu wachten zijn op een concreet voorstel van de bemiddelaar om te zien of een oplossing mogelijk is
3501451 allereerst moet er op zeer korte termijn iets gedaan worden aan de werkdruk die moet omlaag
3501452 daarnaast is er dringend nood aan een diepgaande discussie over de organisatie van het werk wij denken aan een groep van luchthavenarbeiders die de verschillende diensten zou overkoepelen en waar bij piekmomenten in een of andere dienst uit geput kan worden nu duurt het veel te lang voor er gereageerd wordt bij een personeelstekort

3501454 so although habits are changing a good girl doesnt partake in alcohol
3501455 even if a restaurant offers it on its menu the waiter may have to pop down the road to fetch and dust off a bottle from elsewhere in the big cities you will find there is more choice leaving you free to join indias young and upwardly mobile in nightclubs and bars where you can enjoy a drink and a spot of public humiliation on a karaoke machine in the coastal resorts that cater increasingly for package tourism you can now buy cocktails sit back to chilled out music and watch the ocean while drinking something that looks like the bottom of a pond with a cherry in it
3501456 but for women the backpack wardrobe is not so simple apart from the fact that most of us would hate to have to wear the same pants for days on end there are matters of respectability men can show arms legs and chest without gawps marriage proposals and offers of jiggy jiggy for women however while covering up from neck to toe is unnecessary there are certain social conventions of which to be aware especially if visiting a holy place and to make life easier careful selection of clothes will enable you to use minimal space in your backpack
3501457 on arriving in any town or village it is a good idea to make a mental note of any visible public toilets apart from normal use in good health you need to be prepared for the ominous fact that you may at some point have to run or speed waddle the 100 metre dash if you should contract a bout of delhi belly
3501458 obama is currently facing an underground campaign of racial and religious attacks from sources outside conventional media and outside the campaign management of candidates he is also subject to a deliberate orchestrated and sytematic personal attack from his opponent including attacks that have included false charges included in ads that have been run and rerun on television news shows at no charge to mccain without aggressive and simultaneous refutation of false charges as in the wounded troops case
3501459 the target is barack obama and while it is his job to run his campaign it is our job as columnists reporters editors and publishers to find and report the truth and whether the charges in campaigns of personal destruction are true or false
3501460 its senseless when you see it whoever it was was just malicious
3501461 it was just mean stuff was torn up torn over thrown around and my mother was hit it appears viciously hit
3501462 you dont want to go out and buy a gun to defend yourself but when this is going on on a regular basis it might come to that

3501465 good example of the over hysteria i was speaking about
3501466 everybody is worried about wicker park being made out to be some kind of disneyland when its just a dumb neighborhood with a lot of bad artists
3501467 this is not paris in the 20s its really not
3501468 let the presidential candidates gov sonny perdue and other politicos sing the glories of homegrown resources and energy independence let al gore and leonardo dicaprio make all the movies they want about global warming hardly anyone is buying it

3501480 if chambliss had done a better job standing up for georgia families he wouldnt be in this position
3501481 instead hes become a washington politician supporting the economic policies that have gotten us into the mess were in now
3501482 jim martin is in a strong position because hes offering a real alternative taking away tax breaks for oil companies standing up to special interests controlling spending in washington and fighting to make the economy work for the middle class again
3501483 georgians are not happy with where saxby chambliss has taken their state and their country and theyre eager for change
3501484 with the general election only beginning a week ago jim martin is in position to mount a strong challenge
3501485 we never made any donations sir i have no idea what you are talking about
3501486 because we want to scare people into thinking the black guy wants to rape their young white daughters so they took a while to answer finally they came up with this lame excuse

3501490 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3501491 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3501492 it looks like the whole state is corrupt all the time you dont want to be considered like louisiana or newark or chicago
3501493 he has served alaska for 40 years but his time is over
3501494 i would definitely say that people arent as excited about going to minneapolis as they were about going to new york city
3501495 minneapolis is a nice city but it doesnt quite have the environment and reputation of a new york city and i think 2004 was a unique convention and a lot of it had to do with where it was
3501496 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3501497 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3501592 voting registration over the last four years have been trending heavily democratic
3501593 there are about 19 000 registered republicans and 18 200 registered democrats four or five years ago there was a much bigger disparity
3501594 with more and more registered democrats and people realizing that republican state leadership has been completely ineffective people are starting to realize it is time for a change in frankfort
3501595 my message has resonated well ive talked to lifelong republicans who are tired of the ineffective republican politicians that have been in office we had a republican governor and a republican senate and people know that we were treading water when we should have been blowing through water

3501636 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
3501637 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused clearly its not

3501647 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3501648 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3501649 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3501650 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3501651 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3501652 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3501653 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3501654 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3501655 i am proud to have been chosen to sing at all
3501656 canada should reject that person as a potential canadian citizen
3501657 concern is the small minority of new immigrants who are here out of their own free will but who demand the full benefit of the canadian charter of rights and the full protection of canadian laws without being willing to assimilate into this society or even show the courtesy of respecting and following its norms and traditions some even show an attitude of defiance to the social traditions of this country
3501658 we must ask whether it is acceptable for canada to lower the standard of human rights for immigrant workers simply because they are being provided with an opportunity that is potentially beneficial to them
3501659 people choose to live in canada because it is one of the best places on the planet to live yet they cant wait to show pride and love for the place they chose to leave

3501664 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3501665 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3501666 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3501667 there was lip syncing in the olympics opening ceremony the fireworks were made by a computer and sports are a dispute over the best doping id rather read a book
3501668 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3501669 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3501670 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3501671 your volleyball season is about to start and i know you want to learn the secrets of how the pros play like they do strengthen and improve your volleyball skills while playing for your high school and club team now learn early what indoor and beach volleyball olympians and professionals know about 1 the importance of gaining muscle strength for injury prevention gaining speed and increasing your vertical jump while training for volleyball 3 mental conditioning and gaining confidence in yourself and your game on and off the court

3501678 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3501679 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3501686 fha has long had a prohibition on anyone party to the transaction contributing to the down payment
3501687 over the years it has been apparent that loans utilizing seller funded down payment assistance have a high default rate and have had a very negative impact on the fiscal soundness of the fha fund in may of 2006 the irs published a revenue ruling expressing concern that seller funded down payment organizations may not meet the irs criteria for 501 c 3 status the irs is currently in the process of reviewing these organizations and has begun withdrawing the charitable status of those which do not meet the necessary criteria

3501693 metaphors are a divinely given means to avoid idolatrous claims of knowledge metaphors are non literal descriptions of reality they are an acknowledgment that we need to access the world around us in an indirect fashion and that the idea of direct and complete access is an arrogant illusion that violates the multifaceted integrity if the created world
3501694 the degree to which we openly express our feelings should be governed not by fear of reprisal but by our commitment to loving others
3501695 music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy
3501696 no matter how together we may appear even to ourself buried deep within our heart is the vague sense that something is wrong dreadfully wrong
3501697 we were designed to love and when we do something good develops inside we feel clean rich whole even better we become less concerned with how we feel and more concerned with the lives of others

3501700 we think we know what we are doing we have always thought so we never seem to acknowledge that we have been wrong in the past and so might be wrong in the future instead each generation writes off earlier errors as the result of bad thinking by less able minds and then confidently embarks on fresh errors of its own

3501787 these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species
3501788 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3501789 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3501790 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations

3501829 les ambassadeurs du motel was een groot orkest dat in le motel speelde dat was een soort nachtclub waar veel belangrijke regeringsleden en buitenlandse diplomaten kwamen we speelde wat muziek naar ieders smaak gaande van pure pop over afro cubaanse dingen tot puur malinese muziek het was wat men noemt een vari t orkest maar we durfden zelfs jazz aan als men ons daarom vroeg
3501830 ik ben eigenlijk gitaar beginnen spelen omdat het een instrument was dat me toeliet om tegelijk te spelen en te zingen eigenlijk ben ik ook altijd al een fan geweest van jimmy hendrix john lee hooker en andere amerikaanse gitaristen de blues fascineerde me enorm en de gitaar is natuurlijk ook familie van de ngoni een traditioneel malinees instrument

3501835 we kenden zijn muziek hij had onze muziek gehoord en is ons komen opzoeken omdat hij absoluut samen iets wou opnemen
3501836 kijk un dimanche a bamako blijft natuurlijk een album van amadou amp mariam voor dat album waren we ook al populair dus we zien het eigenlijk meer als een natuurlijke evolutie van ons werk
3501837 ik denk van wel ja dat heeft vooral te maken met een niveau van concentratie dat wij in ons werk kunnen leggen
3501838 the need to belong in groups is paramount to young learners and exclusion is something they see as the end of the world

3501985 for him maworere and part of his development as a player who wants to go to the next level giving him the responsibility of captain will hopefully benefit him not only our team but his development as a player and a leader
3501986 i want him to take on a little bit more of that role of needing to be that man every single game because thats one of the things were going to ask of him
3501987 gift has the great ability to be a disruptor at midfield he destroys other teams attacks because hes such a hard tackler hes good in the air hes strong and fit and covers so much ground
3501988 hes one of those players that a lot of times is undervalued because you dont see him doing a lot of things that show in the box score
3501989 he takes up good spaces on the field he covers the forwards and other midfielders very well and he protects the back four so well his ability to disrupt and destroy opposing teams attacks is what makes him so valuable
3501990 both have played a good amount of minutes for us brooks played quite a bit last year as well but i think those two are going to make it difficult for somebody else to take their position on the field and thats a good problem to have
3501991 i think one of the toughest formations for a midfielder to play the three man midfield because they have to be able to cover a lot of ground and be technically sound on the ball
3501992 i think their coll and silva growing up in the game and understanding of it are going to help them be better adapted to make that change immediately both are technically sound and very good on the ball and thats two of their best attributes the two of them as freshmen will have the knowledge and ability to quickly adjust to it theyre both athletic kids and very fit kids and theyre savvy enough as internationals to direct other people what to do and where to go and thats going to be a big benefit to us
3501993 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3501994 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3501995 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3501996 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3501997 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3501998 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3502001 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3502002 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3502037 tegemist on metsamaaga mille kasutamise tasuks pakuti umbes 18 000 krooni hektari eest see on selgelt ebapiisav sest liini all metsa kasvatada enam ei tohi metsamaalt ei tule ju aga tulu he korraga lageraie puhul vaid aastate v ltel

3502119 in the past few months there have been several news stories concerning the dispute between
3502120 all this has understandably led to confusion among the fans and the focus seems to have drifted away from the musical aspects it is therefore time to get back on track and release this little update on the progress of the next album from the

3502128 the russian invasion is not about south ossetia it is about regime change in tbilisi reimposing a 19th century sphere of influence in the south caucasus limiting the autonomy of the countries there and through all these devices maintaining control of energy transmission lines to the west

3502132 two million indians constitute the best immigrant community in u s
3502133 7 6 lakh visas are being issued every year and in a few years from now we would be issuing 10 lakh visas every year

3502136 since 1980 there have been talks of why india was unable to produce a gold medal though it had a population of one billion and abhinav bindras success has put an end to that drought
3502137 we are also taking a list of senior citizens particularly those above the age of 80 years jail superintendents and medical officers have been told to interact with these inmates and submit recommendations on the extra care or facilities that can be extended to them
3502138 we are considering those who never had visitors over a period of one year as an orphan

3502140 this movie made me cry yet made me happy somehow
3502141 the job of a director is to make people bloom
3502142 today when we are marketing cinema and even lives and values to make a film on special children is truly an act of courage
3502143 constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india
3502144 it is important that an enabling environment free of violence is created to sustain the peace process and address the long standing dispute of jammu and kashmir
3502145 people used to say i didnt know how to run a government
3502146 if theres still some damage well assess the loss and pay full compensation on the pattern of relief provided to other states in case of such circumstances
3502147 since it is responsible for holding the ground in rural kashmir and for securing the loc but no one in the government acted
3502148 assured them of pakistans full moral and diplomatic support to the kashmir cause
3502149 regretted the excessive use of force by the indian security forces against the kashmiri people and called for an immediate end to violence in jammu and kashmir
3502150 the aggressor has been punished and has suffered considerable losses his armed forces have been disorganised
3502151 we are not pushing the valley into pakistans hands it was after a landslip and a blizzard had killed amarnath pilgrims in 1996 that the nitish sengupta committee was set up it recommended the setting up of the amarnath shrine board that was done by the farooq abdullah government following this there were two judgments of the jammu and kashmir high court on the subject those were being implemented when the peoples democratic party went back on decisions taken by its own ministers and the congress caved in
3502152 this was a bogey raised by separatists to justify their march to muzaffarabad
3502153 the home minister was talking the language of the separatists
3502154 why wait for 35 days before talking to the amarnath sangharsh samiti in jammu
3502155 those kashmiris who want to cross over to pakistan should be pushed there and never allowed to come back
3502156 the status quo in south ossetia and abkhazia is no longer possible
3502157 the invasion plan was rehearsed and perfected during georgian american war games in georgia
3502158 the government of india is working at wiping out the hurriyat leadership
3502159 he is a very good boxer but i knew that i would score
3502160 it will be a tough fight but i am here to win the gold i am ready to face the world champion because i want to be the no 1 in the world i will show this on august 15
3502161 he was good he used good technique and great tactics he was better than me
3502162 he is a class boxer just look at his determination
3502163 you got to attack if you want to score points
3502164 i just wanted to be out at the 50m point and thats where i was
3502165 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3502166 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3502167 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3502168 i am delighted i couldnt care less about the time
3502169 an olympic gold is an olympic gold the time the race none of it matters its all about the gold

3502171 there are around 80 agencies employing private security personnel in the city the number of private security personnel is expected to go up with fast development of the city it is high time some effort is made to streamline it
3502172 when we took ismail to bowring hospital the doctors ignored us so we took him to a private hospital where he was admitted for a day it all happened because ismail drank water directly from the tap without my knowledge
3502173 but this has only added to our problems as the muck has spread all over the road after it rained we are living amidst filth and squalor and are also forced to consume dirty water the officials can spend crores on major projects but hesitate to spend a few lakhs on changing our pipes we are fed up
3502174 most of the water lines are criss crossing sewage lines here some even pass through storm water drains this is because the residents have not bothered to route the water supply lines in a proper manner following the damage of one main water line sewage has entered the entire network resulting in contamination
3502175 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3502176 the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown broken promises
3502177 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3502178 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3502179 we hope it amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
3502180 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3502181 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3502182 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
3502183 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
3502184 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3502185 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3502186 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3502187 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3502188 individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing and limit or avoid outdoor exercise
3502189 this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world
3502190 ive never really been out there as a fully fledged recording artist and performer because of my love for producing and writing now
3502191 helping to provide educational opportunities is definitely one of them
3502192 thanks to the tremendous generosity of our board members supporters and the musicians who participate in this annual fund raiser
3502193 we have been able to increase the number of four year scholarships every year and our goal is to add 20 more students to the program this year
3502194 usually when you finish something you let it sit for a couple of days and then look at it early last week we read through the script and we not only liked the new work we saw how much it needed a new title
3502195 the song bounce is no longer in the show but the tune is
3502196 its slightly amended and it has different lyrics i utilized the tune with some variations and a new lyric
3502197 two divergent aspects of american energy the builder and the squanderer the visionary and the promoter the conformist and the maverick the idealistic planner and the restless cynic the one who uses things and the one who uses them up
3502198 this is closer to what we started with than anything weve done since
3502199 there was always a road image the boys start off with their pioneer father on his death bed telling them to follow the road of their dreams
3502200 in fact there is an actual road in the climax of the show an extraordinary road designed by addison and given wilsons promotional push that would lead into boca raton from the outside world 16 lanes wide this in a day with very few automobiles motorized gondolas palm trees bands
3502201 the whole idea of the road has persisted so when john and i got finished with our final tweaks we realized we needed a title that reflected the journeys of the show
3502202 a lot of people will think im sure that we just cant make up our minds thats why we keep changing titles it is quite the reverse in fact its knowing exactly what we think the show is about and i think a title is to inform an audience if an audience comes to a show called bounce and thats not what its about and theres no song called bounce it seems to me extremely misleading thats why were calling it road show and there wont be a title tune it describes to an audience what theyre going to see it also suggests the loose structure of the piece
3502203 out of sams version id say half the songs are still in the show and a number of songs from this last version
3502204 from this last version from bounce theres one song that has been rewritten for another spot and theres the opening number which has very much the same tune but entirely different lyrics you could call those hold overs otherwise id guess without going through the scorecard there are more songs from the sam mendes but its actually an amalgam of the two as well as a couple of new numbers or actually a couple of ones written before sams version
3502205 im eating a lot of pasta and pizza im eating a lot of carbs and sleeping as much as i can
3502206 i think just about every morning ive woken up at 4 30 or 5 it takes me a while to fall back asleep but i do for about an extra half hour it takes me a while to get up but its the olympics its what you have to do
3502207 i shure am glad that pesterly vermint is outta her lyfe
3502208 this is the best evidence to date that elite suppressors can have fully pathogenic virus
3502209 thats a good sign in terms of developing a therapeutic vaccine
3502210 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3502211 we are trying to figure out exactly how the t cells work in her to inhibit
3502212 we are just trying to see what kind of cytokines they make

3502220 this isnt rejecting cookies outright you are just preferring not to see the ads
3502221 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year
3502222 i just dont have a choice we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee everyones body reacts differently i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3502223 its just letting it heal and doing the rehab and strengthening it more than anything
3502224 hell be able to work on his chipping and putting in pretty short order and i would think hell be able to practice that for a long time
3502225 if hes working out and he has swelling hes got to back off and let it calm down maybe then youve lost a day or a week or 10 days none of this has happened but its a possibility we just dont know the timetable he is on would put him back before augusta but youre really just guessing

3502228 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3502229 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3502230 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3502231 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3502232 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3502233 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3502234 the notes show tojo kept his dyed in the wool militarist mentality until the very end
3502235 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120 percent
3502236 we are now on a course for a humiliating peace or rather a humiliating surrender
3502237 being scared of enemy threats and easily throwing their hands up
3502238 frightened by the new type of bomb and terrified by the soviet unions entry into the war
3502239 many soldiers and the people cannot bring themselves to die until the goal is achieved
3502240 now that the diplomatic steps have been taken after the emperors judgment i have decided to refrain from making any comments about it though i have a separate view
3502241 moral responsibility for causing useless deaths even though they were meant to be sacrifice for a great cause
3502242 i am determined to offer an apology with my death

3502248 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3502249 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3502250 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3502251 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3502252 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world

3502259 es reicht wenn die klagen und erkl rungen unserer b rger an den strafgerichtshof in den haag gesandt werden
3502260 ich will ganz klar machen dass die vereinigten staaten f r die territoriale unverletzlichkeit georgiens und die souver nit t georgiens stehen und dass wir seine demokratisch gew hlte regierung unterst tzen
3502261 sie glauben dass sie einige fortschritte erzielt haben und wir begr en das
3502262 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3502263 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3502264 there is no way federal agencies can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3502265 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects the economy suffers people suffer rational environmental planning suffers some careful streamlining is long overdue
3502266 i have been working on the endangered species act for 15 years and have never seen such a sneaky attack to suggest that our nations most important wildlife law could be gutted after a mere 60 day written comment period is the height of arrogance and disrespect for wildlife science
3502267 this plan repeats and includes all of the disdain for science and political trumping of expertise that has characterized previous bush administration efforts to dismantle fundamental environmental laws these rules send a clear signal that the administration will spend the rest of its days razing what remains of the rules and regulations that have kept wildlife like the bald eagle from going extinct
3502268 these changes clearly threaten to undermine our nations commitment to endangered fish plants and wildlife these changes were written by bush administrations lawyers who have a tragic track record of weakening protections for species most at risk of extinction it is an invitation for federal agencies to ignore the law until caught and to fast track oil and gas mining logging and development without review of the impacts to our nations wildlife fish and plants on the brink of extinction at a time when species are reaching crisis mode due to climate change the bush administration is looking for ways to shirk its responsibility in protecting wildlife
3502269 the insidiousness of self consultation is especially plain once you consider that many federal agencies are deeply committed to either certain kinds of projects the bureau of reclamation likes to build dams the department of transportation likes highways or are entirely sympathetic to particular industries the office of surface mining for example its a clich but todays proposal is as clear a case of letting the fox guard the henhouse as youre ever likely to see

3502286 uc san diego medical center is a baby friendly hospital which means we encourage breastfeeding as the preferred method of infant nutrition for our newborns
3502287 we are now applying this same model of care to our smallest most vulnerable infants the goal is a better understanding of human milk to achieve healthier preemies who are breastfeeding when they leave our hospital
3502288 the baby is in a doubly difficult situation of dealing with life outside the womb while having a highly immature gastrointestinal system this can lead to major bowel dysfunction or failure while this is a critical time to care for infant this is also a pivotal time to help mom make breastfeeding a priority for the long term health of their child
3502289 while premature infants may not be capable of breastfeeding in the short term we are identifying strategies and techniques to provide the infants the milk and to make the milk available in the long run the data collected from this study will be shared globally with hospitals that would like to adopt similar programs for premature infants
3502290 human breast milk is considered human tissue and is full of carbohydrates lipids vitamins and minerals there are approximately 300 components to breast milk including small biologically active compounds that aid in the formation of the gastrointestinal tract
3502291 the contents vary dramatically from mother to mother and feeding to feeding depending on the babys needs
3502292 we plan to look for correlations between the mothers diet and the nutritional characteristics of the breast milk we may be able to identify certain foods and supplements that aid in the infants growth and development
3502293 fortunately breast milk contains enzymes that help protect against nec
3502294 babies born at one pound have their intestinal development in place but all things attributed to function are either at the earliest phase or have not kicked in at all breast milk has growth factors that affect the ability of the gut to grow and can get the digestion process on track to prevent this dangerous infection
3502295 every second counts for the growth rate of infants especially in the first days when babies are gaining up to 20 grams per kilogram of weight per day
3502296 the brain increases 5 in size every 48 to 72 hours adequate and extra nutrients can improve brain growth which is something the spin program is measuring
3502297 human milk provides benefits that are both nutritional and neurological
3502298 in our life time we will not be able to replicate its biological complexities until that day the best thing for all newborns is breast milk the spin program will help us learn how and why for preemies
3502299 would inevitably require judicial intrusion into matters of national security and sensitive intelligence information
3502300 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3502301 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer

3502303 foster wheeler is a worldwide engineering construction and project management contractor with a reputation for delivering high quality reliable facilities
3502304 and while the company does business in 26 countries its contracts in china alone could keep foster wheeler busy for several years
3502305 foster wheeler operates in two segments the global engineering and construction group designs and builds energy processing facilities worldwide
3502306 the company has a dod contract to develop a gasification unit that will be used in 21 coal fired electric plants the systems being produced by foster wheeler emit no airborne pollutants and are cost effective i think the technology has enormous potential
3502307 so do the chinese as you may know china produces almost all its electricity with coal the only fossil fuel it has in abundance most chinese coal fired plants are major polluters and must be cleaned up foster wheeler is the leading contender for the contracts
3502308 the companys coal technology also produces flammable gasses that can be used in other types of power generating equipment including fuel cells and gas turbines
3502309 in addition the gaseous coal is a good feedstock for various industrial chemicals the char waste that is left over after the process is complete can be burned in high pressure steam turbine electric plants
3502310 of course other energy contractors also have coal gasification technology the process dates to the 1930s however foster wheelers synfuel process operates at much lower temperatures than competing methods this reduces the need for expensive gas exchangers and cleanup systems
3502311 they are also easier to scale up or down for different sized plants its not surprising that the chinese decided the foster wheeler system is the best fit for them
3502312 foster wheelers second business is the global power group that constructs electric plants throughout the world chinas contracts alone could keep foster wheeler busy for several years
3502313 foster wheeler also excels in using waste energy from industrial operations to generate power an area where it competes with ormat technologies in addition the company uses many kinds of industrial solids as fuel in power plants
3502314 with todays high energy costs the companys efficient green processes are in great demand

3502321 during the past two three weeks the past month that we have been together i have been very pleased with his performance not only on the pitch but in terms of his relationship with his team mates
3502322 this is what made me decide that he will be staying with us i am convinced that he will perform really well because he is a player with much talent

3502504 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3502505 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3502506 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3502507 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity

3502553 this is how sieg heil got started and no im not saying obama is hitler i just think people should be careful about slipping into a personality cult for a charismatic leader
3502554 our symbol o is about much more than barack obama
3502555 barack obama is a very exciting catalyst at first we were bothered by the negative and vulgar comments made when someone attacks something you hold dear it hurts but as we continued to read all the comments we realized just how silly and frankly unimaginative most of them were many didnt even take the time to read the article people came out against the peace emblem in the sixties making accusations that it was an anti christian symbol an inverted crucifix a satanic symbol and a communist sign but like our o the goodness inherent in the peace symbol persevered and today it is the international symbol for peace the hand sign for peace was first a british form of giving someone the bird then it became a war cry for victory today it is a symbol of peace amp love once again goodness persevered we too will persevere bring your hands together over your head to make a large o and join us in our fight to take america back vote for barack obama

3502583 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3502584 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3502585 he knows about it so its a bit strange he would complain
3502586 hes possibly exaggerating about the four tests but certainly he is part of the program he knows he will be tested more often
3502587 the point is its a good thing if hes been tested a lot
3502588 hes a favorite for the 100 meters so why not
3502589 blood tested once and urine tested once since ive been here
3502590 its what im doing to show my love for my sport
3502591 it comes with the territory past champions have tested positive but an olympic champion needs to carry himself clean to be clean and to be able to prove hes clean

3502595 its a bit more complex than we had thought it was
3502596 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3502597 drug development is the next stage and now we know exactly where out of a great many calls that we need to be aiming these therapies to get the best chance of attacking and killing the cancer
3502598 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3502599 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3502600 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3502601 but in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once
3502602 they would not turn cancerous immediately but once they had been given an instruction to turn into a more specialised cell the mutation would take hold and they would instead turn into a tumour

3502605 we as a party will be carrying out a press conference tomorrow
3502606 its unknowable when a deal will be reached but the president is due back from zimbabwe later today
3502607 since their formation the zimbabwe defence forces have remained steadfast in defending our national sovereignty territorial integrity and interests as well as our hard won independence
3502608 these sterling achievements have overcome numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community to destabilise our peace and stability and thus cause confusion in our country
3502609 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3502610 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3502611 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3502612 we cannot continue with a situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to the problem

3502637 one knows the jewish soul when it reveals itself explicitly glaringly as it does with some people his jewishness was the essence of who he was the connecting thread that ran through his entire life
3502638 i have set before thee life and death the blessing and the curse therefore choose life
3502639 you should have seen his eyes twinkle when he read out loud clich s about the israeli occupiers denounced in pravda headlines

3502641 every time the children had a bike race philip would take off full speed quickly leave others behind and then almost at the finish line slow down stop and calmly look around smiling he had enjoyed the race knew that he could finish first but victory over others did not interest him in the least
3502642 they were real lacking ulterior motives and reflecting who he was from very early age
3502643 not rebelling against authority on principle he did not accept diktat and refused to follow directions blindly if he did not see logic in them
3502644 he would fix fragile objects use threadlike parts and nimbly manipulate minuscule pieces one could see only with a magnifying glass when he was working on a project the resemblance to his grandfather was amazing
3502645 to grandparents from philip three and a half years old
3502646 30 or 40 times as many as i have received during my entire life
3502647 retrospectively it seems as if he were in a hurry to accomplish as much as he could as if he knew how little time he had
3502648 his short life reminds of a vector directed towards a single point
3502649 which in israeli army slang means that he loved his work to the point of obsession
3502650 he simply couldnt afford not to know how to behave in a particular situation
3502651 instilled trust conveying the feeling that a patient is in confident hands
3502652 grandpa took part in three major russian offensives during the second world war each time it was a bloodbath red army soldiers were not spared and one had to be killed not to be counted among the wounded grandpa was wounded three times and survived so dont be afraid
3502653 though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
3502654 i will fear no evil for thou art with me
3502655 a big man in every sense of the word big in size big in his soul big in his gifts and big in his death
3502656 it would take a whole platoon of the angels of death
3502657 his mind should not remain solely his it should belong to the entire nation of israel

3502688 the israeli proposal is not acceptable the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3502689 the whole world must know that ending the conflict requires an end to the israeli occupation of the lands that were occupied in 1967 including east jerusalem we dont distinguish between a settlement that was built today and one that was built 35 years ago

3502733 in a biological context when two rather similar species i e energy transduction mechanisms compete for the same source of energy e g food the one with even slightly more effective mechanisms e g claws teeth feet etc captures more than the other
3502734 gradually the population of the more effective species will increase at the expense of the other
3502735 let us assume that a mutation happens to improve the speed of a cheetah
3502736 consequently this cheetah will catch more food i e more energy will channel through this individual the path has become steeper likewise a deleterious mutation will reduce the flow via the particular path that has turned less steep in this case the non mutated paths are the healthy rivalries and will enjoy correspondingly larger flows due to the diminished competition
3502737 a system evolves to reach a stationary state with respect to its surroundings
3502738 that is to say when the surrounding environment is high in energy then the system will evolve to a high energy stationary state matter on earth has evolved over eons in increasing its energy content to match that of the solar radiation density during this process mechanisms of energy transduction have improved but presumably there are still ways to catch more of the sunlight to power activities that are presently fueled by non renewables
3502739 if you cross the median chances are good that the resulting crash will cause a fatality or incapacitating injury because they usually occur at high speeds
3502740 the studies make it clear that cable barriers are keeping people from crossing the media and they are saving lives
3502741 over a 15 year lifespan of the cables the maintenance costs will be higher but still less expensive overall compared to their concrete counterparts

3502827 there is a job to do here and i am looking forward to it
3502828 there is speculation around the club and that has been prevalent since i joined the club but from my own point of view i am very focused on what i am about and what i aim to achieve here and that means success on the pitch
3502829 nothing whatsoever has changed in that respect and the football operation hasnt changed since i signed for the club nor has my relationship with garry cook and his team we get on really well and continue to speak on a daily basis
3502830 i am the guy that makes the decisions in relation to the football and they make the decisions in relation to the running of the club
3502831 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3502832 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3502833 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years
3502834 were a bit dizzy with it were just getting so many conflicting messages i think most supporters are worried that the impact on the club is going to be very negative
3502835 i dont see a great deal of positives at the moment
3502836 if hes been out shopping he can just take 15 minutes to talk to any representative of the press and give them a story to take back to the fans in manchester

3502873 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3502874 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3502875 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3502876 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3502877 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3502878 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3502879 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side

3502892 in october 2001 odonnell was working at the big distribution center in hamilton township when tainted letters whipping through sorting machines released anthrax spores
3502893 federal investigators have declared the 2001 anthrax attacks a closed matter but four years ago this week they swarmed the southern tier after a supposed suspect in the case fbi agents searched dr kenneth berrys east pearl street home his former apartment and his parents summer home on the new jersey shore he had been training medical professionals to respond to chemical and biological attacks since 1997 he later developed a system to respond to an anthrax attack after letters laced with the deadly substance were circulated to government officials the fbi never issued any charges indeed the agency never commented on any aspect of the investigation of dr berry
3502894 the army scientist suspected in the anthrax attacks was remembered for his humor intelligence and compassion at a memorial service saturday bruce ivins 62 died of an apparent suicide late last month after being informed by the fbi that charges likely were being brought against him in connection with the 2001 attacks some mourners wept when speakers at the service talked about ivins many hobbies including juggling target shooting practical jokes cartoons and the weather colleagues recalled a talented scientist with a probing mind who loved to debate a wide variety of subjects
3502895 utah s dugway proving ground produced one of two strains of anthrax that fbi investigators say was used in the september 2001 poison letter campaign that killed five and injured 17 the federal investigation once again focuses attention on utah s chemical and biological testing facility in tooele countys west desert the utah anthrax strain referred to in the documents as dugway ames spores 1997 or rmr 1029 was one of two that ivins is said to have used to produce a third strain that he mailed to public officials and media outlets the fbi documents suggest that ivins used specialized techniques to cover his tracks once he had obtained the anthrax from dugway while he worked at fort detrick but there is no evidence in the documents showing anything untoward or illegal took place at the utah facility
3502896 the anthrax killer spurred a whole new branch of science that could give the nation a head start in the next emergency whether its investigating more bioterrorism or even a food poisoning outbreak its called microbial forensic a way of using a germs genetics to help exonerate or incriminate much as human dna can today microbes whether bacteria like salmonella and e coli or viruses like hiv have unique genetic signatures that can allow scientists to tell even the most closely related strains apart the forensic side comes from adding crime investigation techniques to this advanced microbiology used by disease detectives if tracing a single vial of germs sounds impressive consider research under way now might one day allow tracing where someone has recently traveled by the dna of bacteria in the dirt on their shoes
3502897 growers lost 250 million this spring and summer when an outbreak of salmonella was originally linked to certain tomatoes in 2006 spinach growers said an outbreak of e coli poisoning cost them 350 million the losses in such cases would be less if regulators required growers processors and retailers to maintain a traceback system with computerized records food poisoning takes a huge toll in the united states about 5 000 deaths a year and 76 million illnesses with 325 000 victims requiring hospitalization
3502898 president bush used the congressional recess to make an unusual request for 1 2 billion in amendments to his 2009 budget proposal including millions for investments in new technology and controversial cuts to environmental and social programs the proposals biggest change is at the health and human services department which would receive an extra 905 million for bioterrorism preparedness the money would help develop an infrastructure for moving medical supplies and protective gear in the event of a bioterrorist attack or pandemic another 35 million in preparedness money would go to the environmental protection agency
3502899 federal prosecutors on friday officially excluded scientist steven j hatfill from involvement in the deadly 2001 anthrax mailings formally closing the door on a costly episode that sidetracked the fbis search for nearly five years u s attorney jeffrey taylor sent a letter friday to a lawyer for hatfill a onetime fort detrick md bioweapons researcher that essentially cleared hatfill of a crime in which he was declared a person of interest six years ago

3502920 its exactly like hungary 1956 its exactly like czechoslovakia 1968 it is like afghanistan invasion it is like nazi germany invasion of czechoslovakia and poland so this is the full scale russian military intervention military aggression on its neighbor
3502921 the full scale military aggression against the country is aimed to destroy country and to overthrow the government of this democratic country on its knees
3502922 the russian aggression continues as we speak and their air force is still bombing civilian and military targets and people are still dying and we think this madness should be stopped
3502923 look into a crystal ball and know what russia was trying to do

3502939 liberalisasi sektor hilir migas membuka kesempatan bagi pemain asing untuk berpartisipasi dalam bisnis eceran migas namun liberalisasi ini berdampak mendongkrak harga bbm yang disubsidi pemerintah sebab kalau harga bbm masih rendah karena disubsidi pemain asing enggan masuk
3502940 ini ironi kita membeli minyak milik kita sendiri di halaman rumah kita dengan harga yang ditentukan oleh asing
3502941 serta memberikan kewenangan kepada perusahaan asing dan domistik untuk melakukan eksplorasi dan eksploitasi minyak
3502942 sedangkan perusahaan independent menguasi cadangan minyak 12 persen dan gas 5 persen
3502943 kita harus menyadari minyak bumi itu bukan dibuat oleh pemerintah
3502944 jadi kalau harga bbm dinaikan maka yang kena dampaknya 80 persen adalah rumah tangga dan industri
3502945 kenapa yang halal hanya subsidi bbm kenapa pembayaran utang luar negeri menjadi tidak halal

3503355 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3503356 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3503357 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3503358 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3503359 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3503360 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3503361 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3503362 in a master metered building you dont know who is wasting water taking 25 minute showers
3503363 we have a 160 unit apartment building which in two hours is going to use the same amount as a single family residence does in one month

3503369 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3503370 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3503371 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3503372 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3503373 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3503374 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3503375 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3503376 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3503377 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3503378 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3503379 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3503380 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3503381 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3503382 we hear everything thats on tv and we hear everything thats out there
3503383 you know what theres two sides to every story hes actually a sweet kid you know what everybody probably hears that about their kids but you know i think the entire situation everybody out here who got a camera or a microphone in my face this time you guys might have this one wrong
3503384 this will keep them shut down as we try to sort out problems and determine if there are any additional problems
3503385 we have struggled for years to find a text that covered the subject matter in a way that we can update it fairly frequently
3503386 the professors shouldnt be choosing a custom textbook just so they can make a few extra dollars
3503387 theres still 43 custom titles out there that who knows if theres royalties being produced
3503388 the textbook for the fall semester and have adopted a series of computer simulation labs instead
3503389 bookstores mission is to reduce the costs for our students
3503390 the cost of textbooks is an issue that is talked about a lot
3503391 faculty are very much aware of the high cost of textbooks
3503392 i can tell you ive had no formal offer by the board nor have i accepted any formal offer by the board
3503393 it depends on how you define inside or outside the district
3503394 kathy was assistant principal out there all the time i was an assistant superintendent and i dont think anyone would say i showed any favoritism toward rock bridge during those years
3503395 when she was appointed principal i was out of the district
3503396 those worried that rock bridge would be favored over hickman should recall that i spent over a third of my career at hickman i have deep ties to hickman that is a concern we can lay to rest it simply would not be a conflict i would not allow it to be nor would kathy
3503397 board members are not engaged as much in some issues maybe think about engaging us a little more
3503398 sometimes i feel disengaged im always willing to do more
3503399 we have to address in a board meeting the discontent with the math curriculum
3503400 we have to address legitimate concerns about the curriculum and it has to be openly addressed
3503401 she has this ability to be there when shes needed anybody that knows trish knows that she had to be there georgia is her emotional home her adopted home when you have skills that can help people shes helping everybody georgian and russian shes a true physician helping in any way that she can figure out

3503411 ps3 might happen in the future whats going to definitely happen this year is a pc release the only reason thats not out right now is because i wanted to focus on one platform at a time
3503412 wiiware is not going to happen for this game braid is too big of a game to be downloaded on wiiware and stored on someones wii

3503414 contractor officials and the dod contracting community improperly influenced the audit scope conclusions and opinions of some audits a serious independence issue
3503415 of course its important to hold the dcaa accountable but the reality is it was still the most independent entity in dod now we have a group of defense industry people advising how to fix the dcaa
3503416 i fear the cure will be much worse than the illness
3503417 googles acquisition of begun is likely to significantly alter the advertising channel allowing google to enhance monetisation of its already significant 35 share of the
3503418 although google does not disclose information about its russian operations industry sources estimate that it had approximately 5 revenue share in 2006 and 2007 implying a search monetisation 4 7 times lower than that of yandex this appears to be caused by googles inability thus far to adjust to peculiarities of the russian payment system i e cash direct money transfer etc rather than cheques as well as the lack of a direct sales force this weakness was the key underpinning and rationale for the begun transaction
3503419 overall rankings for the russian market have changed significantly over the past year with two social networking sites

3503440 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3503441 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3503442 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3503443 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3503444 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning
3503445 but thats just going to put a little more added pressure on doing things right our strong belief is there will be guys who really step up during this time period
3503446 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
3503447 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
3503448 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
3503449 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools

3503451 it became clear that hudgens and her new team all directed by her father would take every possible opportunity to deprive vieira of the benefits to be derived from the settlement agreement

3503453 we have made important progress in the last six months to preserve the long term sustainable profitability of our company while working through a process to ensure fair and equitable consideration for all stakeholders
3503454 since january we successfully signed new agreements with many of our customers whose work was due to be renewed despite a challenging economic environment and the unfavourable perception created by our filing
3503455 the dollar rally has temporarily stalled with players looking to take profit on recent outsized moves
3503456 the market has had a pretty good rally in the last few days it got about 8 percent off the lows so theres possibly some profit taking in the banking sector with the lowering of earnings forecasts for goldman sachs
3503457 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
3503458 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
3503459 to encompass all interactive techniques the touch the speech the vision
3503460 because theyre fairly developed in the labs i can say that in 10 years will be widespread
3503461 you might get artificial intelligence or robotics but those are still so undeveloped at least in terms of widespread impact
3503462 it really is a milestone i think and shows the world this opportunity to all work together and how places like hong kong and china will be such an important part of the future
3503463 whether its software or energy or agriculture the promise of science is much greater than ever before and thats why im so optimistic
3503464 those oracle and sap are the two big software opportunities that we can work on

3503468 we want to offer them transparency and choice about the options that are available to them
3503469 this is in addition to our existing opt out when yahoo serves customized advertising on third party networks
3503470 we believe this is particularly important since it is not always obvious to all users that ads are served by different entities among web sites
3503471 consistent with the terms of the providers existing customer notices and
3503472 additional steps to protect our customers privacy including confirming their interest in receiving tailored advertisements and by securing an additional opt in consent from them
3503473 customers shouldnt be required to read complex and confusing legal updates about privacy policy
3503474 the companies really failed to fully disclose all the data collection and targeting they routinely do
3503475 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3503476 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3503477 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3503478 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3503479 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3503480 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3503481 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3503482 i was going to do that but i didnt know how to do it here as this doesnt have the functionality of say sharepoint hence why a general it survey and besides the commericals on the tv say it salaries of 37 000 without a job title granted its not the indepth sell or consultation

3503509 theres a lot of people that study jefferson davis and in the last few years theres been a lot more interest in his role not just in the war but in his experience before the war
3503510 i think theres a trend that there seems to be people who want to learn more about jefferson davis and what happened to him
3503511 clearly for whatever reason people are finding a reason to visit those lincoln sites and looking at the lincoln legacy in kentucky
3503512 the interest is there and i think its fair to say that there has probably never been as much focus on lincolns kentucky connection as there is now

3503538 treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in post war kosovar adolescents using mind body skills groups a randomized controlled trial
3503539 is important because it provides scientific evidence for the efficacy of a model that has been taught to almost 3 000 health and mental health professionals and educators worldwide weve used this small group model to give tens of thousands of children and adults practical tools that help them to feel better quickly and weve taught them to use their intuition and imagination to solve problems that had seemed overwhelming we help traumatized people around the world to draw on strengths they may have forgotten they have and we offer them a safe place in which they can share their pain with others who have suffered as they have
3503540 this model is educational non stigmatizing and powerfully effective it can be easily taught and can be used by people of all ages on their own
3503541 its highly acceptable to populations which do not want to be given medication those with no access to a doctor or therapist and those who are in psychotherapy

3503558 we have used documents memos other things in the past where complaints have been filed we have used whatever comes to us that does not mean it goes to the rules committee
3503559 i think that it was calculated to have an impact on other delegates and i think this kind of communication does have a very chilling impact on other delegates because people become afraid to speak up they become afraid to say what they think

3503613 we havent been shipping chipsets for intel processors for a while now and are only shipping a limited volume of chipsets for amd chipsets

3503621 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3503622 we did some driver work along with this bridge chip to make this somewhat seamless
3503623 forcing us to download and reinstall the entire program for every little update and bundling quicktime too whether its new or not
3503624 so why does the itunes store still employ digital rights management drm for the majority of songs in its library blaming the record labels no longer holds water amazonmp3 and rhapsody are among a growing number of services selling drm free mp3s from all the major labels not just emi
3503625 apple seems unwilling to acknowledge that people get music from sources other than itunes how else to explain the softwares inability to monitor folders and automatically add new music to the library
3503626 earlier this year apple hopped aboard the crapware train by adding its new for windows safari browser to its software update tool which tends to appear whenever theres a new version of itunes
3503627 if youre going to keep clinging to drm apple how about giving us a music subscription service to go with it you know the kind offered by napster rhapsody and zune marketplace
3503628 itunes is like a strict schoolmarm if you dont listen to your subscribed podcasts on a frequent and regular basis the program stops downloading new episodes
3503629 next to every single item in your library songs tv shows podcasts and so on theres a little check box its been there as long as we can remember but if the itunes help function explains its purpose that entry is really hard to find
3503630 actually its pretty simple unchecked items dont get played when youre listening to your library or a playlist likewise unchecked items dont get synced to your ipod if you enable the sync only checked songs and videos option in the devices summary menu
3503631 come on apple make nice with nbc already swallow your pride and get nbc back on board in time for september
3503632 here we are seven versions into itunes and the player still doesnt have decent dockable controls
3503633 dockable itunes toolbar with volume seek play pause and other controls and an optional song info ticker

3503635 admittedly smallish ipod screens dont lend themselves well to reading on the go but the iphone and ipod touch are perfect for the job
3503636 we were unable to process your most recent payment did you recently change your bank phone number or credit card
3503637 we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
3503638 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction and that this constitutes the very rationale to kill this effort totally we urge you to carefully consider the existing precedent before making your determination
3503639 for consumers the interference will be extensive widespread and unpredictable significantly degrading their service
3503640 in essence theyre gaming the system to make rules so that a new broadband competitor doesnt appear
3503641 any new entrant especially one that appeals to consumers because the price is disruptive is something they want to kill or delay

3503648 markets ended lower on iip data which was above the market expectation but not enthused by the market participants the part of selling was from a section of players who believe that the securities and exchange board of india sebi may introduce stringent key norms for fiis and may not address p notes tomorrow in the light of a long weekend holiday due to the independence day traders were cutting down positions
3503649 no hermione it doesnt work like that i came here for an evening amongst friends and all said friends can think of is asking me stupid questions about my relationship with remus

3503652 pass that on to the others as well would you because im going home now
3503653 remus why dont they understand that were just like everyone else
3503654 im sick of them questioning us sick of it its not that hard to understand or is it they know us why do they have to question our motives and what gives them the right to ask questions they never dared asked when it was me and hermione i fucking hate it
3503655 look remus im sorry okay i shouldnt have yelled at you let alone shoved you i just lost it im sorry
3503656 its okay love dont let them get to you i am sure they meant well

3503663 this new ruling will have significant implications for the growing number of organisations looking to merge or even just share resources to deliver their services more effectively to improve profits
3503664 we currently believe this is more likely a 2010 event rather we believe a smaller version of the 13 inch macbook air is likely in the 2009 timeframe

3503671 when i go into sites i would love to turn them on to the benefits of the testng test framework
3503672 but most organizations do so little unit testing if any that i stick with the simple well known xunit tools so as not to create confusion most organizations are just not ready to learn anything more than basic unit testing if that
3503673 the problem with unit testing is that it increases the cost of development before you know whether what you developed is what you needed afterwards when you have a working solution theres little interest in writing unit tests as what you have works and your management wants you to move on
3503674 many developers and managers mistakenly think that by cutting testing they well get feature x out faster what they dont realize is that you are robbing peter to pay paul

3503683 it is very interesting that georgia has turned to using the google blogger service as a method of communication during such an attack and it has proved to be a sustainable resource governments will need to have strategies in place to prepare for this type of attack
3503684 we are witnessing in this crisis the birth of true operational cyber warfare

3503702 among the most controversy laden issues on the table are two recent devblogs covering important balance changes slated for eves near future
3503703 eve is basically a ongoing symbiotic process the developers need the players and the players need the developers they both get something out of the deal but what this also implies is that eve cannot remain static both player and developer are involved in making this game change and grow and perhaps that means the developer has to make some unpopular decisions for the good of the process as a whole the relationship between player and developer is not one of equals nor is it always at its best when it is entirely amiable

3503792 the chinese government should immediately release ji sizun and anyone else detained by police while trying to exercise their basic rights
3503793 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it
3503794 people or protesters who want to express their personal opinions can go to do so
3503795 nobody should confuse the lack of protesters with a lack of complaints
3503796 the detention and harassment of those who tried to take the government at its word shows the lengths to which the authorities will go to keep people from peacefully expressing their views

3503802 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3503803 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3503804 i think that these are some very good principles in order to resolve the problem which has arisen from this very dramatic situation and these principles can be used by georgia and south ossetia
3503805 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3503806 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3503807 this is the kind of assistance we are receiving now

3503814 did you know china is complicit with the genocide in darfur
3503815 put a cork in it and just enjoy the show
3503816 lomong told a tale of grief endurance redemption and almost unimaginable hardship that captures in human terms every aspect of the darfur tragedy and without lomong saying a single controversial political word he highlighted chinas culpability in cynically supporting the sudanese regime as partner in the vast oil company petrochina
3503817 this might be china how you regard the tortured people of darfur but here is how we regard them we uphold their dignity and we wont remain quiet about it
3503818 bush had said he was reluctant to mix politics with the olympics saying he wanted to show respect for his chinese hosts and to simply enjoy the games as a sports fan
3503819 the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
3503820 we are awash in information about darfur disturbing photos now ubiquitous of torture death and starvation are just the beginning of it there are the regular dispatches of wire service reporters the drumbeat of opinion columns and the images beamed home by television cameras there are more websites maintained by activists and human rights groups than anyone can count and now there is something else too a substantial body of literature academic and popular about western sudan

3503843 cities use 75 percent of global energy and are responsible for 80 percent of emissions we may be the problem but were also the solution
3503844 surface transport is 22 percent of emissions but buildings represent 70 percent well get half from energy efficiency a quarter from greening the grid electricity produced from wind power and other renewable sources and a quarter from locally produced energy supply thermal decentralized energy combined heat and cooling co generation its going to be nothing short of an energy revolution

3503872 since their formation the zimbabwe defence forces have remained steadfast in defending our national sovereignty territorial integrity and interests as well as our hard won independence

3503881 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3503882 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3503883 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
3503884 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting

3503890 as they approached they saw these guys and identified themselves as law enforcement
3503891 then one of the suspects who was holding a long gun turned toward the deputies as he turned he began to raise up his arm with the gun and two of the deputies opened fire
3503892 several bothersome headlines related to major financial firms have tempered some of the bullish enthusiasm

3503897 there are a whole lot of steps to getting a revitalized village
3503898 its definitely been very successful because it steers us in the right direction
3503899 in my neighborhood almost half of the homes that didnt have children have children now its a completely different place
3503900 there are ways to find this information we need to try because we dont know what were doing until we know this information
3503901 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3503902 there then will be international efforts to facilitate the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict
3503903 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3503904 we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3503905 i was at the olympic training center in colorado springs and glenn eller was in houston shooting by himself
3503906 all of us are now shooting together in the marksmanship unit with great competition day in and out among us and its just improved all of our games
3503907 the hardest part of this olympic experience is waiting for the day to get here
3503908 i wanted to compete at the highest level of clay target shooting to do that i had to commit myself to the sport the u s army and the usamu have given me the necessary resources to compete and win at the level required to win an olympic medal
3503909 the olympics were greater in every aspect than i had anticipated both in highs and lows the emotions involved are so great because of the years of training that go into that one day of competition
3503910 abuse of young girls and in some cases boys by at least 100 indian peacekeepers over a period of several years
3503911 reiterates in the strongest possible terms that such behaviour if substantiated is wholly unacceptable
3503912 should be taken as soon as possible against those found to be involved in such misconduct
3503913 that the allegations will be promptly and thoroughly investigated and if proven strict and exemplary action would be taken as per the law
3503914 highly values indias long standing and valuable support for united nations peacekeeping
3503915 his respect for all those peacekeepers from india and other troop contributing countries who serve with honour and commitment
3503916 the misconduct of a few should not diminish the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the large number of blue helmets who serve the cause of peace
3503917 as they approached they saw these guys and identified themselves as law enforcement

3503920 paving the road home the national behavioral health conference and policy academy on returning veterans and their families
3503921 this conference and policy academy is really designed overall to help states and territories and the district of columbia think about new approaches particularly approaches that blend expertise and resources from multiple contributors
3503922 its going to provide framework to consider different approaches dialogue with colleagues and work toward a unified plan that they can take to their states to ensure that veterans have the mental health services they need and want
3503923 whether were from the federal government whether from state or local government the research community or wherever you come from today look for ways that we can address the needs that those men and women return with
3503924 whether were from samhsa or the va or dod we each have a role to play in addressing those needs
3503925 weve come up with a center of centers concept because weve realized that none of us have all of the answers
3503926 we brought in four existing centers that have been doing great work for a long time
3503927 thats why i personally appreciate the expertise and counsel as you formulate better mental care policies particularly to reduce stigma
3503928 stigma is a huge component in the inability for servicemembers to effectively seek support and care
3503929 it doesnt matter how good your opportunities are how effective your integration of community and military and veterans affairs programs are if you dont open the door for participation in a way that men and women will walk through its not going to work
3503930 its definitely been very successful because it steers us in the right direction
3503931 in my neighborhood almost half of the homes that didnt have children have children now its a completely different place
3503932 there are ways to find this information we need to try because we dont know what were doing until we know this information
3503933 for only the third time in 72 years berlin 1936 moscow 1980 the games are being hosted by a tyrannical regime the mind of which was displayed in the opening ceremony featuring thousands of drummers each face contorted with the same grotesquely frozen grin
3503934 it was a tableau of the miniaturization of the individual and the subordination of individuality to the collective
3503935 listen strange women lying in ponds and handing out swords is no basis for a system of government
3503936 i am sure you will be fine but i will go with you anyway
3503937 san franciscos dont ask dont tell sanctuary policies protect illegal alien gang bangers and put american citizens at risk

3503940 worth fighting for was written to serve as a reminder that no matter where our military is at the moment they are forever in our hearts and we will forever be grateful for the sacrifices they make daily
3503941 our liberty is of high value and we are so thankful for the dedicated soldiers who have served us in the past and the soldiers that are presently serving our beautiful country
3503942 when our military prepares to leave the united states they are given the tools to be stronger but it is equally important to remain healthy in the mind as it is in body
3503943 this book is to be a reminder to keep fighting for what we all believe in and to never take their eye off the end result i hope this book supports all of their hopes and dreams and brings them home safely to their beloved friends and family
3503944 as he gets more comfortable in the system he starts to settle and get in a groove he was third string but he kept pushing and pushing staying ready five weeks into the season he was our starter
3503945 on tuesdays last season we were getting after the scout team pretty good
3503946 he can move the pocket hes good enough to flick the ball around and find guys any time you have a quarterback who can move it around thats a problem for you as a defense
3503947 its hard because his instincts are to go out be a playmaker like going out on a fastbreak rather running set offense
3503948 he has to get his eyes down the field his eyes are still too much looking at the blocking i think craft is further along in that regard
3503949 until i come up with an idea that cant tell its asshole from its elbow sometimes it seems like these critics dig and dig and dig until they find a single phrase that they can convolute and invert so that it finally fits their asinine theory
3503950 when do we bring you into a project and why
3503951 why do you make a sitemap instead of the technology team
3503952 why do you suddenly get to tell me what to design if im a designer and youre not
3503953 i think all supermodels now are losing out to celebrities its celebrities who are getting the cosmetics contracts
3503954 we had this relationship before mtv so there was a place of can we put this behind us i believe in who you are do you still believe in who i am we have something bigger than the show
3503955 businesswise it was definitely in my best interest to take the challenge to move forward and put it behind me
3503956 i said no chairs and no entourage there were no chairs except the ones we were sitting on and there was no entourage
3503957 her chin was almost entirely cut off she had a huge gash in her arm that looked like a really deep wound that was bleeding profusely
3503958 there wasnt a period in my life like serena went through where i was doing drugs and having sex with my best friends boyfriend i never went through that kind of crazy
3503959 ive kissed just three people in my life other than stuff that ive done for tv or movies
3503960 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3503961 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3503962 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3503963 it wasnt like its some mysterious story about some unfinished album that was in some closet for 10 years we finished the album the best that we could when i was 16 we had all the intentions in the world to get it out there and get a record deal with it
3503964 when nothing happened the recordings kind of just disappeared and about two years ago dave my producer and girlfriend drea de matteo both were like youve got to do something with that
3503965 thank you to modern technology it doesnt sound like we dug up some vocals that had always been there and we had to do magic to make it sound new its all about bringing my musical side of everything i do around him and creating this completely different but acceptable space that he fits in
3503966 its been a great day for team columbia and a really special day for linus gerdemann
3503967 the tour de lain isnt a major stage race but there are some strong teams here and lots of riders who rode the tour de france we came with a motivated and on form team and the riders proved it with how they dominated things tony was great rabon did really well and im really happy for linus
3503968 his crash in tirreno adriatico could have ended his career but hes worked hard and made a fantastic recovery winning has really boosted his moral and motivated him for the tour of germany at the end of the month
3503969 its an up and down stage and so it wont be easy to control things
3503970 will help avoid misuse of the esa to regulate climate change
3503971 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3503972 that any new emissions that are permitted whether from a new highway or anything like that should require consultation with independent scientists because they affect polar bears no science cannot show a direct causal link between emissions 2 000 miles or 5 000 miles away
3503973 a federal agency cannot be required to hold consultations because those emissions could affect climate change
3503974 things wed ask mccain if he ever held a press conference ever again
3503975 forgetting the fact that the russians are in danger of reigniting another war in europe and at the very least restarting the cold war do you still support the diamondbacks trading for dunn despite the fact that he plays terrible defense can never bring the runner from home with a sacrifice fly and is just as likely to strike out each time at the plate as he is to hit a home run further senator should the d backs sign him at the end of the year
3503976 its amazing that this has been kept under wraps for so long considering youre up against the electronic media but it looks as if the film bosses have won a major battle in keeping cruise on camera a top secret this time
3503977 i am no longer in that relationship a lot of you keep asking me why my profile says single and why i seem sad lately so before you read it in some dumb article or online let me be the first to say it we broke up about 2 weeks ago
3503978 we are still friends we are just trying to give each other some space i will always love him this is a hard time for both of us
3503979 i thought being alone again was going to suck i think that is what kept me from breaking up a lot sooner
3503980 i am finding a new sense of freedom and empowerment it sounds corny but i feel like i can do anything i dont need to have someone in my life to make me feel complete
3503981 im not sure how we top britney opening the show

3503987 i had no say in this marketing campaign but if i did things would be different since it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in

3503989 its no secret that im more rugged facially due to a drunken visit by the teen acne fairy but according to this poster ive got perfect porcelain flesh i look like the f kin bathroom floor at caesars palace
3503990 alec baldwin is so f king funny in this movie is he on the poster

3504008 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3504009 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3504010 theyll continue to pop up because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3504011 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here

3504020 it is essential to teenagers academic progress that they continue to read for pleasure outside school
3504021 reading should be fun and something children choose to do in their free time otherwise they will struggle when they move on to tackling more technically demanding texts in secondary schools
3504022 parents have a vital role to play reading and talking about stories together as children move towards secondary school and encouraging them to read everything from novels to magazines as they get older
3504023 the drop in reading standards is very alarming too many children who make the grade at 11 arent achieving the expected level when they turn 14 primary school leavers are being let down in the first three years of secondary school

3504115 precipitou um evento horrorosamente tr gico que impactou a vida de muitos indiv duos
3504116 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
3504117 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
3504118 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
3504119 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
3504120 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
3504121 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
3504122 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
3504123 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
3504124 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me

3504143 when people finally told 9 11 jokes i mean what a relief
3504144 and holocaust jokes sometimes its the only way to provide relief in a sort of therapeutic way
3504145 im hoping that there might be a harmony between the values of humour and morality
3504146 but i feel certain this isnt the case i think there are probably deeply immoral jokes that are very funny

3504161 comienza a manifestarse la madurez cuando sentimos que nuestra preocupaci n es mayor por los dem s que por nosotros mismos
3504162 esa persona debe ser capaz de sobreponer sus propios intereses en favor de un bien com n o de un orden social
3504163 el nivel de madurez queda establecido por la capacidad de autonom a frente a los actos propios
3504164 en el momento que asumo que una determinada conducta acarrea una respuesta del medio favorable o desfavorable para m y los otros y soy capaz de asumir esa elecci n mi acto es un acto maduro
3504165 en este sentido mi actuar de manera madura no est determinado por el hecho de no cometer errores sino en asumirlos no es m s maduro quien no erra en sus actos sino quien los asume
3504166 muchas veces al adulto que tiene muchos conflictos o se mete en problemas decimos que es inmaduro lo que constituye un error ya que ser a poco asertivo o impulsivo act a y luego piensa pero no puede decirse que sea inmaduro porque en la elecci n de su actuar l eligi
3504167 este se alcanza cuando poco a poco dejo de responsabilizar a los otros de mis errores y cuando logro la autonom a en mi actuar es cuando asumo que tanto lo bueno como lo malo que me sucede en definitiva depende de las elecciones que realizo en mi diario actuar

3504190 thats my robe my couch and my private time to enjoy will and grace on tivo
3504191 also thursdays wesley kicks me out of his apartment to commune with the dead and the dead apparently dont like to commune when im listening in the living room actually the dead are just really really loud when theyre getting communed its all oh god oh god oh wesley oh god and thats kind of distracting to the viewing process
3504192 and the award for images i did not need in my head goes to
3504193 well you see my dilemma then until i get my own apartment i have nowhere to go on nights wesley decides to commune with the dead four times in a row while listening to pink floyd really loud and you like all the same shows i do on thursdays and your bathrobe looked so cozy plus look i brought pirate booty
3504194 i like north hollywood 818 unfortunately but at least its not sigh van nuys what fred was thinking when she got that place i do not know but its her morning to waste in traffic not mine
3504195 were i fred id be looking for housing on the west side but thats just me
3504196 freds her own person who can make her own choices anyway lets watch will and grace and not be gossipy because weve already fulfilled every other gay stereotype known to human and demonkind all we need is to be listening to cher while drinking white wine spritzers and the queer o meter would go tilt tilt tilt
3504197 the way i always heard it we need to be listening to madonna and our drinks need to have little umbrellas possibly it could be a musical but i find telling people i like madonna is all the coming out i need to do except to angel whose gaydar is as non existent as george michaels career
3504198 because the month of wesley drooling ive done didnt make that perfectly obvious
3504199 yes except for the part where he once knitted his own sweaters and is basically a complete poindexter made over via angelcakes and evil miss thing
3504200 i remember back when wesley wore glasses and couldnt tell you who chow yun fat was and was also crushing on angel because baby if youre going to go for cruising dark and mysterious man go for the original go for angel
3504201 i saw this armani suit the other day that would so define his pecs
3504202 honey ive been trying to suggest to angel for three years that he needed to dress better sadly this isnt queer eye for the straight vampire so no dice or color
3504203 nobody has any fashion sense at the office except succubitch and shes like unto karen
3504204 except dead and more evil and less prone to saying fun stuff like oh honey or doing anything endearing
3504205 but she is rich evil fashionable and a complete whore
3504206 can we get more drinks before watching the show because this was an exquisite margarita
3504207 ill make us a pitcher and well homo out on the couch and watch will and grace
3504208 itll be fun or if not cant be worse than the meeting this morning my god did you see what angel was wearing
3504209 and those demons who dressed them fredo corleone plus the agony of the muffins we really need to fire our caterer
3504210 i think they were both non fat and sugar free
3504211 so andykins you think will and jack are going to get together
3504212 i think that its all just a tease but i guess well see
3504213 not a bad plan faith really is the only person mad enough to take on angelus and even have a shot at winning and it wouldnt be cricket to make buffy come down and solve your problems would it
3504214 get someone whos compelled to go after what she wants most in a destructive way guess that means she wanted you pretty bad cowboy then again i cant say i blame her though back then werent you one hell of a candy ass
3504215 are you going to go on like this the entire trip
3504216 yes faith and i have numerous issues to work out which i dont need you to catalogue for me as i already know them
3504217 so have you ever told anyone about how hot it made you when she made with the bad touch angel maybe or would they be too scandalized
3504218 in light of recent revelations i suppose no one would be surprised
3504219 after all i have a taste for the curvy brunettes with deep and abiding evil inside
3504220 ever wonder why the bad girls want to fuck you until you scream wes
3504221 in that way you can only know a vamp when hes sunk his fangs into you
3504222 and what about you when you let angel bite you
3504223 i think faith could use a little comfort she got worked over pretty bad and youre going to need her to trust you to pull this off wes
3504224 tell her what touching real darkness really means you know you want to how you touched real darkness two three four times a night and she kept wanting you to touch her again like that ohhhh like that its more entertaining than hearing about the boy she flayed before trying to end the world which is so very angel of her
3504225 it was as if i couldnt wesley are you listening to me
3504226 if thats what you want to do shut me up and ruin your life just because youve decided your break with reality has made you unfit to keep fighting then thats your choice but if i were you id listen to skip and keep an open mind
3504227 huh you dont look like angel less caveman slope to your brow
3504228 nothings hotter than a man who knows when and how to shoot his gun
3504229 oh god you should have known she was evil when she made grown men shop at abercrombie though it brings new meaning to the phrase abercrombie zombie
3504230 why does it trouble you why does she still trouble you
3504231 but i wonder where shes gone id gotten accustomed to her being around you see none of the others could see her but i knew she was there mostly because lilah never shuts up
3504232 you dont need voices in your head to keep you company any more wesley
3504233 youre part of me we all are and my love is enough to keep nasty little voices from destroying your sanity i love you very much wesley more than she ever could
3504234 if she speaks to you again you will tell me right well work through it together
3504235 no this isnt what i want its never what i wanted lilah
3504236 i love him and you dont get to have him
3504237 i dont think its a coincidence that your dream woman is named lilah maybe you knew that lawyer the dead one
3504238 of course you do you doubt everything unless angel tells you so
3504239 willow says the next time shes down shell try to communicate with her find out why she wont leave us alone because willow can do these things
3504240 im nineteen years old and i know what i want
3504241 god wesley youre always so far away from me now
3504242 you were in love and you got lost like in the fairytales
3504243 and when i find my way out of the dark forest youll be waiting for me is that it
3504244 im stubborn like all summers women and i love you
3504245 im not what you need miss summers youre looking for a potential ally secretly longing to be good thats not what i am
3504246 it couldnt have been angel actually it sounds more like lorne but now im curious what did angel say about me miss summers im sure it was entertaining
3504247 you might see him with big schmoopy love eyes but even youve got to know angels profoundly literal like a big blunt instrument to the head
3504248 i dont get your deal youre dead right and you went to hell
3504249 its the hell office of wolfram and hart which is slightly different than the pit itself fewer burning lakes of fire and medieval torture devices more ironic punishments and subtle torments think the episode of the simpsons where they kept feeding homer donuts
3504250 after all you were big with the sinning and small with the remorse im sure youve got all sorts of ironic punishments going on
3504251 they send earnest little goody goodies to entreat me for help in their idiotic schemes without even mentioning how the love of my life is doing
3504252 you dont mind if i smoke do you its not like its going to kill me
3504253 so are you going to help or not wes thinks it might be a way to appeal your contract and get free
3504254 maybe i dont want to be rescued from my contract have you or my ex boyfriend thought of that i dont need saving i dont want to be saved
3504255 that one that one can get you whatever you want if youre willing to pay her price
3504256 name your price i need what you can give me and im willing to pay
3504257 i thought you were a stern unbending champion of good
3504258 ive got ten twelve years on you and i have felt things you will never feel like the mortal terror that sets in when a champion who has already locked you in a wine cellar to die with his favorite insane vampire children threatens to rape you and make you beg dont talk to me about hypocrisy buffy ive walked through hell in high heels and a smile and you cant even read the map
3504259 but what i dont need the pep talk from you i got it from cordelia before she went evil and slammed a big knife into my throat youll pay the price no matter what it is
3504260 and i suppose then you want me to fuck you
3504261 if i wanted you to fuck me id tell you so i have a theory i need you to kiss me to prove it thats all
3504262 also you think angel is the height of love muffin so lets just agree to disagree on what makes a man worth the time of day
3504263 wesley looks good for wes hes shaving again his clothes are less dorky than when i last saw him hes still too skinny and stuff but hes not dating anyone that girl naomi the one from marketing she couldnt deal with his massive you thing and he continues to have a big old fashioned pining for evil dead girlfriend thing like when angel went off on his lilahs the devil and we shouldnt trust her thing he totally dissociated from the convo and then he had to leave hes still massively in love with you and not dealing is that what you wanted to know
3504264 hmmf maybe hell find someone better though i doubt it could you tell him that well dont tell him anything just tell him im keeping up on him
3504265 wow you two really have the big doomed love going huh
3504266 i wonder if he knows how much you love him
3504267 thats the tragedy of it little girl we figured out just how much we love each other after we couldnt do a damn thing to change the fact
3504268 faith warned me about you you know told me how you operate speaking of is there anyone i know who you havent tried to bang
3504269 you know i did have a chance to run away with drusilla and live forever but somehow the idea of spending eternity with a raving loony not my idea of romantic
3504270 do the other goody goodies know youre a bona fide necrophiliac
3504271 very interesting you like it cold and hard which i can respect but its still fascinating how many heroes like it dirty
3504272 i told you i just wanted a kiss that was plenty you can go now
3504273 well i do like slayer but im not in the mood for resentful amateur hour
3504274 you really can go my secretary will make all the arrangements for both sides
3504275 there are plenty of vampires who want to take advantage of that kink of yours miss summers and im not interested in playing your game
3504276 now i really am quite busy so ill just show you out and you can run back and tell everyone how very helpful i was my people will be in contact
3504277 just keep in mind the next time you ask itll cost more
3504278 and what makes you think id bother coming back here
3504279 why for the chance to help an unrepentant sinner see the light while selling out her evil evil coworkers
3504280 thats the good and plentys for you always willing to suffer in the name of someone elses salvation

3504289 it became clear that hudgens and her new team all directed by her father would take every possible opportunity to deprive vieira of the benefits to be derived from the settlement agreement

3504295 we definitely see hactivism taking place from people who have a political ideology and jump on the bandwagon with bots to help promote their opinions and viewpoints whether that be for war or against war or for or against certain countries
3504296 this appears to be more of an intelligence gathering effort rather than a distributed denial of service attack
3504297 the lightweight attacks that took place well over a month prior to this incident indicates other actors with motives different than hactivism are likely involved by the incident
3504298 it appears that someone was sizing up what the resources and capabilities of servers of interest were
3504299 when these attacks first took place before the hactivism jumped on the bandwagon who was behind that and who organized those attacks
3504300 the sequence of events tends to force you to acknowledge that there are likely other actors and other motives involved other than just the reactive hactivism weve seen online
3504301 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3504302 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3504303 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3504304 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3504305 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3504306 she came up to me and she called me an angel
3504307 she gave me this look up and down and said i guess you want me to apologize but it wont be sincere

3504350 the house is in a good condition and has no structural damage it can be restored one reason its wooded staircase and floor were not plundered is it has been under bulbul lalitakala academy
3504351 the house and the land is now under the threat of being occupied by some people who were expelled from the academy due to misappropriation of around tk 55 lakh from 2004 to 2006
3504352 the corruption came to light after an audit done by the deputy commissioners office following the audit we had to take action and expel two members
3504353 the expelled members are now trying to gobble up the land with the assistance of local influential people they have a plan to demolish the house and build a super market with apartment building at this place but if it happens the peace and tranquility of the academy will be gone forever and we will lose the nice old place
3504354 this is not only the building of the academy but also a part of the heritage of this country it will be a misfortune if the house cannot be saved
3504355 then we will be assured of at least the safety of this place an executive order from the government can also save the house
3504356 we have applied to the land reform board for a lease if we can have the lease then we will be able to put up a signboard declaring the lease and that will help us a lot to ward off the land grabbers
3504357 we are trying to buy the land for the academy but the other party is trying to take hold of the land
3504358 we have received an application and it is being examined if there is no legal objection we will give them the lease

3504371 suntem intr adevar interesati de aceasta firma negocieri preliminarii legate de aceasta chestiune sunt in plina desfasurare siveco este o companie buna astfel incat o posibila tranzactie ar consolida pozitia detinuta in regiune iar asseco southern europe este deja o firma puternica pregatita sa intre pe bursa

3504373 siveco este prin performantele si potentialul sau de crestere cea mai atractiva companie de software de pe piata aceasta pozitie explica dorinta multor companii mari de a stabili parteneriate si numeroasele oferte pe care actionarii companiei le primesc
3504374 merita sa platesti pentru o pozitie intr un stat care a intrat de curand in uniunea europeana si care trebuie sa investeasca in noi tehnologii
3504375 din analizele realizate de pierre audoin consultants pac precum si din experienta noastra in fuziuni si achizitii in europa de est asseco este un potential cumparator pentru siveco romania privind tipul de companii in care asseco actionand mai mult ca un investitor financiar decat ca unul strategic a achizitionat actiuni si pe care le controleaza observam un apetit deosebit pentru companiile cu rata mare a profitabilitatii precum si cu un volum de afaceri care sa indreptateasca o listare la bursa
3504376 este adevarat ca anul 2008 nu este cel mai potrivit pentru astfel de operatiuni ipo insa nou creata entitate asseco south eastern europe isi poate pregati prin 1 2 achizitii majore suplimentare pentru a atinge o masa critica structura necesara unei potentiale listari in viitor siveco este o companie cu prestanta in romania are multe din atuurile pe care asseco le vizeaza si cred ca ar aduce un plus important de vizibilitate grupului in romania

3504378 pentru dezvoltatorii care se gandesc insa acum la inceperea unor noi proiecte imobiliare sub noile conditii de creditare este posibil ca bancile sa nu si mai asume riscul investirii mai ales daca proiectele sunt de mari dimensiuni astfel dezvoltatorii se gasesc in situatia de a reinvesti o parte semnificativa din profiturile realizate din proiectele anterioare devenind astfel proprii lor finantatori

3504394 pretul la gaze a urcat dramatic pentru noi pretul la import s a majorat de la 425 427 dolari in trimestrul al doilea la 512 dolari in prezent la fel si pretul la energia electrica
3504395 pana la 1 august avem acel discount de 40 de dolari la gaze si am cerut sa se extinda pana la sfarsitul anului in conditiile in care noi am mentinut pe piata interna un pret mai scazut la ingrasaminte decat cel de afara totodata consumul de ingrasaminte din romania s a dublat in primul semestru comparativ cu semestrul i din 2007 fapt confirmat de ministrul agriculturii iar statul beneficiaza oricum de pe urma acestui lucru
3504396 in trimestrul al doilea am avut productia oprita cam doua saptamani ca urmare a unor probleme la instalatii dar mai ales a unei defectiuni la sistemul de alimentare cu energie electrica al transelectrica noile capacitati de electricitate ne vor feri pe viitor de astfel de intreruperi la energie si vor reduce costurile specifice pentru productia de ingrasaminte
3504397 rezultatele obtinute pe pietele externe reflecta situatia economica existenta in aceasta perioada la nivel international peste jumatate din aparatele frigorifice produse la gaesti merg la export iar criza economica manifestata la nivel mondial a influentat negativ majoritatea statelor in care noi exportam produse
3504398 strategia noastra de extindere a exporturilor ia in calcul piete care ofera o stabilitate cat mai mare din punct de vedere economic

3504400 cifra de afaceri a maserati in romania va atinge la finele acestei luni un nivel de peste 2 6 mil euro valoare aferenta celor 25 de automobile livrate
3504401 given the 25 30 constant annual increase in turnover its holding the top position on the book market in the past 3 years the offer of around 1 200 titles and a portfolio that includes romanian and international authors such as saramago nabokov hemingway lessing fowels rushdie salinger and others the annual profit rate revolving around 15 20 editura polirom can be estimated to be worth over 20m euros probably around 25 million euros
3504402 we hold 8 bookstores that operate via a franchise under the polirom brand in constanta sinaia satu mare zalau slatina bistrita and we have our own bookstore in bucharest at the same time the publishing house collaborates with around 350 bookstores and wholesale distributors across romania and in the republic of moldova and more recently with bookstores in italy and spain as well

3504408 conflictul este rezultatul fricii rusiei de o extindere spre est a granitelor nato fapt perceput drept o amenintare directa la integritatea teritoriului sau
3504409 este clar ca rusia a instrumentat acest conflict si a provocat georgia pentru a ataca osetia de sud
3504410 normal ca unii membri ai nato isi vor pune intrebarea daca asa cum a reactionat georgia trebuie sa actionezi in circumstante tensionate
3504411 conflictul poate fi vazut si din perspectiva bipolarizarii mondiale este o prima confruntare in razboiul pentru suprematie globala in care sua ca principale sustinatoare ale regimului saakasvili au pierdut
3504412 sua nu pot sari acum in ajutorul georgiei si sa atace trupele ruse care sustin ca se afla intr o misiune de mentinere a pacii acest argument rusesc reprezinta un mod ocult de a ascunde intentiile negative in zona
3504413 georgia are foarte putine sanse in acest moment sa mai recupereze teritoriile osetiei de sud si ale abhaziei
3504414 presedintele saakasvili a castigat alegerile promitand ca va recupera teritoriile abhaziei si a osetiei de sud dar sa stabilesti asta fara a te intelege cu rusii este o utopie
3504415 rusia militara are un complex in ziua de azi ca nu mai este cea mai mare putere militara din lume si incearca sa reafirme asta aceasta operatiune atacarea unui teritoriu de catre rusia n n este prima de acest fel de dupa anul 1990 rusia avand de a face numai cu conflicte in interiorul teritoriului sau

3504469 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3504470 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3504471 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3504472 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3504473 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3504474 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3504475 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3504476 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3504477 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3504478 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3504479 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3504480 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3504481 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3504482 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3504483 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3504484 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3504485 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3504486 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

3504491 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3504492 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3504493 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3504494 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3504495 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3504496 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3504497 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3504498 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

3504500 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3504501 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

3504532 as an oil company it is impossible not to derive a higher turnover considering oil prices stood at 59 7 dollars per barrel in h1 2007 and this year the average price climbed to 102 9 dollars operating income generated during this period stood at 34 7 million dollars 22 5m euros 2 5 million dollars lower than our initial estimates and down 17 against the corresponding period of last year in the first six months of this year we posted net income worth 11 9 million dollars 7 7m euros down 33 against the same period last year rising prices at the pump have a positive impact on turnover but procurement expenses are going up and have a negative impact over net income
3504533 denominated in total volumes sales in tonnes stood at the level of 98 of what we registered in the same period of last year nevertheless we managed at the level of sales through filling stations to generate a 4 increase overall we sold around 700 000 tonnes of fuel

3504538 what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like
3504539 everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content
3504540 i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love
3504541 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3504542 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3504543 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3504544 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3504545 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3504546 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3504547 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3504548 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3504549 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3504550 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3504551 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3504552 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3504553 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3504554 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3504555 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3504556 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3504557 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3504558 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3504559 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3504560 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3504566 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3504567 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3504568 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3504569 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3504570 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3504571 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3504572 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3504573 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3504574 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3504575 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3504576 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3504577 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3504578 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3504579 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3504580 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3504581 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3504582 who are open to doing something on the production side
3504583 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3504584 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3504585 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3504586 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3504587 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3504588 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3504589 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3504590 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3504591 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3504592 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3504593 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3504594 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3504595 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3504596 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3504597 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3504598 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3504599 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3504600 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3504601 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3504602 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3504603 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3504604 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3504605 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3504606 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3504607 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3504608 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3504609 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3504610 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3504611 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3504612 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3504613 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3504614 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3504615 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3504616 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3504617 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3504618 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3504619 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3504620 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3504621 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3504622 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3504623 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3504624 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3504625 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3504626 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3504627 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3504628 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3504629 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3504630 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

3504723 really needs to eliminate many of the breeding grounds for extremism which is poverty which is hiv aids which is all of these terrible conditions that make people totally dissatisfied and then look to extremism particularly islamic extremism
3504724 the united states should launch a major program designed not to increase handouts but rather to build capacity improve education cut red tape and reduce the corruption that is the foremost impediment to economic growth
3504725 a comprehensive strategy to promote the reduction of global poverty the elimination of extreme global poverty and reducing by one half the proportion of people worldwide who live on less than 1 per day
3504726 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
3504727 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
3504728 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
3504729 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
3504730 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
3504731 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
3504732 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
3504733 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
3504734 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
3504735 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
3504736 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
3504737 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
3504738 the first principle of prayer is to be yourself prayer is being yourself before god this may sound obvious but it bears a little developing how do you learn to talk with or be with another human being do you begin completely ignorant and have to learn every step of a proper procedure or are the instincts and inclinations already in place so that you can begin easily enough and grow in facility through experience a lot of prayer is defeated by pseudo ideals one ready way to misconceive it is to think of it as making something beautiful for god you will think good and holy thoughts you will have warm and loving feelings you seek a religious experience you have no religious experience instead god seems distant and disinterested and you struggle to make contact felling alone and rejected the problem is not really personal failure but pseudo ideals prayer is not making something beautiful for god or having god make something beautiful for you or getting into a separate space where your life cannot touch you all the living models of prayer we have considered show us that prayer is rather being yourself before god coming as you are not putting on a face and manufacturing appropriate thoughts and feelings but being yourself and working with the thoughts and feelings that are there
3504739 you have duped me o lord and i let myself be duped
3504740 postures are concerned not really with any kind of physiological training but an inner training of being learning just to be
3504741 the true contemplative is not one who prepares his mind for a particular message that he wants or expects to hear but is one who remains empty because he knows that he can never expect to anticipate the words that will transform his darkness into light
3504742 there have been claims in the past that have been made against our card or other cards and happily theyve all been able to be dismissed or dealt with

3504755 we are not continuing to play until someone picks her up and makes sure she is alright
3504756 im afraid i might not be able to make the jump this year this game is crazy
3504757 i think this means anyone can play against each other and the game wont be a blow out

3504759 the force unleashed does not support the trophy system on ps3 i cant speculate about what might happen in the future though
3504760 that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
3504761 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was

3504765 hey aspiring child actors competing for our hearts and votes on a competitive talent show what could go wrong
3504766 do you want to take advice from the man who looked at the
3504767 in mod cert o iesire din capitalul time warner in active generatoare de venituri ar fi atractiva dar la ora actuala nu au fost propuse ca sa putem lua o decizie in acest sens
3504768 totusi am dori incercam si sa mentinem relatia cu jeff si oamenii time warner in cazul in care tranzactia ar putea fi posibila
3504769 aceasta prima forma de protest presupune purtarea unor insemne specifice menite sa reflecte starea de nemultumire a salariatilor fata de tot ceea ce se intampla la nivelul bcr fata de modalitatea in care patronatul intelege sa respecte drepturile legale ale acestora si fata de modul in care intelege bcr sa asigure un parteneriat cu salariatii reprezentati prin organizatia sindicala reprezentativa
3504770 au fost luate masuri astfel incat activitatea la nivelul unitatilor teritoriale sa nu fie afectata relatia cu clientii bancii sau programul de lucru sa nu fie perturbat acestia urmand sa beneficieze pe tot parcursul desfasurarii formei de protest de toate serviciile oferite de bcr ca intr o zi normala de lucru
3504771 programul nu poate asigura respectarea dispozitiilor legale si a clauzelor contractuale referitoare la timpul normal de lucru de 8 ore zi cinci zile pe saptamana acordarea repaosului saptamanal in doua zile consecutive de regula sambata si duminica sau in alte doua zile stabilite prin contractul colectiv de munca sau regulamentul intern
3504772 facand imposibila recuperarea capacitatii sau fortei de munca si expunand salariatii la riscuri majore fiind o amenintare permanenta la starea de sanatate a salariatilor
3504773 desi federatia sindicatelor independente bcr s a opus argumentat acestor intentii si ulterior hotararii patronatul a ignorat pana la aceasta data punctul nostru de vedere urmand ca in perioada urmatoare sa soseasca probabil notificarea privind concedierea colectiva
3504774 am invederat de fiecare data patronatului ca nu suntem de acord ca indicatorii aferenti produselor subsidiarelor sa faca parte din sistemul bcr de premiere si am recomandat ca acestia sa faca obiectul unor intelegeri separate cu salariati
3504775 nu au fost cresteri foarte mari insa este un climat investitional ceva mai optimist decat in urma cu cateva saptamani daca ne uitam pe graficul indicelui bet pe acest an observam ca au mai existat asemenea perioade insa de fiecare data ele au precedat scaderi de amploare sau in cel mai fericit caz momente de consolidare urmate de scaderi
3504776 ramane sa vedem daca si dupa aceasta crestere va urma tot o corectie de amploare sau preturile vor ramane sus si eventual vor urca in continuare pana acum de fiecare data astfel de momente au generat optimism si i au facut pe multi sa declare ca am trecut de momentul critic al pietei de data aceasta poate chiar asa va fi
3504777 the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop graphics processor unit business
3504778 slashing the cuny budget is a terrible policy and absolutely the wrong way to address the budget shortfall
3504779 we call on gov paterson to consider instead the only fair way to address this crisis that is to increase revenue through a fair taxation structure not to devastate a historic public university and cut off the chance of a college education for thousands of new yorkers
3504780 the doors closing to college for people who depend on cuny for higher education
3504781 it is inconceivable that suny is being directed to absorb these cuts just weeks before classes are scheduled to resume
3504782 this reduction in aid could result in tens of thousands of students being turned away or closed out of courses needed for graduation unless these cuts are restored suny is going to be dismantled
3504783 they provide retraining for people who are out of work or need to upgrade their skills and they are an affordable local option for people to gain access to higher education
3504784 the administration should not decimate its public colleges and universities that are fundamental to keeping jobs and economic growth anchored in new york
3504785 the cuts are unacceptable and nysut will be doing everything in its power to ensure these proposed cuts never happen
3504786 the governor still has time to withdraw these proposed cuts and if he doesnt the legislature will have the opportunity on aug 19 to do whats right
3504787 its bad policy and its one that neither new york nor its students deserve
3504788 there is a clear medical need for therapies that prolong graft function in kidney transplant patients and that more broadly inhibit fibrosis in other clinical settings
3504789 we have made rapid progress on stx 100 since obtaining the program from biogen idec last year this action by the fda should facilitate the development of this drug for transplant patients
3504790 the results for the second quarter including the substantial year over year growth particularly in what has been a difficult economic climate evidence the strength of our core businesses the soundness of our business strategy and the continued and growing popularity of the idols franchise elvis presley and our other assets
3504791 lee and craig have helped guide weyerhaeuser through a period of enormous change
3504792 whether it was through lee s leadership in the establishment of our ilevel approach to the residential wood products market or craig s work with our international and canadian assets each has made a mark on weyerhaeuser and helped position us for future growth we thank them for their contributions
3504793 we have a bureaucracy that is too big in cleveland tn
3504794 lets not let roberts rules of order send us to hell
3504795 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3504796 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3504797 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3504798 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3504799 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3504800 un hombre elegante sin educaci n no sirve otro que decia que si intentaba casa a su hija con alguien que no queria ella era como obligar a no se que de no se que cuando vi esos recortes entendi todo
3504801 there is a lot more snow up there than normal and after receiving the reports about the avalanches and cornices even the most experienced climbers should be very very careful up there
3504802 this is the best evidence to date that elite suppressors can have fully pathogenic virus
3504803 thats a good sign in terms of developing a therapeutic vaccine
3504804 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3504805 we are trying to figure out exactly how the t cells work in her to inhibit viral replication
3504806 we are just trying to see what kind of cytokines they make
3504807 this is the most intense crisis in u s russia relations since the end of the cold war
3504808 this is a setback for u s russia relations and it will make it very difficult for this administration to push forward any kind of positive initiative
3504809 this will confirm the views of those that have been russia critics and have taken the harder line
3504810 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like its from another time
3504811 unless someone has a particularly brilliant idea to give it some impetus there should be a do no damage mode with russia before january 2009
3504812 we thought saakashvili was going to be a nice prudent democrat and failed to look at the signs we talk ourselves into these things
3504813 i am anxious that we may be facing another situation where an innocent person is the victim of a violent crime
3504814 for the residents and neighbourhoods that comprise the manurewa community this prospect is doubly concerning
3504815 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk
3504816 by any measure the residents of weymouth constantly make every effort to ensure that their neighbourhood is safe
3504817 notwithstanding the worrying prospect of the outcome of last nights incident weymouth will remain a great place to live both now and in the future
3504818 they just said a boy was shot in the head
3504819 i came outside and there were ambulances and cops galore
3504820 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3504821 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3504822 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3504823 this is chinese territory you have to obey the rules
3504824 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3504825 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3504826 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3504827 yes the water entering the sewage treatment plant in fountain valley is 100 percent wastewater and has a t d s a measure of water purity t d s stands for total dissolved solids and refers to the amount of trace elements in the water of 1 000 parts per million but after microfiltration and reverse osmosis the t d s is down to 30 poland spring water has a t d s of between 35 and 46 by contrast the raw water in the anaheim basins has a t d s of 600
3504828 some days i feel really great and other days i feel like oh this sucks so much
3504829 the man was exposed while he was at his home in downtown charleston
3504830 people usually know when they have been bitten by a bat
3504831 however bats have small teeth that may leave marks not easily seen and some situations require that you seek medical advice even in the absence of an obvious bite wound
3504832 if you think you have been exposed to the rabies virus through a bite scratch or the saliva of a possibly infected animal immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water
3504833 then be sure to get medical attention and report the incident to dhec
3504834 ban proponents hope it would be challenged in court and eventually entice the supreme court to revisit roe that is where the presidential race comes in democratic sen barack obama has said abortion should remain legal and wants to preserve roe while republican sen john mccain wants roe to be overturned
3504835 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3504836 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3504837 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3504838 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3504839 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3504840 we were about 75 percent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes
3504841 currently i dont see this expanding to the average cell phone yet however we dont really know what technology will spread until it does
3504842 they developers would build their application on our media processing unit which is called a voice engine and what we do is make sure it integrates optimally with the iphone
3504843 we provide the voice engine to application developers so they can concentrate on their core business and know theyve got the highest quality voip using our voice engine which works very well especially under strained conditions on the network making it perfect for a wifi network
3504844 what i can tell you is that were well known for doing the voice side of things and also video so its definitely on our roadmap
3504845 leadership and scale are vital to win especially in a market that is consolidating the combination of complementary dtv expertise from two leading players gives nxp a market leading position and the r amp d synergies required to be the first to bring innovative products to customers specifically we aim to lead in the development of 45nm based technology
3504846 we have completed the acquisition quickly and will maintain this pace by showcasing the joint product portfolio for the first time at ibc 2008 in september
3504847 damn i wish we had one of those in 91
3504848 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3504849 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3504850 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3504851 were in the process of looking at a number of options
3504852 we have not made a decision we are going to merge
3504853 the industry is moving quickly and that made us conclude that its at least something we should explore
3504854 it was a massive investment of energy that took weeks if not months to complete
3504855 at first they asked what might be on top of it and then beneath it
3504856 there was more energy put into the mounds than their own homes
3504857 the absence of evidence tells us they didnt eat and sleep at the mounds so they were not homes or else we would have found something
3504858 for the first time blacks were free and side by side
3504859 their individuality and black culture were no longer prohibited by their white enslavers so when the people came here and had their own land and freedom they many have wanted to leave some kind of trace of who they were
3504860 there hasnt been enough work done in africa to compare to the same periods
3504861 the reclamation of the black loyalists history has so much importance for peoples identity
3504862 once you know your history you have a great sense of who you are
3504863 how we live and behave is discovered there and is a much more honest record of the past
3504864 tourism is one of the few industries that have shown growth this year
3504865 is one of the few places that is seeing an increase in traffic
3504866 hopefully we can see this evolve into an annual event so were not just relying on founders days
3504867 but its going to take a lot more community involvement to make that happen
3504868 were a little slow we were 100 per cent occupied in july
3504869 the first of the season was so so july was better
3504870 theres not a lot of people staying in the area
3504871 they already have reservations somewhere else most visitors to the centre have been looking for places to eat beaches to see and things to do in the area
3504872 there just doesnt seem to be the number of tourists in the area this year
3504873 the mia does not believe this suit has merit and expects the commissioners decision to be upheld
3504874 melanie appears to be very determined to do this with or without dod support so i think it is worthwhile to work with her
3504875 get the story straight from the troops without the filter of the liberal media
3504876 intelligence briefings to very important persons vips and senior officers
3504877 in the attachment you will find the letter of response to centcom u s central command about our gold star family member trip to iraq
3504878 would get very good play in the media and tell our story with these dedicated families of our deceased members
3504879 when i looked into putins eyes i saw three letters a k a g and a b
3504880 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
3504881 net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years leichtman research group has been tracking the industry
3504882 the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of traditional dsl service
3504883 its easy to take prices down but its very hard to bring them back up
3504884 its worth noting that the telcos stopped promoting their broadband plans in the second quarter because thats when students are leaving school and disconnecting its a seasonal disconnect period its overly simplistic to say broadband subscriber growth slowed down because of this or that just a few years ago the telecom providers were criticized for offering 15 dsl service
3504885 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3504886 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3504887 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3504888 you know things change we have a small congregation and a big church we need to change go with the times i guess
3504889 no real connection to the church i just thought it was an attractive decorative item so what are you going to do with it probably put it at home in a family room as a bookshelf and possibly put a bible on it
3504890 well its a warm building a warm congregation friendly congregation you feel happy here its like a home
3504891 i have 1100 1150 1100 1150 sold in the back for 1100
3504892 people are going to be quite busy with this load
3504893 you can be assured people are using the viewer to share information with partners customers and internally given the popularity of the office suite and how much businesses tend to use access
3504894 given that the vulnerability is web based and graphical you definitely want to pay some special attention to that one
3504895 utorrent and bittorrent mainline have included an unpatched unicode stack overflow in its code base for at least 2 years it was finally patched on the 5th august 2008 with 1 8 release candidate 7
3504896 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3504897 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3504898 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3504899 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3504900 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3504901 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3504902 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3504903 if youre not involved in the sport im not sure you can fully appreciate it
3504904 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3504905 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3504906 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3504907 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3504908 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning
3504909 weve had a lot of inspiration from girls to write songs
3504910 bad things happen and it gives you an idea for a song were really open to each others ideas which is really important when youre writing songs
3504911 i cant decide if the announcers are sexist or just bored
3504912 at 9 there was a five minute clip about what michael phelps likes to eat which concluded with a list of what he had for breakfast
3504913 this is how sieg heil got started and no im not saying obama is hitler i just think people should be careful about slipping into a personality cult for a charismatic leader
3504914 our symbol o is about much more than barack obama
3504915 barack obama is a very exciting catalyst at first we were bothered by the negative and vulgar comments made when someone attacks something you hold dear it hurts but as we continued to read all the comments we realized just how silly and frankly unimaginative most of them were many didnt even take the time to read the article people came out against the peace emblem in the sixties making accusations that it was an anti christian symbol an inverted crucifix a satanic symbol and a communist sign but like our o the goodness inherent in the peace symbol persevered and today it is the international symbol for peace the hand sign for peace was first a british form of giving someone the bird then it became a war cry for victory today it is a symbol of peace amp love once again goodness persevered we too will persevere bring your hands together over your head to make a large o and join us in our fight to take america back vote for barack obama
3504916 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3504917 i saw just a couple of pictures that he boston globe nbsp united states nbsp
3504918 no other pc manufacturer delivers the sheer quality power and performance and cutting edge innovation packed into this mobile workstation
3504919 we want to offer them transparency and choice about the options that are available to them
3504920 this is in addition to our existing opt out when yahoo serves customized advertising on third party networks
3504921 we believe this is particularly important since it is not always obvious to all users that ads are served by different entities among web sites
3504922 consistent with the terms of the providers existing customer notices and
3504923 additional steps to protect our customers privacy including confirming their interest in receiving tailored advertisements and by securing an additional opt in consent from them
3504924 customers shouldnt be required to read complex and confusing legal updates about privacy policy
3504925 the companies really failed to fully disclose all the data collection and targeting they routinely do
3504926 there is a huge demand for the first generation iphones because the battery for the older iphones is stronger
3504927 we are giving anywhere from 200 to 300 in instant credit
3504928 the base line of our concept is how do we encourage reuse and keep things out of the landfill
3504929 we hold on to it and it sits in our desk drawer and it depreciates and in the end it ends up in the landfill
3504930 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex
3504931 when it comes to video games parents should know that what they play is a resource that helps demystify one of the most popular and challenging forms of entertainment their kids are into
3504932 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play
3504933 of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3504934 the media takes advantage of the old adage that if it bleeds it leads
3504935 watch the evening news how many positive news stories are there and how many stories do you see about murders robberies and fires its rare when the local news reports a positive story
3504936 we definitely see hactivism taking place from people who have a political ideology and jump on the bandwagon with bots to help promote their opinions and viewpoints whether that be for war or against war or for or against certain countries
3504937 this appears to be more of an intelligence gathering effort rather than a distributed denial of service attack
3504938 the lightweight attacks that took place well over a month prior to this incident indicates other actors with motives different than hactivism are likely involved by the incident
3504939 it appears that someone was sizing up what the resources and capabilities of servers of interest were
3504940 when these attacks first took place before the hactivism jumped on the bandwagon who was behind that and who organized those attacks
3504941 the sequence of events tends to force you to acknowledge that there are likely other actors and other motives involved other than just the reactive hactivism weve seen online
3504942 man glad to finally get that 42 off my back
3504943 the press thinks were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori
3504944 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3504945 so i dont know if its about the money either
3504946 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3504947 the cw has no deal with tori spelling to appear on
3504948 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3504949 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road

3504964 security is a national issue the people expect our courageous armed forces to take even the slightest threats seriously
3504965 what we are talking about here are threats from outside the region
3504966 to all my arab brothers and sisters in neighboring countries i must say that our security is your security and your security is ours
3504967 thats kind of the finishing unit for gas at the plant its kind of like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer we just cant produce product right now
3504968 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3504969 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up
3504970 their refining margins would drop because of excess supply so theres no incentive at all for them to do that
3504971 if i was an oil company i would like to know in 10 years when im going to have this refinery built what the eventual specs are going to be and what the emission standards are going to be
3504972 wed rather just be putting gasoline in the ground and letting our customers fill up their tanks but were in a situation where we dont have the volume of gasoline that we normally do
3504973 were getting our hands on any trucks we can to source product internationally and locally
3504974 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3504975 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3504976 go back to making tea for brian mulroney and stay out of serious peoples business
3504977 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3504978 if liberal mps are allowed to publicly use offensive language like thibaults without consequence it shows that stephane dions commitment to women in politics rings hollow
3504979 begs the question does stephane dion believe the best use of womans talent is making tea
3504980 its the kind of negative thing that gets a lot of publicity so it needs a strong reaction
3504981 otherwise a lot of women are sitting there saying why would i want to get into that kind of macho schoolyard boys game
3504982 thibault issued the apology on his own dion did not need to talk to him we consider the matter closed
3504983 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face

3504985 without symbols our lives would be as spiritually impoverished as sleep without dreams
3504986 this paper and the work that this group has done on reconsolidation and drug taking behaviors represent some of the most promising avenues of research for treating addiction
3504987 i dont know of any other study in the field of drug addiction where an acute treatment causes long term cessation of drug taking behavior in rodent models
3504988 this is an example of hypothesis driven basic research that can be readily translated to the treatment of cocaine addiction in humans
3504989 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such treatments would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
3504990 this is a new approach to the treatment of drug addiction that has great potential additionally this might also be used to treat other neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by maladaptive memories including post traumatic stress and phobic anxiety disorders
3504991 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3504992 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3504993 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3504994 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3504995 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3504996 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3504997 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3504998 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3504999 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage
3505000 ultimately we could also find out how massage helps not just exercise induced muscle injury but swelling and pain associated with other medical conditions as well

3505003 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3505004 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3505005 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3505006 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3505007 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3505008 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3505009 countries that neighbor russia will think deeply about how to protect themselves how to guarantee security
3505010 the ability and the readiness to use force that russia has demonstrated shows that russia is a very serious power now
3505011 the aggressor has been punished and sustained very serious losses
3505012 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions
3505013 we have not achieved peace yet but we have achieved a provisional cease fire
3505014 our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner
3505015 the united states has used contractors during previous military operations although not to the current extent according to rough historical data the ratio of about one contractor employee for every member of the u s armed forces in the iraq theater is at least 2 5 times higher than that ratio during any other major u s conflict although it is roughly comparable with the ratio during operations in the balkans in the 1990s

3505018 ferguson realizes we werent too far away from them when they were at the very top of their game
3505019 i dont think they have another level to go to
3505020 they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3505021 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years ronaldo has been unbelievable and i dont think youll see that again wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3505022 with the injuries weve had as players we can all raise the bar a little bit
3505023 with it being that close in the premiership and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money
3505024 outstanding progress coming from a team thats in their 30s
3505025 weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3505026 hopefully if we can keep players fit especially around christmas well do well
3505027 seeing them win the league trophy was frustrating it doesnt get any better seeing them lift the trophy that we made ours when mourinho first took over we want it back and thats what were aiming for
3505028 we came together an awful lot with the things that happened with the change of manager last year
3505029 the players were taking full responsibility to keeping everyone motivated i saw the team grow last year off the pitch as a really big unit
3505030 the manager enjoys a laugh off the pitch he enjoys the batter but when you get on the pitch he likes things done right and done properly which you will always get at our club
3505031 but hes definitely got that fear factor you dont want to go too far or upset him at all but hes got the respect of the whole team because of what he has achieved in football but when it comes down to it hes a really nice man with good people around him
3505032 the community cant place their full confidence in that kind of inquiry
3505033 i have sympathy for the problems of the third world but i dont believe violence and thievery are the answer
3505034 they wanted dollars but we only had a few quetzales with us on the boat
3505035 this case is a particularly tragic one when you look at the people involved
3505036 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3505037 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3505038 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3505039 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3505040 and hopefully some of us will hear the national anthem at the end of the week
3505041 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3505042 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3505043 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3505044 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3505045 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point
3505046 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve

3505052 a number of members of the hollywood community including brad pitt ben affleck and matt damon offered to help raise funds for barack but it was with george that he struck up this amazing affinity

3505058 had deployed equipment throughout its network to monitor the content of its customers internet connections and selectively block specific types of connections known as peer to peer p2p connections
3505059 the commission also concluded that comcasts practices are not minimally intrusive as the company claims but rather are invasive and have significant effects the commission found that comcast monitors its customers connections using deep packet inspection and then determines how it will route some connections based not on their destinations but on their contents in essence comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein

3505085 es hat mir anfangs viel spa gemacht und ich habe auch viel positives mitgenommen

3505088 90 prozent unserer arbeit macht inzwischen die beratung von unternehmen aus die mit der organisation in kontakt gekommen sind

3505090 schl sselpositionen in der wirtschaft zu besetzen und unternehmen unter kontrolle zu bringen
3505091 da scientology jetzt totale freiheit bringt mu sie auch die macht und autorit t haben totale disziplin zu fordern

3505095 der einzige grund warum lrh sekten k rzel fuer l ron hubbard die kirche gr ndete bestand darin den leuten dieses planeten direkt on policy und in tech dianetik zu verkaufen und zu liefern
3505096 als hauptquelle der dienstleistungen einsetzen die fuer kunden oder klienten erbracht werden

3505105 es wird nicht kundenorientiert gearbeitet sondern nach dem motto wie ziehe ich die leute am schnellsten ber den tisch
3505106 scientology ist wie ein glitschiges gebilde in das man hineinrutscht ohne es zu merken
3505107 dort gibt es einen harten kern der wei wo es lang geht
3505108 betriebsfrieden und die betriebliche ordnung durch seine werbeaktivit ten schwer gest rt wurden
3505109 wir gehen auch davon aus da scientologen betriebsgeheimnisse ausspionieren und das so gewonnene wissen zu eigenen zwecken verwenden
3505110 dazu kann und darf es aber nicht sein da bund und l nder scientology weiter als religion betrachten und die bek mpfung bei ministerien fuer jugend oder familie ansiedeln

3505164 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future

3505166 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
3505167 several bothersome headlines related to major financial firms have tempered some of the bullish enthusiasm

3505171 we provide the voice engine to application developers so they can concentrate on their core business and know theyve got the highest quality voip using our voice engine which works very well especially under strained conditions on the network making it perfect for a wifi network
3505172 what i can tell you is that were well known for doing the voice side of things and also video so its definitely on our roadmap
3505173 its a nice trade for everybody the criminals get a little protection the russian government gets to have something happen without having their fingerprints on it thats the assumption like estonia we dont have links to the russian government but its not a fluke where we magically have this happen when a shooting war starts
3505174 this looks to me like more than just some grassroots hacktivist inspired attacks
3505175 but at the same time theres no way to link it to a state sponsored type of attack its somewhere in the middle it certainly has criminal elements
3505176 this was really targeted at preventing georgia from presenting its message to the world through its communications platform and the web
3505177 obviously the georgians can talk to reporters but as more and more communications move to the internet with distributed blogs and all that all the attacks that have happened were targeted at preventing georgia from quickly and easily presenting the facts or their spin on whats going on
3505178 anywhere you have organized crime they leap in to take advantage of the news of the day
3505179 if theres an armed conflict between two nations and there are criminals in both nations they would leap to take advantage of that dont you think
3505180 its a neat idea and a good approach for them
3505181 rather than go back and try to do everything into one super integrated piece if you can do it and hit a target window for the market more power to you
3505182 by having internal architectures that pipeline the thing it does give them a performance boost over an individual version with the two 4870s
3505183 amd ati has been gaining momentum in the overall pc discrete graphics vendor market
3505184 as the first quarter of 2008 data in my file implies amd ati is after a tough 2007 turning its market share back around my understanding is that amd atis new products are gaining traction with pc oems original equipment manufacturers and graphics card makers
3505185 its hard to predict what nvidia will do they could do a board like amd has done or they could go to a more powerful single chip they have the gtx 280 and thats a pretty powerful board now and well just have to wait and see if they can get the gtx 3 to go faster
3505186 basically this is crossfire on one board so basically if you have two pci peripheral component interconnect slots in your computer you can put two of these boards in and end up with four gpus
3505187 each one of those chips is about 1 2 teraflops in compute power if you put eight of them in the board youre talking about a 10 teraflop supercomputer do the math with the board coming up at about 500 if you put four of them in there you spend 2 000 on the board and say you spend another 1 000 on your computer so you spend 3 000 for a 10 teraflop computer i think thats just astounding
3505188 the entire mountaineer nation is thrilled with the great news that we received from the ncaa today pat liebig has been granted his senior year of eligibility and we could not be happier

3505193 pensei em fazer novelas que espelhassem a nossa realidade e acabassem com o manique smo exagerado dos personagens da televis o os her is com todas as virtudes e os maus com todos os defeitos procurei tamb m introduzir problemas reais do pa s como o preconceito racial o conflito de gera es o fanatismo religioso o poder de corrup o do dinheiro etc ao lado disso fui acrescentando um elemento pouco freq ente nas telenovelas at ent o o humor o humor mesmo na trag dia pois como diz o poeta ao lado de quem chora h sempre algu m que ri

3505195 se o autor continuar a ter de escrever seis cap tulos por semana e esses cap tulos continuarem a ser gravados a toque de caixa todo o esfor o de um bom texto esbarrar nessa limita o isso n o diminui a nossa capacidade de cria o mas diminui a qualidade dessa cria o

3505203 well actually brett youre here because after months of vacillating on your retirement and putting the packers through hell and forcing them into using a valuable draft pick on an extra quarterback because they didnt know whether youd be playing for them this season you tried to bully them into either making you the starter or trading you to a team of your choice like a prima donna you put your own desires ahead of the welfare of the organization to which you professed loyalty now youve been dumped on one of the nfls most desperate franchises because no one else wanted you

3505221 one would have to employ an individual full time just to remove this illegal imagery
3505222 obviously a 78 point lead is pretty healthy but were going to have to still try to gain points on helio
3505223 we need an 82 point lead to have it sewn up after the next race at sonoma that would be nice but in all reality i think well be battling for the championship to the last race
3505224 at that point i saw the lights on the dash and they were all lit
3505225 the fuel meter was off a little bit but it wasnt off so far that i expected to get to the finish line first
3505226 if you keep your foot on the throttle the engine wont respond because its trying to suck more fuel and theres nothing there what you try to do is lift a little bit to make sure you keep some revs thats what i did when it coughed i kept trying to step on and off to see if i could get more fuel unfortunately it didnt happen we took a chance
3505227 i still cant believe how close we were we were just a few hundred yards short
3505228 they said there were a few guys who had gone on an alternate strategy they were fighting pretty hard i didnt think coming out from this that we had enough to win it definitely took him castroneves having a problem with fuel in order for us to win it
3505229 coming through turns 3 and 4 and watching helio run out of fuel with a few hundred feet to go was pretty special i must say its nice to be in that position
3505230 weve got to start capitalizing when we have cars that can win races
3505231 dixon had a bit of speed on us but i think we had a better car in traffic it was between him and i to win the race and its just unfortunate that we didnt
3505232 my car was just a little too loose on the last stint to make the move
3505233 we planned on it cooling down late in the race and we knew we would be in the money on the last 50 laps
3505234 we lost a lot of spots in the pits on that last stop

3505250 when i was 12 or 13 years old she had told me that in 18th century japan the geisha who were known for their beauty and their porcelain skin needed something to remove all the heavy make up they wore
3505251 at the time the make up contained lead which was very damaging to their skin
3505252 so they tried everything to take it off and nothing worked and then they tried the nightingale droppings and it not only worked but it left their skin smooth
3505253 when i explain to my customers they think i misspoke because of my accent
3505254 but after they understand many of them are willing to trust me and give it a try
3505255 she e mailed me some information i definitely needed to know more before i committed to the procedure
3505256 but then i thought about it and the japanese have been doing it for such a long time and the geishas have such beautiful skin even though they put such harsh chemicals on it
3505257 it doesnt feel as abrasive as some other facials and it smells organic
3505258 and it doesnt tingle or burn it just sort of stays there its a really simple calming facial

3505312 we were able to characterize the motion of the receptor proteins in the membrane in real time as they respond to the antigen
3505313 perhaps more importantly we learned the cell membrane is really complicated and highly structured rather than fluid and unstructured as is the prevailing notion
3505314 when proteins bind antigens they begin to cluster this causes other proteins to thrash around that sends a message from the membrane to the cell nucleus that somethings wrong
3505315 but if there are places on the membrane that are walled off and an antigen lands there the cell may not be notified theres a problem no protein no warning

3505319 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3505320 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3505321 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3505322 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future
3505323 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3505324 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times
3505325 we want families to provide their child with an environment in which they not only learn how to eat healthy but have the opportunity to practice what they learn
3505326 and by partnering with parents as teachers we now can disseminate this program to their sites nationwide this further impacts healthy eating patterns in parents and their preschool children

3505375 yo respaldo la decisi n que tom el gobierno sin ninguna duda ya que se ha nombrado como juez ad hoc a un profesional bastante destacado en el campo del derecho internacional
3505376 orrego no me merece ninguna objeci n y si el ministerio de relaciones exteriores hizo esta nominaci n todos debemos cuadrarnos con ella
3505377 ser a tremendamente negativo que se cuestionara el nombramiento una vez ya producido porque le estar amos restando calidad jur dica a un juez que representar a chile
3505378 como representante y presidente del consejo expreso mi preocupaci n porque las decisiones que se adoptan por nuestro organismo deben ser respetadas por otros organismos constitucionales concretamente por el tribunal constitucional sin embargo lo prudente es examinar primero las resoluciones que pudieran emitirse y nosotros respetaremos la decisi n que se tome al respecto
3505379 el consejo ha ejercido su defensa a trav s de su procurador p blico y ha estado informando en estos casos manteniendo la posici n de defensa de las facultades constitucionales especialmente disciplinarios del consejo que espero que se respeten ntegramente

3505382 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3505383 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3505384 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3505385 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future
3505386 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3505387 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times
3505388 we want families to provide their child with an environment in which they not only learn how to eat healthy but have the opportunity to practice what they learn
3505389 and by partnering with parents as teachers we now can disseminate this program to their sites nationwide this further impacts healthy eating patterns in parents and their preschool children
3505390 we were able to characterize the motion of the receptor proteins in the membrane in real time as they respond to the antigen
3505391 perhaps more importantly we learned the cell membrane is really complicated and highly structured rather than fluid and unstructured as is the prevailing notion
3505392 when proteins bind antigens they begin to cluster this causes other proteins to thrash around that sends a message from the membrane to the cell nucleus that somethings wrong
3505393 but if there are places on the membrane that are walled off and an antigen lands there the cell may not be notified theres a problem no protein no warning
3505394 when a cell settles on a piece of bare thin glass
3505395 the membrane of the cell by definition is snuggled up against the glass and available to the radiation field
3505396 it was like using cameras to watch individual bank robbers move around as a holdup progressed

3505407 net broadband additions in the quarter were the fewest of any quarter in the seven years leichtman research group has been tracking the industry
3505408 the decline in additions this quarter compared to the same period last year was exacerbated by verizon and at amp ts emphasis on selling higher speed fios and u verse bundled services often at the expense of traditional dsl service
3505409 its easy to take prices down but its very hard to bring them back up
3505410 its worth noting that the telcos stopped promoting their broadband plans in the second quarter because thats when students are leaving school and disconnecting its a seasonal disconnect period its overly simplistic to say broadband subscriber growth slowed down because of this or that just a few years ago the telecom providers were criticized for offering 15 dsl service
3505411 it should almost cost like event vod like for a friday night boxing match
3505412 this is the best evidence to date that elite suppressors can have fully pathogenic virus
3505413 thats a good sign in terms of developing a therapeutic vaccine
3505414 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3505415 we are trying to figure out exactly how the t cells work in her to inhibit viral replication

3505420 google s acquisition of begun is likely to significantly alter the advertising channel allowing google to enhance monetisation of its already significant 35 share of the search market this will likely challenge the current dominance of yandex and although we continue to assume that yandex will maintain its leading position we believe that there is now debate as to whether russia will become a google country
3505421 although google does not disclose information about its russian operations industry sources estimate that it had approximately 5 revenue share in 2006 and 2007 implying a search monetisation 4 7 times lower than that of yandex this appears to be caused by google s inability thus far to adjust to peculiarities of the russian payment system i e cash direct money transfer etc rather than cheques as well as the lack of a direct sales force this weakness was the key underpinning and rationale for the begun transaction
3505422 overall rankings for the russian market have changed significantly over the past year with two social networking sites

3505436 our q2 financial performance was disappointing the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop gpu business we have a great product line up and having taken the necessary pricing actions we are strongly positioned again our focus now is to drive cost improvements and to further enhance our competitiveness through the many exciting initiatives we have planned for the rest of the year
3505437 in contrast the rest of our businesses did not exhibit the same dynamics as our desktop business the notebook gpu mcp and professional solutions groups grew a combined 27 percent year over year

3505452 the status quo in south ossetia and abkhazia is no longer possible
3505453 the invasion plan was rehearsed and perfected during georgian american war games in georgia
3505454 it is hard to imagine that georgia could dare to launch its aggression against south ossetia without a nod from abroad
3505455 we hate to think that the u s gave a green light for the assault
3505456 wealth is about so much more than pounds or euros or dollars can ever measure its time we admitted that theres more to life than money its time we focused not just on gdp but on gwb general well being
3505457 generally the powers are being used to respond to residents complaints about fly tippers rogue traders and those defrauding the council tax or housing benefit system
3505458 time and again these are just the type of crimes that residents tell us that they want to see tackled
3505459 without these powers councils would not be able to provide the level of reassurance and protection local people demand and deserve
3505460 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him
3505461 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
3505462 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
3505463 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
3505464 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
3505465 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

3505469 this is the hour of mourning we must respect our dead
3505470 you can feel it in your veins cant you the crowd and the forces are just testing each other we got away with it today but i cant say the same about tomorrow theres anger bubbling over whats happening in the valley
3505471 we dont know what to do now where to go
3505472 we cant go ahead and we are not being allowed to return because there is a curfew all the way down to jammu and it is getting cold
3505473 there was a disruption on the road for a few days about a fortnight ago but the road has been clear since who says trucks are not going it is only here that the security forces have blocked our way nobody else did
3505474 the nearby streams got depleted and thus locals were forced to fetch water on donkeys from very far areas sometimes you go for five km to bring 40 liter of water which can only be enough for cooking and drinking purposes you do washing or cleaning of clothes once a week
3505475 though i love my village the circumstances and the lack of water forced me to leave for the city where government water networks are available i think the increase of population is responsible for the water crisis as well as the decreasing level of rainfall he added

3505480 this may be the first marriage in which a woman assumed the role of a male qazi and performed a marriage
3505481 at least in north india this is a first though in the south i heard about some experimental marriage like this happening
3505482 why should the male folk be assigned all the crucial works of society
3505483 a marriage of this kind cannot pass the test of law as a woman qazi does not have any locus standi in a court of law
3505484 we fail to understand why there is a need for a leadership change soren should point out lacunae in the koda governments functioning which warrants a change
3505485 the process of installing soren as chief minister should have begun by consulting the eight independent ministers
3505486 it was ironical to see upa mps backing sorens demand for chief ministership the fact is that he needs mlas support to assume the hot seat
3505487 as independent ministers we were able to have our way with koda at times even arm twist him but we would not be able to take such liberties with soren that is the main reason why we are opposed to guruji
3505488 things are not fully in its control in the state
3505489 the congress will support soren if he forms the government in the state
3505490 the high command has directed that the chief minister should resign the resignation should come immediately any time
3505491 this is an intra upa affair we are attentive to the aspirations of different sections of supporting parties we are hopeful that the problem would be sorted out amicably within a week to the satisfaction of all concerned
3505492 i have no problem if soren became the chief minister but if soren falls short of majority it will lead to the imposition of presidents rule there
3505493 let the upa first decide who they wo uld like to have as chief minister i will decide my future action plan only after the jmm formally withdraws support to my government shibu soren is our guardian and the jmms support is very important for us as of now i need not worry about anything
3505494 one day in the life of a nation of 1 1 billion people
3505495 the last four years since athens havent been easy a number of issues made my decision to go ahead with the next olympics a difficult one issues which i wouldnt want to make public

3505497 i have lived my life well and lived it for others which has given me immense satisfaction it is not easy when you have such thoughts because too many emotions get involved but thats the way i am
3505498 my mind was completely blank i just went for it and was lucky it went my way

3505505 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3505506 the caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are you know almost hateful and we want this to be the beginning of the end we want this to be the end of hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes

3505567 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3505568 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first
3505569 the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people
3505570 well if im nice enough gentle and patient he will care again
3505571 why is he doing so well when im in so much pain
3505572 what is wrong with me that he doesnt want to be with me anymore
3505573 these study results suggest that many in hollywood are actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently showing it in a negative manner even more troubling than the marginalization of marriage and glorification of non marital sex on television is tvs recent obsession with outr sexual expression children and teens are now exposed to a host of sexual behaviors that less than a generation ago would have been considered off limits for broadcast television
3505574 behaviors that were once seen as fringe immoral or socially destructive have been given the stamp of approval by the television industry and recent studies show that children are influenced by those messages throughout much of the history of broadcast television the networks adhered to a voluntary code of conduct which stipulated that respect should be maintained for the sanctity of marriage and the value of the home our report finds that not only are the boundaries no longer respected they have been obliterated
3505575 for many years parents have worried about televisions glamorization of destructive sexual behavior this important new report suggests another cause for concern the de glamorization of marriage statistics show that the overwhelming majority of americans feel satisfied and fulfilled by their marriages the notion that sex outside of marriage is inherently more exciting more important more worthy as the subject of story telling is a toxic message for parents and children alike
3505576 the press thinks were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori
3505577 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3505578 35 000 50 000 per episode versus spellings proposed salary of

3505581 i hate to lose tangela for a few weeks while she rehabs from the surgery but knew that it was something that needed to be done and in the long run it is the best decision to keep her healthy
3505582 it gives us a chance to play some different lineups play some different guys evaluate some things and experiment with some things
3505583 if this game we should lose from the beginning by 10 points then ok
3505584 but now we can win this game and we did not
3505585 we started the game with good discipline good defense i dont know why but in the fourth quarter we made bad decisions before we started for sure we didnt think that we could win but this situation changed and at that point we should win easy
3505586 we had every chance to win and in the last two or three minutes of regulation time i thought we were winning
3505587 but we were too nervous by the end of the game to harvest victory
3505588 but this game shows that we do not have the experience like them when they are losing by 10 points they do not get nervous they just get one point one point and play their way back eventing competition jumping
3505589 my plan was to play the fedex cup but i dont know if i have quite enough points to be safe
3505590 so i might have to go back and earn some more
3505591 i still have an opportunity to qualify but that opportunity is now off the world points list rather than the euros and im a long way off of that list i basically have to win simple as that

3505625 e xpanding nato would be the most fateful error of american policy in the entire post cold war era such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic anti western and militaristic tendencies in russian opinion to have an adverse effect on the development of russian democracy to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to east west relations and to impel russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking
3505626 confrontational rhetoric notwithstanding russias leaders are conscious of their strategic limitations indeed i would characterize russian policy under putin as driven in a quest for a reliable strategic partner with america being the preferred choice but the movement of the western security system from the elbe river to the approaches to moscow brings home russias decline in a way bound to generate a russian emotion that will inhibit the solution of all other issues it should be kept on the table without forcing the issue to determine the possibilities of making progress on other issues

3505655 the obvious explanation of the silence of the new testament on the triune name and the use of another jesus name formula in acts and paul is that this other formula was the earlier and the triune formula is a later addition
3505656 the baptismal command in its matthew 28 19 form can not be the historical origin of christian baptism at the very least it must be assumed that the text has been transmitted in a form expanded by the catholic church
3505657 it is often affirmed that the words in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost are not the ipsissima verba exact words of jesus but
3505658 the testimony for the wide distribution of the simple baptismal formula in the name of jesus down into the second century is so overwhelming that even in matthew 28 19 the trinitarian formula was later inserted the catholic encyclopedia ii page 263 was changed from the name of jesus christ to the words father son and holy spirit by the catholic church in the second century
3505659 the trinity is not demonstrable by logic or by scriptural proofs the term trias was first used by theophilus of antioch c ad 180 the term trinity not found in scripture
3505660 the chief trinitarian text in the nt is the baptismal formula in mt 28 19
3505661 jesus however cannot have given his disciples this trinitarian order of baptism after his resurrection for the new testament knows only one baptism in the name of jesus acts 2 38 8 16 10 43 19 5 gal 3 27 rom 6 3 1 cor 1 13 15 which still occurs even in the second and third centuries while the trinitarian formula occurs only in matt 28 19 and then only again in the didache 7 1 and justin apol 1 61 finally the distinctly liturgical character of the formula is strange it was not the way of jesus to make such formulas the formal authenticity of matt 28 19 must be disputed
3505662 it may be that this formula triune matthew 28 19 so far as the fullness of its expression is concerned is a reflection of the man made liturgical usage
3505663 modern critics claim this formula is falsely ascribed to jesus and that it represents later catholic church tradition for nowhere in the book of acts or any other book of the bible is baptism performed with the name of the trinity
3505664 it may be that this trinitarian formula so far as the fullness of its expression is concerned is a reflection of the catholic liturgical usage
3505665 all but the most conservative scholars agree that at least the latter part of this command triune part of matthew 28 19
3505666 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
3505667 the church of the first days ad 33 did not observe this world wide trinitarian commandment even if they knew it the command to baptize into the threefold trinity name the bible commentary 1919 page 723
3505668 the command to baptize into the threefold name is a late doctrinal expansion
3505669 as to the rite of baptism it was normally consummated as a bath in which the one receiving baptism completely submerged and if possible in flowing water as the allusions of acts 8 36 heb 10 22 barn 11 11 permit us to gather and as did 7 1 3 specifically says according to the last passage the apocryphal catholic didache suffices in case of the need if water is three times poured false catholic sprinkling doctrine on the head the one baptizing names over the one being baptized the name of the lord jesus christ
3505670 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
3505671 there is little doubt as to the sacramental nature of baptism by the middle of the first century in the circles represented by the pauline epistles and it is indisputable in the second century
3505672 go ye into all the world and make disciples of all gentiles nations baptizing them in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit
3505673 go ye into all the world and make diciples of all the gentiles in my name
3505674 1 in the actual description of baptism in the didache the trine trinity formula is used in the instructions for the eucharist communion the condition for admission is baptism in the name of the lord it is obvious that in the case of an eleventh century manuscript the trine formula was almost certain to be inserted in the description of baptism while the less usual formula had a chance of escaping notice when it was only used incidentally
3505675 the passages in acts and the letters of st paul these passages seem to point to the earliest form as baptism in the name of the lord
3505676 is it possible to reconcile these facts with the belief that christ commanded his disciples to baptize in the trine form had christ given such a command it is urged the apostolic church would have followed him and we should have some trace of this obedience in the new testament no such trace can be found the only explanation of this silence according to the anti traditional view is this the short christological jesus name formula was the original and the longer trine formula was a later development
3505677 while the power of the episcopate and the significance of churches of apostolical catholic foundation was thus greatly enhanced the gnostic crisis saw a corresponding development of man made non inspired spurious creed at least in the west some form of instruction before baptism was common by the middle of the second century at rome this developed apparently between 150 and 175 and probably in opposition to marcionite gnosticism into an explication of the baptismal formula of matthew 28 19 the earliest known form of the so called apostles creed
3505678 the basic form of our matthew 28 19 trinitarian profession of faith took shape during the course of the second and third centuries in connection with the ceremony of baptism so far as its place of origin is concerned the text matthew 28 19 came from the city of rome
3505679 with one word and voice he said to his disciples
3505680 see conybeare this shorter reading preserves the symmetrical rhythm of the passage whereas the triadic formula fits awkwardly into the structure as one might expect if it were an interpolation see h b green cf howard hill

3505783 we definitely see hactivism taking place from people who have a political ideology and jump on the bandwagon with bots to help promote their opinions and viewpoints whether that be for war or against war or for or against certain countries
3505784 this appears to be more of an intelligence gathering effort rather than a distributed denial of service attack
3505785 the lightweight attacks that took place well over a month prior to this incident indicates other actors with motives different than hactivism are likely involved by the incident
3505786 it appears that someone was sizing up what the resources and capabilities of servers of interest were
3505787 when these attacks first took place before the hactivism jumped on the bandwagon who was behind that and who organized those attacks
3505788 the sequence of events tends to force you to acknowledge that there are likely other actors and other motives involved other than just the reactive hactivism weve seen online

3505801 the federal government has awarded 85 billion in contracts for work in the iraq theater through 2007 if you included this year the total would exceed 100 billion roughly one of every 5 for the cost of the war in iraq
3505802 we are really running our military at a much harder rate without the kind of rest and retraining that the military itself says is necessary given the level of operations we are engaged in were it not for the contractors we would presumably be running an even less sustainable pace of activity for military personnel
3505803 its like the old soviet days they were making an example of us for ukraine and others to see
3505804 what we need is to get out of a crisis i just want to push people to dialogue
3505805 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3505806 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very considerable losses
3505807 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3505808 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3505809 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
3505810 schools hospital houses all infrastructure is ruined theres no water no electricity we will rebuild it
3505811 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3505812 no plans to force anyone from power this is not in our political culture at all
3505813 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3505814 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer
3505815 the difficulty is that im not a texas oil tycoon arab sheikh or a russian oligarch so well have to do it carefully but theres no question my ambition is absolutely to stay in the premier league
3505816 the important thing will be to hang on in there in that first season be smart the way you buy and recruit and fortunately ive got a great advantage in that respect with having phil brown running the team because hes already gone through that experience with bolton
3505817 the advantage about the premier league is that if you can stay there after the first year and get that 17th spot or better the next year a bunch of money trickles down and the next year another bunch of money trickles down and like in any business you build your asset base and start to re invest in your team to keep it going
3505818 im not underestimating for one minute how hard it will be to achieve our single focus which will be to finish 17th or better and that is the only thing well try to do
3505819 were better prepared than derby and well have nearly all the money available to us to invest in the team and we can look at other things on the basis of a pro scouting team the club never had before which phil put in place with my backing
3505820 i do believe that we can stay there and then notch our way up the division id liken us to more bolton or reading rather than watford in our ambition
3505821 the way bolton embraced the premier league and the way sam allardyce with phils support attacked that challenge is something that a lot of other clubs have subsequently emulated and certainly phil has brought some of those lessons to our club already
3505822 were trying to behave as a club who are ready for premier league life but equally you need to be smart enough to take other peoples ideas and mould them into your own situation i think we will come up with a few ideas of our own so that maybe in a few years time people will be citing us as the template rather bolton
3505823 if you want to find a club thats off the beaten track you should come to kingston upon hull but actually this works as a strength for us because we are a bit of an oasis in the desert in terms of footballing excellence
3505824 weve got a manager who is used to life in the premier league and an assistant brian horton who has been used to life in the top flight you will find the culture around the club is one in which premier league footballers feel very comfortable
3505825 there is absolutely a single focus on playing football there is no other circus around its not like being in a major city like london birmingham or manchester where youve got lots of other distractions
3505826 the boys who come here come to play football they live their football and have a very nice quality of life in the villages around the city but actually they enjoy the fact theyre not in the middle of a circus the whole time its a very rewarding place for them to be
3505827 im absolutely sure there will be some people who will find negatives because they want to be jack the lad in the city immersed in all the razzmatazz but by the same token maybe you will get the better character and player who wants to actually come to this environment

3505931 this is an important milestone for wcs the people of andrews and lea counties and the states of texas and vermont as members of the texas compact
3505932 in addition to providing more than 75 new jobs at our andrews county facility this license will ensure that texas and vermont hospitals universities power plants and other enterprises will be able to continue operating with the knowledge that there is an assured solution for the permanent disposal of their llrw with the closure of the barnwell facility in south carolina last month texas hospital and university administrators have expressed concern regarding the need for a commercial facility that can properly dispose of class a b and c llrw so that the diagnosis treatment and research of cancer and other life threatening diseases which generate such wastes can continue the only u s commercial facility currently authorized to accept llrw is limited to disposal of class a waste the barriers to entry in this industry are enormous it is very unlikely another llrw disposal facility will be opened in the foreseeable future as more than 1 billion has been invested since 1980 by the state of texas and others in unsuccessful attempts to license and open such a facility the tceq recently issued a byproduct material disposal license to wcs when the llrw disposal license is finalized we believe wcs will have the broadest range of capabilities of any commercial enterprise in the u s for the storage treatment and disposal of hazardous toxic low level and mixed low level radioactive waste and radioactive byproduct material providing wcs a significant and valuable competitive advantage in this multi billion dollar industry
3505933 in addition this llrw disposal license will allow wcs to provide a significant service in our countrys quest for energy independence in the next 15 to 20 years texas is expected to double its existing power generation capacity to accommodate increased demand and retiring power plants because only 7 of texas current generating capacity comes from nuclear power compared to 20 nationally much of this increased capacity will likely be nuclear generated the llrw generated from this increased capacity will have the disposal capacity needed in texas at wcs
3505934 valhi has sponsored wcs operations and licensing efforts for over 12 years we believe the prospects for this business are extraordinary due to the unique characteristics of the industry and wcs experience and the extensive disposal and treatment capabilities it will be able to provide upon finalization of the llrw disposal license with the continuing strong support for the facility by the citizens of the surrounding area wcs will now be in a position to significantly grow and expand its business

3505956 we are pleased to report that the record revenue that we achieved during the first quarter of this year has now been eclipsed by the second quarter results which posted the largest sales quarter in our companys history at 37 7 million we had set our expectations quite high in terms of sales growth as we entered 2008 and we are certainly encouraged with the momentum achieved through the first half of the year our growth on the top line continues to be fueled by strong demand for our core products in the premium steel golf shaft category which are used in every major golf companys product offerings the strength of the true temper and project x franchises have been clearly demonstrated during the first six months of 2008 as we have seen sales improvement in both our traditional and new products offered under these two flagship brands in addition we delivered another outstanding quarter of revenue gains in our expanding performance sports business with second quarter growth of 75 to follow up the first quarter improvement of 88 our expanding marketshare and product range in the hockey industry has been at the heart of our 2008 revenue improvement in performance sports as we continue to develop a larger and diversified portfolio of performance based recreational products overall we were quite pleased to complete the first half of 2008 with total sales growth of nearly 18 versus the first half of the prior year especially given the generally weak economic backdrop in most domestic consumer goods markets
3505957 the second quarter also marked another significant step forward in true tempers continuing profitability improvement programs our gross profit percentage of 37 for q2 08 represented the highest quarterly level in over two years and by closely managing our sg amp a spending and investments we were able to deliver a 32 improvement in second quarter adjusted ebitda versus the prior year leverage on increased unit sales improved manufacturing efficiencies and reduced affects from commodity inflation all contributed to this overall improvement the strong second quarter results brought our 2008 year to date adjusted ebitda to 20 0 million or 27 of net sales as our cost savings and profitability improvement efforts are clearly bearing fruit
3505958 while we fully anticipate to experience continued sales gains in our business we do expect to see some moderation of the growth rate during the second half of 2008 as we compare it to a very strong back half of 2007 on a year to date basis our golf shaft revenue is up 11 versus the first half of 2007 while the overall golf market has held up quite well in the face of a generally unfavorable economic environment it is certainly not growing at a double digit pace at retail our new products and marketshare initiatives have enabled us to outpace the market during the first half of 2008 and we expect that growth rate to ease during the third and fourth quarters while the golf market in the us has been relatively flat growth in our international markets in japan and throughout asia has remained strong and we expect that to continue during the second half offsetting some of the weakness domestically likewise our performance sports revenue base has expanded significantly during the first half of 2008 far exceeding our goal of 50 annual growth we are anticipating continued sales growth in the performance sports category during the second half but again at a more modest rate overall while we remain somewhat more cautious going into the back half of this year it is certainly clear that 2008 will mark a new annual sales record for true temper sports
3505959 as we assess our profitability forecast for the remainder of 2008 we continue to see strong improvement in both gross profit and adjusted ebitda clearly the third quarter of 2007 represented an unusually challenging period and we expect to make significant year over year gains during this current third quarter in addition we also anticipate further profitability enhancement during the fourth quarter of the year as our manufacturing productivity initiatives continue to pay dividends looking forward into 2009 we believe that a return to our historical gross profit and adjusted ebitda percentages is achievable through continued emphasis on manufacturing efficiencies new product growth pricing and commodities management and our ongoing dedication to cost containment programs
3505960 it is possible to do well in a transaction with a dealer but you have to do your research
3505961 just a half hour of internet research can really pay off
3505962 the biggest mistake people make is in not knowing what their current vehicle is worth when they walk into a dealership
3505963 the key to doing well in a transaction with a dealer is to be knowledgeable
3505964 pretend youre a buyer and look up your kind of trade in vehicle
3505965 look at what other people are asking for your particular kind of car especially in your local area this will give you an understanding of what your market is likely to bear
3505966 the good news is that in the auto industry information is relatively easy to get
3505967 web sites like kelley blue book and edmunds com give you a good view of the market and the information is readily available for free all thats required is time to spend a few minutes online

3505974 in previous cycles people had been drawing off the equity in their homes to supplement their buying power but that is just not an option anymore
3505975 we once went to new york the week before thanksgiving and celebrated with my family then because four tickets for thanksgiving week were just outrageously expensive
3505976 we got some great rates with about a 500 total savings
3505977 you can withdraw tax free all or part of the assets from one traditional ira if you reinvest them within 60 days in the same or another traditional ira because this is a rollover you cannot deduct the amount that you reinvest in an ira
3505978 we did a study that shows a couple aged 65 today would need 225 000 in post tax savings to pay for health care expenses throughout their retirement
3505979 what were supposed to be insuring are the reconstruction costs
3505980 your land is probably worth 10 percent to 15 percent of the purchase price
3505981 the best thing to do is simply figure out what it will cost you to replace your house
3505982 most insurance agents have tools that can help you figure that out but if nothing else find out how much a house would cost by square foot if you have a 200 000 square foot home and its 120 per square foot to replace it well you can do the math
3505983 if you are switching from a co pay plan to an hsa plan it is not at all uncommon to save 40 percent to 50 percent in terms of premiums
3505984 then if you add the tax savings you get if you fully fund your hsa you can get an even bigger number
3505985 there are many clinical studies that are ongoing at the university of tennessee as there are at other universities
3505986 many clinical studies provide care and treatment and follow up at no expense to pet owners while others subsidize the cost of providing the medical care
3505987 owners should find the web site of the nearest veterinary school and look to see which clinic trials are taking place pet owners can also do an online search for information related to research about the specific problem their dog or cat may have
3505988 the community surgery service offers some surgical procedures at reduced cost for owners who are otherwise unable to pay full price
3505989 in order to qualify your animal hospital must be aaha accredited
3505990 the fico 08 scores of legitimate authorized users will now reflect the information on their credit reports about the account s on which they are authorized users
3505991 vantagescore excludes authorized user trade lines whether with good or bad payment histories to ensure the risk assessment of a credit applicant represents the true credit risk of the prospect and not the originating borrower with whom the authorized trade line is associated
3505992 lenders do not have to consider the credit history of spousal authorized users unless the information is available
3505993 the millions and millions of consumers who wouldve seen their scores go down are not going to see that happen
3505994 were seeing all of the programs that have worked in the past coming back
3505995 what this speaks to is a lot of customers are upside down in their current cars
3505996 theres definitely more attention to cars that are more efficient
3505997 the investment firms also face numerous class action lawsuits including four filed by the carey amp danis firm of st louis
3505998 corey sullivan a lawyer at the firm said the cases against ubs citigroup bank of america and wells fargo should benefit from the big dollar regulatory settlements it certainly lends credence to the factual underpinnings of our cases he said

3506000 theres no reason to pay college bookstore prices theres no reason to pay college bookstore prices
3506001 bottom line this is the bush administration shoving science aside to serve its special interest supporters
3506002 the bush administration released a weak owl recovery plan in may that was roundly criticized by independent scientists and now it is using that inadequate plan as justification to remove habitat protections
3506003 protecting critical habitat for spotted owls is essential to their recovery over the long term but it also helps to protect forest ecosystems and the web of life that depends on them
3506004 salmon and myriad other fish and wildlife depend on forest protections already in place in the northwest
3506005 we remain focused on improving our operating efficiencies and reducing costs to decrease net losses
3506006 we also continue to tightly manage our cash position while evaluating strategic growth opportunities that leverage our expertise in wound care management the restructuring actions that we have implemented to date have helped us mitigate the impact of the manufacturing cost rebate we are providing to smith amp nephew
3506007 the second quarter was a watershed period in meeting azures commitment to commercialization
3506008 production began on our balance tm hybrid electric integrated on the ford e450 chassis and orders and revenue are following customers using the vehicle report that it is meeting or exceeding expectations from both a performance and cost metric the balance tm hybrid electric was designed and built to serve the delivery vehicle market niche and all of our indicators including increased sales and growing interest from potential customers suggest that the market is responding favorably
3506009 on july 18 2007 a barrel of oil cost 75 exactly one year later that same barrel cost 131 as a result americans drove 9 6 billion fewer miles in may 2008 compared to may 2007
3506010 most of our commercial customers dont have the option to simply stop driving instead they need transportation to be more economical without sacrificing any performance or dependability our balance tm hybrid electric is a valid solution offering significant economic advantages over conventionally equipped vehicles the second quarter saw our sales and revenue ramp up begin and with increased attention from fleet managers we expect to continue to grow share in the markets we serve
3506011 the bulk trucking operations experienced some reduction in customer demand translating into reduced loads hauled and lower profitability fuel surcharges in the current period increased by 5 1 million or 55 over the prior period this increase in revenue is primarily a cost recovery when prior period one time events described above are considered consolidated net earnings are very similar to 2007 for the current period
3506012 as trimacs management look ahead to the second half of 2008 it foresees the continuation of the current operating environment
3506013 while international attention turns to the olympic games in beijing americares staff and partners on the ground remain fully committed to supporting the recovery efforts and ongoing health care needs in the most affected regions throughout sichuan province
3506014 i have maintained from the first descriptions of the material contained in the daschle letter that the quality appeared to be such that it could be produced only by some group that was involved with a current or former state program in recent years the level of knowledge expertise and experience required and the types of special equipment required to make such quality product takes time and experimentation to develop further the nature of the finished dried product is such that safety equipment and facilities must be used to protect the individuals involved and to shield their clandestine activity from discovery
3506015 you would need a chemist who is familiar with colloidal fumed silica and a material science person to put it all together and then some mechanical engineers to make this work probably some containment people if you dont want to kill anybody you need half a dozen i think really smart people
3506016 the statement should have had a reference an unsupported sentence being cited as fact is uncomfortable to me any statement in a scientific article should be supported by a reference or by documentation
3506017 the scientific facts are clear that danger looms for users of wireless devices those who live in the vicinity of wireless infrastructure and the general public
3506018 it is a mistake to subject the residents of your community to the dangers attendant to the provision of wireless service that goes far beyond your community usage or need
3506019 this really is wonderful news we are honoured and privileged to receive an offer of help to our community from dr carlo
3506020 in my opinion it is inexcusable that the health protection agency are keeping the lid on this vital debate by continuing to say that mobile phones and masts are completely safe when it is clear to many of us who study the scientific reports that we should be far more precautionary in our use of this technology
3506021 i have good reason to believe that they are doing this because the government is currently earning about 20bn per year in tax revenue from mobile communications and they see short term income as more important than long term health of the population
3506022 though decades of economic research suggest men and women are equalizing in the labor market the notion that todays working women are being paid more and treated better than ever before is simply wrong
3506023 while there may be more women holding high power positions today they are still being paid as their counterparts were three decades ago
3506024 there is still some oil production from the caspian and it is being exported through two other routes one is a rail link from baku to batumi
3506025 and the other link one is another pipeline known as the northern route and that is operated by the azerbaijan national company socar from baku to novorossisk
3506026 what has been suspended as a precaution because of the problems in georgia is the production of gas into the pipeline at baku
3506027 but a gas pipeline is high pressure so you can still supply gas out the other end into turkey even though you are not pumping gas into it at baku and there is probably several days of supply still in turkey
3506028 although bp has halted oil shipments along smaller pipelines through georgia as a precaution the quantities of crude oil involved are relatively small and in any case may soon resume if moscows announcement this morning of a halt to proves to be a step towards de escalation
3506029 that is not to say that there are no important ramifications for the oil market from recent events in the caucasus

3506035 i have experienced more than most people will experience in their lifetime
3506036 the operations of many energy partnerships have nothing to do with the price of crude and natural gas they only need to have demand
3506037 midstream partnerships those that operate pipelines or storage and processing facilities segments as well as those that invest in these segments are among the most stable distribution payers
3506038 and more importantly right now theyre among the most stable investments in whats become a treacherous stock market
3506039 whether the broad energy market is up or down these partnerships continue to be all around successes kinder morgan energy partners and kinder morgan management are foundation holdings in our portfolio
3506040 the big runs up and now the big slides in both crude and natural gas havent meant much to either partnership and while the stock prices have inched higher each has been paying out nice pieces of their respective profits
3506041 kinder morgan energy is currently yielding more than 7 and its payout is rising by more than 8 on an average annual basis
3506042 this makes it a particularly desirable investment for those who want to avoid dealing with k 1 forms and those seeking assets for qualified investment accounts such as iras
3506043 production revenue and cash flow all rose to new heights due to increased conventional oil and gas volumes new oil sands production and sales volumes and increased product pricing all of which offset weak results from the refining division
3506044 nu am apucat sa stau cu vlad decat o zi pentru ca a trebuit sa plec la leipzig am tras cu gandul la el in aceasta competitie si am castigat cum voi ajunge acasa ii voi atarna medalia de gat pentru ca i se datoreaza
3506045 cand a plecat spre china i am cerut sa aduca o medalie si pentru fetita pentru ca nu dorim sa facem diferentieri nu si iata ca taticul s a tinut de cuvant nu a fost aur asa cum i am cerut dar pana la urma este bunsi bronzul
3506046 ca orice baiat eram pasionat de sportul rege initial am jucat fotbal insa pentru scurt timp in urma unei accidentari am decis sa renunt un antrenor a venit la scoala la care invatam eram clasa a treia sa selectioneze copii pentru scrima printre norocosi m am numarat si eu parintii m au incurajat sa merg sa practic acest sport nu pentru ca se gandeau ca voi ajunge vreun nume in lume dar li se parea mai potrivit sa mi petrec timpul liber intr o sala decat pe strazi
3506047 visam ca intr o zi sa calc pe urmele idolului meu dartagnan si sa manuiesc sabia ca nimeni altcineva la sydney visul mi s a realizat si am devenit cel mai bun din lume ba chiar medalia de aur cucerita acolo mi a adus si o porecla pe masura dartagnan
3506048 practic se poate spune ca eu l am agatat faceam antrenamente in aceeasi sala si intr o zi prin 1995 mi am luat inima in dinti si l am invitat la un suc de atunci am ramas nedespartiti
3506049 mihai este innebunit dupa vlad si invers cand se intalnesc ei doi nimeni nu mai are voie sa le invadeze universul mananca impreuna se joaca amandoi avem acasa o harta si mihai ii arata in ce tari a fost la concursuri il invata orase este bun pedagog pe cat de dur e pe plansa pe atat de calm e acasa
3506050 anul acesta nu a prea avut timp de familie pe cea mica a vazut o foarte putin ba era la concursuri ba in cantonament a facut atatea sacrificii anul acesta incat aceasta medalie a venit chiar ca o recompensa noi doi am reusit o singura iesire la un restaurant cu putin inainte de a naste eu daca i as spune cuiva cit de rar ne am vazut ma va intreba cum de am facut copilul
3506051 ii dau sfaturi dar nu ma bag foarte des peste el o mustruluiala venita cateodata din partea sotiei este binevenita

3506054 while it has shuttered many of its branch offices in recent months the company is alive and trying to resize to survive said chris ratliff the founders son and managing director of northern pacific mortgage the companys mortgage banking arm
3506055 broker rick hearn who ran the middletown office of investors trust until it closed aug
3506056 hearn said the blame game going on over who is responsible for bad loans all too often settles on brokers he said
3506057 you can qualify a monkey to buy a house but the question is can he afford it
3506058 ratliff said it is painful for the company to part ways with so many people it is necessary given the sharp drop in loan volume from a high in 2005 of 33 million in revenue the company last year generated about 15 million he said this year it is on pace to broker just 6 million to 7 million in home loans he said
3506059 the company had hoped the housing market would turn around this summer but ratliff said by spring he realized that wasnt going to happen he now doesnt expect a turnaround in the market until spring of 2010
3506060 prime loans are just the latest class of mortgages to suffer a spike in failure rates the first lot to go bad was of course subprime mortgages whose problems set the housing meltdown in motion next were the alt a loans a class between prime and subprime loans that doesnt require strict documentation of a borrowers assets or income
3506061 now as prime loans are added to the mix the resulting foreclosures could haunt the housing market for a long time according to global insights patrick newport
3506062 washington mutual ceo kerry killinger said last month that the banks prime loan delinquencies are on the rise
3506063 also last month jp morgan chase ceo jaime dimon called prime mortgage performance
3506064 the delinquency rate for prime mortgages worth less than 417 000 was 2 44 in may compared with 1 38 a year earlier according to loanperformance
3506065 delinquencies jumped even more for prime loans of more than 417 000 so called jumbo loans they rose to 4 03 of outstanding loans in may compared with 1 11 a year earlier

3506070 windsor added that since he believes the problem to be embedded within the chipset itself its unlikely that apple can rectify the issue through software updates
3506071 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies
3506072 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3506073 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3506074 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3506075 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3506076 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3506077 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3506078 in washington d c all calls were dropped after a second or two
3506079 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3506080 in response to an increase in charges of religious discrimination increased religious diversity in the united states and requests for guidance from stakeholders and agency personnel investigating and litigating claims of religious discrimination
3506081 if the hospital employing a person who has been performing surgery learns that the employee falsified his or her qualifications and never went to medical school that employee could not establish a prima facie mixed motive case irrespective of allegations of racial or ethnic discrimination
3506082 we have made important progress in the last six months to preserve the long term sustainable profitability of our company while working through a process to ensure fair and equitable consideration for all stakeholders
3506083 since january we successfully signed new agreements with many of our customers whose work was due to be renewed despite a challenging economic environment and the unfavourable perception created by our filing
3506084 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more
3506085 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3506086 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees
3506087 in this time of economic uncertainty that would not be a popular outcome for wall street
3506088 ability to enter into romantic relationships has been crippled indefinitely and perhaps permanently
3506089 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3506090 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3506091 lo spettacolo non un insieme di immagini ma un rapporto sociale fra individui mediato dalle immagini
3506092 lo spettacolo il capitale ad un tale grado di accumulazione da divenire immagine
3506093 tutta la vita delle societ moderne in cui predominano le condizioni attuali di produzione si presenta come unimmensa accumulazione di merci
3506094 its notable that suddenly with output rising opec officials are concerned about adherence to quotas and oversupply
3506095 however as we look toward the fourth quarter of the year barring a more significant decline in demand the world is going to need opec oil to avoid a larger inventory draw than is normal for the fourth quarter pulling inventories at that rate would be very bullish for prices
3506096 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3506097 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3506098 old stuff which is much better than the new stuff
3506099 remember that record you bought just yesterday well youre gonna want to buy it again
3506100 is processing gas at pre incident volumes with full extraction and fractionation capabilities
3506101 the recent incident will not delay any of the initiatives which include consolidating a gas plant in the carstairs area of southern alberta commissioning additional gathering systems and efficiency enhancements to increase volumes and boost reliability
3506102 we are extremely excited about these two new brunswick properties as they will give us both the ability to bid on any future request for renewable energy proposals by new brunswick power and the ability to build generation for export to the northeastern u s
3506103 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3506104 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up
3506105 we asked to put an announcement in the newspaper its bizarre
3506106 do you think hed go forward if target wasnt on board
3506107 shops must find niche focus on basics to make it
3506108 we create a custom blend of shampoo for each dog based on the skin condition and whether the dog has been on the beach or in the woods were the experts on helping with a dogs coat and condition
3506109 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3506110 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3506111 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3506112 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3506113 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3506114 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3506115 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3506116 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3506117 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3506118 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3506119 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3506120 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3506121 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3506122 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3506123 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3506124 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3506125 kami melihat betapa kompetitifnya motor dan ban bridgestone kami dan hal ini sangat menggembirakan untuk musim ini

3506127 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3506128 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3506129 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3506130 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3506131 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3506132 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3506133 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3506134 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3506135 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3506136 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3506137 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3506138 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3506148 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3506149 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3506150 almost all of the attacks are broadly and globally sourced one attack appears to be very narrowly focused possibly someone with some basic ping flood scripts
3506151 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3506152 we therefore recommend to the software updates from apple in the eye this you get through itunes
3506153 we advise customers to keep an eye on apples software updates

3506168 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3506169 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3506170 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3506171 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3506172 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3506173 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3506174 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3506175 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3506183 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3506184 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3506185 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3506186 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3506187 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3506188 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3506193 when i was little the 1996 team with the magnificent seven were just amazing to watch and as a little girl it made me aspire to do that
3506194 the first olympics i remember watching were in atlanta in 1996
3506195 i was already involved with gymnastics then but it inspired me to keep working hard to hopefully get to that level because the girls were so amazing to watch
3506196 for me personally dominique dawes was an inspiration because she is african american
3506197 to see her get to that level was amazing and added to my goals
3506198 in 2000 at sydney australia tasha schwikert was an alternate for the u s team and was put on the team at the last minute
3506199 she did an awesome job hit all her routines and was really exciting to watch
3506200 i watched sunday night and it was exciting to watch them
3506201 it motivates me to get in the gym and work hard it gives me the drive to do well after watching them perform their skills so well
3506202 whenever i watch gymnastics it makes me want to get into the gym and makes me excited i will always follow the olympics because it is amazing to see that level of gymnastics it is really exciting to see all the different routines
3506203 i definitely think with all the people watching the olympics it increases interest

3506208 usually when you finish something you let it sit for a couple of days and then look at it early last week we read through the script and we not only liked the new work we saw how much it needed a new title
3506209 the song bounce is no longer in the show but the tune is
3506210 its slightly amended and it has different lyrics i utilized the tune with some variations and a new lyric
3506211 two divergent aspects of american energy the builder and the squanderer the visionary and the promoter the conformist and the maverick the idealistic planner and the restless cynic the one who uses things and the one who uses them up
3506212 this is closer to what we started with than anything weve done since
3506213 there was always a road image the boys start off with their pioneer father on his death bed telling them to follow the road of their dreams
3506214 in fact there is an actual road in the climax of the show an extraordinary road designed by addison and given wilsons promotional push that would lead into boca raton from the outside world 16 lanes wide this in a day with very few automobiles motorized gondolas palm trees bands
3506215 the whole idea of the road has persisted so when john and i got finished with our final tweaks we realized we needed a title that reflected the journeys of the show
3506216 a lot of people will think im sure that we just cant make up our minds thats why we keep changing titles it is quite the reverse in fact its knowing exactly what we think the show is about and i think a title is to inform an audience if an audience comes to a show called bounce and thats not what its about and theres no song called bounce it seems to me extremely misleading thats why were calling it road show and there wont be a title tune it describes to an audience what theyre going to see it also suggests the loose structure of the piece
3506217 out of sams version id say half the songs are still in the show and a number of songs from this last version
3506218 from this last version from bounce theres one song that has been rewritten for another spot and theres the opening number which has very much the same tune but entirely different lyrics you could call those hold overs otherwise id guess without going through the scorecard there are more songs from the sam mendes but its actually an amalgam of the two as well as a couple of new numbers or actually a couple of ones written before sams version
3506219 the fast paced and fascinating story of what happened both in front of the cameras and behind the scenes of one of the most watched television news interviews in history
3506220 though their desmet south dakota farmstead comes with many new challenges the ingalls family perseveres through the hardships of pioneer life to find hope love and the promise of a new beginning in a land of endless sky and open prairie as laura struggles to overcome a lifelong loathing of school and frequent battles with a town rival her older sisters sudden blindness and a harsh winter blizzard test the independent spirit of this young pioneer forced to grow up quickly she follows an unexpected calling and finding love on the prairie
3506221 there is no question that these two musicals play legitimate roles in the classical theatre repertoire and i am very proud that we are producing them side by side
3506222 is a wonderfully irreverent musical that combines aspects of the 2 000 year old comedies of the roman playwright plautus with classic vaudeville humor
3506223 forum which features the hit song comedy tonight is the story of pseudolus a slave in ancient rome who will do anything to win his freedom with book by and larry gelbart it is the first broadway musical for which stephen sondheim wrote both music and lyrics

3506229 has celebrated the artistic expressiveness of with the highest standards of professional theatre
3506230 the coins that eight year old noah carelessly leaves behind in his pockets are more than just spare change to caroline thibodeax an laundry room in louisiana in 1963
3506231 blending blues gospel and traditional jewish melodies in a breathtaking score this deeply personal story from pulitzer prize winner tony kushner is drawn from the playwrights own childhood
3506232 currently working on a history of baseball in new york city
3506233 was not a great leadoff man and had a pretty bad arm as a centerfielder but somehow he would just make things happen he gets the key hit he hands the bat to bucky dent in 78 playoff game against the red sox
3506234 i was at a game that same year when he hit a ball to right field the detroit tigers mickey stanley went back to get it and he couldnt make the catch he claimed a fan interfered with it and stood there on the field this veteran outfielder arguing with the umpire rivers went all the way around the bases there was always something like that
3506235 it varies a lot in some cases i was picking actual figures such as moses chief
3506236 it was much less cheesy than all the endless baseball fiction books written about the new york mammoths or the new york gothams i picked them in part because they were the hot team in new york when i was writing the book they qualify as public figures
3506237 i think if i had to do it again i would have done it as a historical novel from that period i just wanted to do a novel based all these stories in a way its a compilation of baseball myths and stories drawn from all over the place
3506238 it would be easier for me to write about harlem in that period than to write about harlem today
3506239 paradise alley was tremendous fun to do the thing about writing historical novels is you have to question every single thing you cant just have someone walk into a room and turn on a light its a continuous process of discovery about how people used to live
3506240 im not overly concerned about whether it rained on a certain day or what time the ferry boat left
3506241 the little things that tell you the nature of the society in paradise alley for instance something that really struck me was about how the sewers were in such terrible condition at that point the butchers were all so free about pushing their offal into the sewers that whenever there was the slightest rain the gutters would run with blood it was very common to see young boys sailing paper boats in these gutters of blood
3506242 theres such a wealth of information fascinating stuff about new york life and the game for instance how inundated it was with gambling even before 1919 i was amazed to find that john mcgraw owned a pool hall with arnold rothstein
3506243 its very true and its one of things that happen because they dont really fact check books
3506244 they dont have the resources to do so and have no intention in trying to do it so there is that problem
3506245 when i was researching eight men out recently the chronology of the black sox scandal eliot asinof has all kinds of things wrong he has the white sox plotting the fix in the ansonia hotel in new york on a day they were in boston it would be very hard for publishers to get everything right
3506246 i find the sources on the internet to still be too scattered to be worth my while for the most part though its something im starting to do a little more
3506247 for the most part for dreamland and paradise alley i relied on books i find 19th century newspapers a real pain to look through for every kernel of something interesting you find theres an awful lot of hacking through peoples wild digressions and opinions and their own disinformation
3506248 there were terrific books but also i found a lot of good newspapers sources such as the amsterdam news
3506249 the information is sourced and you dont run into some of the crazy things that you might find on wikipedia
3506250 the way one goes about it now is just so time consuming much more than a library you type in a word or two into google and you get 5 000 entries which you then have to go through one by one to find the best source
3506251 for quick things that arent that important to the main narrative for instance for the baseball book i wanted to find a little bit of information about the newark peppers who were the federal league team that lasted for a year this wasnt something i was going to devote more than a paragraph to but i was able to look it up fairly quickly on the internet and find a wonderful source
3506252 its probably made me more likely to re write and to edit deeper id like to think i was such a devoted artist i was dong it before but it probably has which is a tremendously good thing
3506253 natural phenomena in the universe accelerate particles to higher energies than possible with any man made particle accelerator on earth
3506254 this instrument provides the opportunity to see universe through a powerful new window that will allow us to better understand what these astrophysical phenomena are how they work and what happens when very high energy particles interact with matter
3506255 personally i dont see myself as an aggressive person but people have attached a menace to the stillness i have on stage
3506256 i used to go round to his house in hanover terrace
3506257 i had that irritating habit of just turning up which i suppose is a working class thing
3506258 these corrections help to keep the beams focused and colliding recreating thousands of times a second the conditions that existed just after the big bang
3506259 its successful demonstration at rhic provides an alternative path to the goal of increased collision rates which would be much more costly and take longer to achieve via other proposed means
3506260 this achievement would compare quite favorably with the goals of our original plan for upgrading collision rates based on a system known as electron cooling which we estimate would have cost 95 million

3506310 would really provide the first confirmation in this very profound way we might think about nature
3506311 when i figured out how to do that for myself i just thought it was just the coolest thing that little old me scratching away on my piece of paper could figure this out
3506312 from about 13 or 14 i knew that this is what i wanted to do
3506313 as always i wont say much about repertoire until the album is well into post production but i will say that the album was inspired by a road trip philip and i took in may of 2006 from new york to savannah we were tossing around ideas for his next album during the drive south then while in savannah we took a carriage tour that stopped at johnny mercers gravesite and i guess the idea for the album and the feel sort of crystallized there as the title suggests it takes its cue from philips southern roots but in unexpected ways it took us a couple years after that road trip to figure out exactly how to say what we wanted to say and as always happens when philip and i work on an album the repertoire is a mix of the known and the little known the theatre songs include selections by harold arlen johnny mercer tracks

3506319 milky rainfall in grant and catron counties coated cars and homes with a mysterious white residue scientists at the university of texas at el paso report that theyre zeroing in on the cause

3506321 if i had to make a bet id put my money on playa dust gilbert said noting that test results are still prelimi nary
3506322 i suspect dust particles quite literally seeded the cloud and precipitated out as rain gill said
3506323 previously identified as a major source of particles in the atmosphere he said but never before associated with white rain
3506324 certainly much more likely as a source than a volcano from much farther away
3506325 buzz on the internet over silver citys strange rain has also brought out reports from eastern new mexico that white rainfall probably picked up from the gypsum dust of white sands occurs in that region gill said
3506326 an unusual event research on the in ternet has turned up similar accounts gill said
3506327 milky rain turned up a scientific study of an event in south africa with
3506328 read ing the report from south africa helps us to perform the same tests and gives us an idea of how milky rain storms get started unexplainedon february 7 2008 at 5 31 am
3506329 the likelihood is that the particle will show up pretty quickly im more than 90 percent certain that it will
3506330 it all happens so fast that the appearance of the boson may be hidden in the data collected and it could take a long time for the analysis to find it

3506530 during these two years i was led to think much about religion by further reflecting that the clearest evidence would be requisite to make any sane man believe in the miracles by which christianity is supported that the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible do miracles become that the men at that time were ignorant and credulous to a degree almost incomprehensible by us that the gospels cannot be proved to have been written simultaneously with the events that they differ in many important details far too important as it seemed to me to be admitted as the usual inaccuracies of eyewitnesses by such reflections as these which i give not as having the least novelty or value but as they influenced me i gradually came to disbelieve in christianity as a divine revelation but i was very unwilling to give up my belief i feel sure of this for i can well remember often and often inventing day dreams of manuscripts being discovered at pompeii or elsewhere which confirmed in the most striking manner all that was written in the gospels but i found it more and more difficult with free scope given to my imagination to invent evidence which would suffice to convince me thus disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate but was at least complete the rate was so slow that i felt no distress and have never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion was correct

3506536 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3506560 we are still friends we are just trying to give each other some space i will always love him this is a hard time for both of us
3506561 i thought being alone again was going to suck i think that is what kept me from breaking up a lot sooner
3506562 i am finding a new sense of freedom and empowerment it sounds corny but i feel like i can do anything i dont need to have someone in my life to make me feel complete

3506571 one poster stinking up the joint isnt the end of the world yet it sends the wrong message about our movie and i just wanted you to know that i feel the pain
3506572 we had this relationship before mtv so there was a place of can we put this behind us i believe in who you are do you still believe in who i am we have something bigger than the show
3506573 businesswise it was definitely in my best interest to take the challenge to move forward and put it behind me
3506574 i said no chairs and no entourage there were no chairs except the ones we were sitting on and there was no entourage

3506577 there wasnt a period in my life like serena went through where i was doing drugs and having sex with my best friends boyfriend i never went through that kind of crazy
3506578 ive kissed just three people in my life other than stuff that ive done for tv or movies
3506579 its amazing that this has been kept under wraps for so long considering youre up against the electronic media but it looks as if the film bosses have won a major battle in keeping cruise on camera a top secret this time
3506580 it wasnt like its some mysterious story about some unfinished album that was in some closet for 10 years we finished the album the best that we could when i was 16 we had all the intentions in the world to get it out there and get a record deal with it
3506581 when nothing happened the recordings kind of just disappeared and about two years ago dave my producer and girlfriend drea de matteo both were like youve got to do something with that
3506582 thank you to modern technology it doesnt sound like we dug up some vocals that had always been there and we had to do magic to make it sound new its all about bringing my musical side of everything i do around him and creating this completely different but acceptable space that he fits in

3506633 if you look at the warm centuries with a global perspective the wide incidence of drought is truly striking and offers a sobering message about tomorrows world prolonged aridity was widespread in medieval times and killed enormous numbers of people evidence is mounting that drought is the silent and insidious killer associated with global warming

3506662 and when i was about 5 this little boy who was ill wanted to ride a motorbike and they got this little tiny honda monkey bike as it was called and the kid rode it all around the field i was there so i asked if i could have a shot afterwards and i think its true to say i never got over the feeling of going like that on the bike its a thrill that i still have to this day

3506666 lloyd has an annoying quality about him in the sound version he is not the harold we know
3506667 if you look closely at many of the press releases from over the long period of time this film was gestating he kept changing his mind whether to make it a silent or sound film he kept changing the title he changed casts twice
3506668 but some of it was incomplete the first reel was missing entirely but there was also a dupe picture negative so we were able to use that for the first reel and other segments
3506669 as he gets more comfortable in the system he starts to settle and get in a groove he was third string but he kept pushing and pushing staying ready five weeks into the season he was our starter
3506670 on tuesdays last season we were getting after the scout team pretty good
3506671 he can move the pocket hes good enough to flick the ball around and find guys any time you have a quarterback who can move it around thats a problem for you as a defense
3506672 its hard because his instincts are to go out be a playmaker like going out on a fastbreak rather running set offense
3506673 he has to get his eyes down the field his eyes are still too much looking at the blocking i think craft is further along in that regard

3506712 denver has urban hospitals that are on many different blocks theyre sprawled over many different streets they dont control the access to their property the way suburban hospitals do
3506713 i think were all idiots for smoking anyway because were in the health profession and we know what it does to people and maybe its just going to be a booster for us to stop smoking
3506714 we dont have the luxury in the city of expanding into the open field next door our hospitals have kind of grown organically and theyve taken over buildings and they jump streets and blocks and they need a little help from us
3506715 they should have a balance they shouldnt allow smoking on the site itself but i think they need to have a designated area off site
3506716 ive practiced a lot of times stopping maybe this will be it

3506722 careful examination of scripture and a thorough knowledge of history
3506723 the anglican communion has no peculiar thought practice creed or confession of its own it has only the catholic faith of the ancient catholic church as preserved in the catholic creeds and maintained in the catholic and apostolic constitution o f christs church from the beginning
3506724 anglicans to cede the illusion of spiritual authority as something we hold independent of christ and his entire body broken as it is it is a call to not limit our thinking of our governance to the extent that our synods and courts can adjudicate
3506725 in this faith which i do unfeignedly and wholly believe as a true member of christs catholic church do i purpose to finish my life
3506726 tend to be aesthetic protestant tendencies as opposed to fundamentally non catholic intrinsics
3506727 t he purpose of the oxford movement was not to make the church of england catholic but to make it recognize that it has always been catholic the church of england is not the fullness of the church catholic but that it is still a part of it and whilst you sometimes have to look for them the marks of catholicism a re there
3506728 but meanwhile the ground had to be prepared by bringing back to en glish churchmen all those catholic doctrines and practices which had been lost or obscured during those 400 years of babylonish captivity all that was lost restore that was the prayer and the aim of the fathers of the oxford movement newman in tract xc 1841 had shown that the thirty nine articles properly understood were in no way inconsistent with the teaching of the council of trent his contention was supported by dr pusey in his eirenicon 1865 and by bishop forbes of brechin in treatise on the articles 1867 there was indeed nothing very new in this for the same assertion has been made 200 years earlier by the learned franciscan dr christopher devonport known as sancta clara in his book the articles of the anglican church considered and explained published in 1646 the translation of the image o l w 1931 but this restoration of catholic doctrine and practice only made its way gradually and with varying degrees of emphasis the eucharistic revival came first in point of time and of public attention and along with the restoration of the doctrine and practice of confession the great battles of the latter half of the nineteenth century during which priests suffered imprisonment were concerned almost exclusively with these but the most momentous event of this period was the restoration of the religious life just as the dissolution of the monasteries and the destruction of religious life had been the prelude to the suppression of catholic faith and practice in the church of england so the restoration of the religious life was the prelude to its revival this revival of the religious life in anglican soil is one of the most striking proofs that the church of england in spite of her disastrous separation from the centre of christendom is still a living part of the mystical body of christ

3506734 pregnant victim was repeatedly thrown to the ground and spit on
3506735 the community cant place their full confidence in that kind of inquiry
3506736 a significant number of the pregnancies especially among the younger students were the result of deliberate and intentional behaviour
3506737 when you live here theres nothing to do but have babies
3506738 its not all cute things like dressing up your baby
3506739 we have to be equally strong in sending a message preventing future teen pregnancy and about how raising children and having children is an adult activity
3506740 carl is a great example of how our volunteers help this organization succeed
3506741 i read somewhere that people who volunteer live four to six years longer volunteering is probably the most heartwarming healthy thing you can do it brings a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment
3506742 we could see that in homes of seniors many needed more than just simple repairs they needed safety items there was much more that we could do than we were doing through the rebuilding events
3506743 i knew that i wanted to help seniors because thats what i was plenty of people volunteer but often the senior population is ignored in our culture somewhere while people were volunteering elsewhere a senior was sitting at home with a broken door but couldnt get up to fix it once i realized that i knew this is where i wanted to put my time
3506744 you have to make that commitment and volunteers who are serious about their work would probably say this is the best experience theyve had in their life
3506745 i started making jam because i couldnt find any that i liked then i would sell it to people for donations to rebuilding together weve raised 10 000 with the jam
3506746 were providing an outlet for their energy people have to have a purpose in life and volunteering for this organization gives people a reason to get up in the morning
3506747 because of their committed service were able to carry out our mission and help more people in our community to live in greater comfort safety and independence

3506755 claro urge un gol a m tambi n me gustar a meter gol lo he buscado pero no lo he podido meter pero lo importante es que el equipo comience a funcionar bien y qu mejor que sea ma ana el delantero se ocupa de hacer goles eso da mucha confianza y ojal pueda caer ma ana
3506756 sabemos que siempre toluca en su cancha es un rival muy dif cil pero estamos bien con mucha confianza y sabiendo que tenemos que ganar y ma ana es una buena oportunidad para conseguir la primera victoria
3506757 la idea es la misma obviamente no s qui nes son los once que jugar n ma ana pero la idea es la misma que es tener un equipo din mico eso s estar bien parados para conseguir el cero en nuestra porter a y al frente buscar hacer da o a la defensa de toluca
3506758 de los rivales que nos pod an haber tocado el hadjuk es uno de los m s complicados pero en teor a la liga espa ola es mucho m s importante que la croata y somos favoritos aunque eso hay que demostrarlo en el campo
3506759 todos deseamos estar en el once y es el entrenador el que decide a m por supuesto que me encantar a desde que llegu al equipo he ido superando fases entr en las convocatorias jugu amistosos y si ahora llega el debut oficial estar muy ilusionado por vestir la camiseta del deportivo
3506760 no tir ninguna patada simplemente llegu y trat de quitarle el bal n
3506761 me causa una impresi n muy mala porque en ning n momento fue agresi n en la cancha se lo dije al rbitro que no hab a escuchado cuando pit no tir ninguna patada simplemente llegu y trat de quitarle el bal n
3506762 habl con el entrenador son cosas que se quedan entre nosotros ahorita le coment que no escuch cuando pit despu s fui con lobos lucas y le dije que no escuch nada que no le hab a pegado me dijo que no hab a problema que l no hab a sentido ning n golpe ni modo si me toca ir a la primera a lo har como profesional como trabajador de esta instituci n
3506763 the more confident everyone gets the more energy there is things were slow at first but there is steady progression every day we practice
3506764 with the team now getting to practice with full pads guys are having fun and are excited to go to practice everyday
3506765 i dont really feel any pressure we have a great defense and im surrounded by great guys that makes it real easy to just go out and have fun playing football
3506766 i thought it went pretty well weve been getting these practices cut short weve been chased by lightning pretty regularly i thought it was real smooth everybody was ready to start playing real football instead again we did very little live work were blocking live but we are not tackling to the ground just yet were easing into that well do a little bit more as each practice comes i was just real pleased with the progress and real pleased with the tempo of practice
3506767 overall in conditioning i think we are in great shape the kids have really responded to everything that we want that they got a great attitude they are starting to bond as a team becoming a unit as we go deeper into preseason
3506768 ahora el compromiso es mayor porque la ilusi n de la afici n es m s grande
3506769 el mexicano tendr que enfrentarse a un sinf n de desaf os en una lucha desmedida y desigual por tratar de rescatar un balompi nacional carente de elementos b sicos para su desarrollo tambi n tendr que luchar con la idiosincracia de los salvadore os el recuerdo de dos mundiales que pesan y 24 a os de fracasos y decepciones
3506770 me siento muy contento las cosas van marchando bien esperando que las cosas vayan mejorando sabiendo que no ha sido f cil para m el trabajo porque no hemos tenido todos los apoyos y las condiciones reales
3506771 estamos satisfechos con lo realizado porque vamos mejorando y estamos instalados en una etapa bien importante que es el cuadrangular y con m ritos propios porque los muchachos han ido asimilando la idea y creyendo en lo que uno les propone
3506772 mucha gente nos daban pocas posibilidades de poder superar esa etapa porque en la realidad pananam ha sido m s fuerte en los ltimos a os y ha estado mejor que el salvador
3506773 entonces el hecho de haberlos superado y de manera convincente nos tiene muy contentos y en lo personal muy motivado pero con el compromiso y la responsabilidad mayor y como pudimos dar este paso la gente est muy ilusionada y tiene la esperanza de que podamos llegan hasta el hexagonal
3506774 los muchachos se han convencido de que tienen capacidad y habilidad el trabajo en equipo ha sido fundamental
3506775 est n convencidos de que no tenemos estrellas jugadores distintos o que hagan mucha diferencia simplemente han etendido que para poder lograr sacar un buen resultado en cualquier partido siempre se necesita pensar y trabajar en equipo
3506776 la gente habla de que es un grupo menos complejo pero me voy a enfrentar a uno de los tres mejores equipos de la zona que es costa rica despu s de m xico y estados unidos y al campe n del caribe que es hait y a un equipo como surinam que ha dado grandes jugadores y en el ranking de la fifa est mejor que los salvadore os
3506777 como todo mundo tenemos derecho a so ar aunque nuestros sue os se ven m s lejanos que otros pa ses como m xico y estados unidos costa rica y honduras pero el hecho de que nuestra selecci n en este momento est jugando bien y no hemos conseguido los resultados por suerte y fortuna sino por jugar bien al futbol
3506778 la meta que me trac es llegar al hexagonal porque el llegar al hexagonal considero hablar a bien del trabajo que estamos realizando
3506779 la selecci n tiene una caracter stica muy particular que es buen juego colectivo no s lamente es la garra salvadore a que siempre mostr sino que es un equipo que trata bien la pelota y eso entusiasma a la gente
3506780 por eso la afici n a ora esos tiempos que quiere volver a vivir entonces por eso la ilusi n es muy grande y para m representa todav a un compromiso mayor porque la gente est esperando eso
3506781 es un equipo ordenado que juega bien la pelota que tiene un buen juego colectivo eso es lo que nos ha hecho crecer
3506782 they have some good players especially their three up top theyre strong and fast and theyre going to create goal scoring opportunities
3506783 you always want to play the game that they dont like
3506784 when you play teams who like to keep the ball you have to keep the ball when you play teams who like to play physically you play them physically if a team likes to attack well lets see how they are defensively
3506785 nigeria are a team that can beat you in a lot of different ways and have quite a bit of pace
3506786 we have to make sure we play smart and that our shape is good and probably figure some things out on the fly
3506787 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3506788 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3506789 it doesnt get any easier seeing them lift the trophy that we made ours when jose mourinho first took over
3506790 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from united when they were at the very top of their game
3506791 with it being that close in the premier league and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money
3506792 i think we can close the gap because man utd were at the very top of their game last season
3506793 but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3506794 we want it back and thats what we aiming for we have to move on from last year
3506795 we were the nearly team last year almost won the carling cup almost won the champions league almost won the premier league
3506796 we were very close but at the end of the day we werent good enough and we need to raise the bar
3506797 yo sinceramente no s porque baila hoy karina y no baila el pr ximo ritmo yo las galas que falt fue porque me romp un hueso
3506798 yo se le creo primero porque vi el golpe y porque a mi no me da la cabeza para hacer semejante show lo nico que me parece raro es que baile hoy y no el jive que es tan dif cil
3506799 me parece que le caiga mejor alguien que cambi de coach de so ador y de todo
3506800 aunque hubiera estado en muletas iba a bailar igual porque quer a terminar lo que empec
3506801 no me gusta la idea de que gente se cuelgue de esta situaci n para salir en los medios
3506802 yo ten a una buena relaci n con ella no s que le pas
3506803 yo trabajo con el cuerpo y la cara no me voy a andar tirando as al suelo
3506804 yo ped permiso y la producci n me lo dio debe ser por algo no s en una de esas me lo merezco porque bail con tendinitis con todo y necesitaba un descanso
3506805 como ellos sab an que yo estaba bien f sicamente decidieron hacer eso y bueno qu voy a hacer no me voy a enojar
3506806 estoy re contenta con este reemplazo s que me va a cuidar el lugar y no me va a robar el lugar
3506807 lucas esta de viaje en espa a cumpliendo con un compromiso de trabajo
3506808 todos tenemos problemas personales que no los quiero contar porque no quiero llevar m s preocupaci n a la gente
3506809 primero esta la familia la salud y despu s el trabajo
3506810 es normal que alguien se desmaye o le baje la presi n no s porque tienen que hablar as sobre ello

3506814 die sicherheit der russischen friedenssoldaten und der russischen staatsb rger ist gew hrleistet
3506815 aus dem russischen blickwinkel ist das eine regional begrenzte milit rische operation mit berregionaler politischer wirkung
3506816 die russen wollten bereits seit langem ihre s dlichen grenzen sichern
3506817 und ich denke wir haben den rger moskaus ber das wachsende engagement der nato in russlands hinterhof untersch tzt
3506818 russland will einen regimewechsel aber bisher nicht mit milit rischen mitteln
3506819 sie haben nur milit rische ziele angegriffen was zeigt dass sie die regierung nicht milit risch st rzen wollen aber sicher f nden sie es besser wenn saakaschwili ersetzt w rde
3506820 russland wollte eine lektion erteilen und zwar nicht nur den georgiern
3506821 international m sste moskau dann mit einer weitreichenden verschlechterung der beziehungen rechnen deswegen haben sie sich darauf beschr nkt saakaschwili vor der ganzen welt zu dem tigen
3506822 russland hat dieses spiel gewonnen auch deshalb weil sie den krieg so kurz halten konnten
3506823 russland m chte sicherstellen dass georgien niemals der nato beitritt

3506825 toluca era bastante dif cil y cuando nos fuimos abajo demostramos las ganas que tenemos de salir adelante de querer ganar cada partido creo que justamente se nos dio y ahora hay que mantener esa mentalidad y esa racha para hacer un buen partido el domingo
3506826 siete puntos de nueve son muy buenos ahora hay que seguir trabajando durante la semana para seguir en esa buena senda en la que estamos me he sentido bastante bien creo que ya super el tema de la altura me he sentido en el equipo bastante bien este domingo fue una prueba muy dif cil ante toluca se meti todo atr s y pudimos revertir
3506827 fue bastante duro no s lo con l sino con toluca un equipo que se vuelca atr s que se fue al frente muy temprano pero tuvimos la ambici n de ganar y se nos dio no hicimos un gran partido tambi n por lo que hizo toluca en la cancha pero ganamos que era lo importante
3506828 its just heartbreaking to see so many of these horses coming in in this condition
3506829 feed prices are going up gas prices are going up everything is going up
3506830 youre getting your first time owners thats never had a horse going and buying a horse and then not knowing what to do with it how to care for it
3506831 horses are expensive to keep compared to small animals so they usually hurt first and worst
3506832 claro que s hay prima doble y el partido ante chivas es prima doble y hay centenarios tambi n centenarios a los que metan goles y al mejor jugador del partido y esos son incentivos que les damos a los muchachos y es l gico esos nos los dan uno de los patrocinadores y esos son incentivos para los muchachos es una motivaci n extra el poder decir me gan el centenario del partido y para ellos es algo extra y estoy confiado y les reitero a mi equipo todo mi apoyo mi confianza y amistad
3506833 viene un partido importante y no s lo porque el estadio estar lleno porque todos queremos ganarle a chivas sino tambi n para las aspiraciones del equipo por ah empezamos un poquito dormilones pero contra ju rez el equipo tom confianza y por eso creo que ser importante para seguir adelante y que los muchachos sigan concentrados con mentalidad de ganar por eso ser important simo el partido ante chivas
3506834 todav a les falta un poquito pero los vimos muy ordenados atr s lamentable fue la expulsi n de quatrocci pero ste es el equipo que me gustar a ver con rodallega rompi ndola metiendo dos goles con everaldo funcionando y el equipo bastante bien con los j venes muy aplicados pero a n nos falta un poquito es cuesti n de tiempo y de trabajo
3506835 un 70 por ciento de las personas de aqu la van a las chivas y bueno ellos han perdido dos veces este a o con nosotros en la presentaci n de nuestro equipo en el estadio el 9 de enero despu s perdieron el 30 de marzo aqu y vienen con todo a tratar de sacarse la espina no me confiar a al contrario hay que salir con todo a ganar vamos a salir a hacer lo nuestro

3506839 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3506840 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3506841 if youre not involved in the sport im not sure you can fully appreciate it
3506842 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3506843 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3506844 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3506845 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3506846 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning
3506847 ah e tal foi o outro logotipo que ganhou a vota o mas que isto

3506852 the last time i saw him he was dead but hes got to be around here somewhere
3506853 it hit me when i was given the medal of honor over at the ellis island thing you know because my parents came over from italy although i was born here in new haven connecticut but you know i took it upon myself to speak that day about the people that were around me generals admirals police chiefs everything that you could possibly imagine all from different parts of the world who have come to this country to make this great country and people forget that you know people forget that they came from people from the other side you know its an amazing country people just dont realize how wonderful this place is and they just take it as a lock and oh yes i deserve this you dont deserve anything youve got to prove that youre a good american by being an american thats what i feel anyway

3506856 it is a golden opportunity for taiwan not just to make money
3506857 blind everyone with dreams of lucre and avarice exploit peoples selfish short sighted desires for comfort and maybe they wont notice or care about such little things as national security etc im horrified to report that some of this is
3506858 you will have mainlanders in taiwan and taiwanese on the mainland a very close interrelationship i dont see you could start a war like that this is the best national defense

3506865 we need to know what we got before we decide if we are going to use it
3506866 you dont need much change in supply to change oil prices
3506867 you cant force companies to drill where its not economically feasible
3506868 we have a number of cases that we are looking at and we are unable to be specific at this point
3506869 we confiscated a number of items including paperwork and photographs from the ranch and we are continuing to use those in our investigation
3506870 i can be in the outfield and play every day i dont want to dh
3506871 i dont feel like a baseball player when i dh i dont know how to be the leader that i am from the bench i cant be a vocal leader i cant talk to guys from the bench because i dont feel right about it
3506872 im in a role now where i dont know what to do really the guys are out there busting their butt for nine innings they come in and they hit and they grind i just sit down and hit thats all i do so i cant be in a leadership role from that position
3506873 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3506874 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3506875 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3506876 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3506877 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3506878 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3506879 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3506880 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3506881 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3506882 if hes found out he doesnt like it well thats the only role we have for him at this time
3506883 he has not shown from a health perspective that hes been able to play every day in the outfield he just has to perform the task thats asked of him
3506884 im sure hes frustrated because injuries have not enabled him to do what hes done in the past
3506885 i totally understand that hes a potential hall of fame guy and ive always told him to say what he feels just remember that everyone doesnt agree with it

3506931 it makes no sense for american taxpayers to keep paying for reconstruction projects in iraq when iraq has a large budget surplus and is capable of paying for its own projects iraq doesnt need the money but we do
3506932 iraq is making big profits on its oil sales and were still paying the bill for their reconstruction projects that makes no sense to me
3506933 today americans are paying sky high prices for oil and gas and at the same time the bush administration is continuing to spend billions of dollars a year for iraq reconstruction even though that country has huge budget surpluses that is a bankrupt strategy
3506934 yes we need to make sure iraq is on a path to stability but we also need to start investing here at home

3506939 it is imperative that operations remain open at this facility and the highly skilled and hardworking employees continue to safeguard the nation from harmful pathogens in addition while it is important to build a national bio and agro defense facility to study the most dangerous virulent biological threats plum island is not the most suitable facility or location
3506940 in view of its decades of service to our national security as well as the high level of expertise and infrastructure already in place plum island should continue to serve our nation in its current capacity as a bio safety level 3 facility
3506941 however i expect the department of homeland security will live up to its word and the wishes of our community and not place a bio safety level 4 facility on plum island

3506950 this administrations failure to hold contractors accountable is outrageous more and more government responsibilities are being passed along to private companies at huge cost to american taxpayers and at the same time more and more reports emerge of fraud waste and abuse in the contracting process this pattern must be brought to an end which is why i have introduced legislation to bring critically needed reform to the government contracting process and why im calling for an investigation to get to the bottom of this latest abuse of taxpayer resources

3506955 the farm bill takes steps to ensure that small farms receive the support and resources they need but the bush administration is ignoring the letter of the law and undermining the safety net that protects our farmers i urge the usda to apply the provisions of the farm bill fairly and correctly and live up to the commitments we have made to farmers and growers
3506956 effective with the date of publication of this notice to be assured that producers on farms with base acres of 10 acres or less are prohibited from receiving payments as provided in the 2008 farm bill farm service agency county committees coc will not approve requests for farm combination reconstitutions of farms having base acres of 10 acres or less if the request was received after the date of enactment of the 2008 farm bill may 22 2008 however as an exception to the above rule a farm with a total of 10 base acres or less may combine with another farm if one of the farms undergoes a change in land ownership to qualify for this exception the owners of each of the farms participating in the new combination must be identical and have identical shares in both farms
3506957 the managers intend for the department to allow for the aggregation of farms for purposes of determining the suspension of payments on farms with 10 base acres or less the managers expect for the department to review farms in this category on an annual basis rather than prohibiting payments to these farms for the life of the farm bill

3506961 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3506962 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3506963 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3506964 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3506965 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3506966 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3506967 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3506968 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3506969 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3506970 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3506971 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3506972 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3506973 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3506974 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3506975 as first responders local law enforcement units play an integral role in keeping our communities safe
3506976 these federal dollars will allow diamond city to continue to provide the best possible service for residents
3506977 diamond city law enforcement officers need and deserve the very best resources available
3506978 this is an excellent example of how federal funds can be reinvested into our local communities in order to keep all residents safe
3506979 its great to see city officials being proactive about improving the safety of its citizens
3506980 these funds are a great asset that will benefit residents for years to come

3506984 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3506985 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3506986 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas

3506988 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3506989 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3506990 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3506999 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3507000 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation simply doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump
3507001 after listening to it i see that im a bit dramatic because i can listen to everybody elses music and i cant picture anything that theyre saying but with my music i can see something and it creates images in my mind

3507003 who i am how im acting thats how im feeling
3507004 theres never a pretend setup and thats how i work as an actor i dont sit there and smile for the goddamn camera i hate the camera and i hate the people that are holding the camera
3507005 people think im a narcissist because i always talk about me but sh t without me theres no world theres no universe
3507006 i have to make some other choices with it im thinking about taking a guerilla approach to it
3507007 so i think i want to do the videos like that and pocket all the money theyre talking about giving me
3507008 we continue to see unprecedented growth in u s gas production that will eventually overwhelm the u s gas markets
3507009 even if that number were to increase 100 fold in the next ten years to 11 000 000 or roughly 5 percent of the entire vehicle market a formidable goal the impact on natural gas supplies and the natural gas delivery infrastructure would be small equating about 4 percent of total u s natural gas consumption

3507021 it gives the patient a very natural look there is also very little recovery time the procedure is performed in a doctors office and the patient can go home afterward any puffiness usually goes away after a week
3507022 her lips had a more bland appearance before but now they have better definition and have become a nice focal point

3507039 because this is a prepaid card the customer pays no interest on their balance the difference with this card is that cordoba financial group does not earn any interest on the balance
3507040 normally when someone puts money on a prepaid card the company that issues the card will earn interest on the balance until the person spends it this is not the case with cordoba as you can neither earn nor pay interest under sharia law
3507041 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears

3507059 in this first stage what democracy has brought is just an exchange of power among political parties
3507060 nothing has been done and we cannot remain silent any longer
3507061 but mexicans now have the sensation that democracy does not end problems it does not necessarily resolve problems

3507073 we are greatly encouraged by the thoughts and prayers of american homeschoolers
3507074 it gives us hope to know that there are people who have the freedom to educate their own children at home we so appreciate the letters and notes of encouragement these letters help us maintain our focus and in seeking gods will for our family
3507075 germanys approach to home schooling compromises this european law on mobility and forces families to choose between a job and the best interests of the children the need for family friendly employment policies must be recognized throughout the eu we need to have flexibility in the education of children temporarily resident because of work there is also an issue around the attitude to non german families in the german childrens courts i hope the dialogue between the commission and the german state will resolve this discriminatory situation
3507076 imprisonment or fines in this matter are absolutely excessive in my opinion because homeschooling can provide very high quality outcomes this topic is definitely one which we must work through politically there can be no black white declarations but we must discuss this without ideological blinders on
3507077 this poor simple family is being crushed by unbearable pressure from the german states police power primarily because they are homeschoolers
3507078 this father of nine a woodworker told me how difficult this is and the incredible strain its placing on his children his wife and himself as longtime homeschoolers they have irritated the local youth authorities who needed only the pretext of the hospitalization of the mother and other exaggerated claims to seize the children
3507079 while there are some policy makers in some of the states who are willing to take on this important issue of human rights most couldnt be bothered it is going to take increased public awareness and international pressure to confront german society with this outrageous behavior unfortunately it looks like more parents will have to go to jail and more children taken into state custody before german public policy makers wake up and do something its very disturbing that germany can get away with this kind of behavior with such little public comment by other western governments
3507080 lets go do something no ones ever done before lets go do a comic and then do an animated feature

3507085 it seemed they were way too comfortable in the role of victim

3507089 you dont need much change in supply to change oil prices
3507090 you cant force companies to drill where its not economically feasible
3507091 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s
3507092 their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
3507093 why are you letting this happen and how long will it go on
3507094 the nearby streams got depleted and thus locals were forced to fetch water on donkeys from very far areas sometimes you go for five km to bring 40 liter of water which can only be enough for cooking and drinking purposes you do washing or cleaning of clothes once a week
3507095 though i love my village the circumstances and the lack of water forced me to leave for the city where government water networks are available i think the increase of population is responsible for the water crisis as well as the decreasing level of rainfall he added

3507100 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3507101 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3507102 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3507103 our ongoing work with this model and others should lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between climate and global hurricane activity
3507104 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3507105 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3507106 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3507107 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3507108 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3507109 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3507110 i think not im terribly sorry its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
3507111 look at indias green revolution it worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
3507112 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water
3507113 the water table has disappeared they have huge problems with water level with pesticide problems and complications which are now coming home to roost
3507114 look at western australia huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
3507115 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out

3507123 tires that are starting to wear out just arent going to have the traction so youre much more likely to slide
3507124 consumers are putting off until the next paycheck the next month the next six months the next year tires that should be replaced

3507222 apart from establishing contact with prostitutes and gay men two of the highest risk groups we are also trying to educate men about the necessity of using condoms
3507223 traditionally sexual reproductive health issues have targeted women as men in our patriarchal society have regarded this as primarily a womens issue
3507224 the palestinian national aids council held a world aids day conference in the west bank and gaza in december of 2006

3507259 i know that for you it is a far drive to start learning about the issues important to the wonderful people of district 25
3507260 this is yet another example of how mario diaz balart is a typical washington politician showing utter contempt for the voters of the 25th district
3507261 he has no problem giving himself a raise five times or voting against health insurance for our children but ask him to explain those choices to his constituents and hes nowhere to be found
3507262 regardless of my own opinion as to the relative wisdom of any of the proposals i dont like the idea of my taxes being used to lobby me

3507267 mugabe is refusing to concede that if he is head of state as accepted by the mdc then tsvangirai should be the head of government
3507268 its now up to president mbeki to plot the way forward but the issue is that tsvangirai has refused to sign any agreement that will not recognize him as head of government

3507277 now the province gets power from iran under a contract signed about two years ago between the iraqi government and iran
3507278 it is supposed to build voltage regulators each 100 kilometres from the border to the province to avoid loss in the power
3507279 there is another line of power from iran which is being worked on and should be finished within a month
3507280 this will have a great effect on the improvement of the voltage and increasing the hours given
3507281 some houses burnt down because of the extremely high voltage from these

3507325 the first principle of prayer is to be yourself prayer is being yourself before god this may sound obvious but it bears a little developing how do you learn to talk with or be with another human being do you begin completely ignorant and have to learn every step of a proper procedure or are the instincts and inclinations already in place so that you can begin easily enough and grow in facility through experience a lot of prayer is defeated by pseudo ideals one ready way to misconceive it is to think of it as making something beautiful for god you will think good and holy thoughts you will have warm and loving feelings you seek a religious experience you have no religious experience instead god seems distant and disinterested and you struggle to make contact felling alone and rejected the problem is not really personal failure but pseudo ideals prayer is not making something beautiful for god or having god make something beautiful for you or getting into a separate space where your life cannot touch you all the living models of prayer we have considered show us that prayer is rather being yourself before god coming as you are not putting on a face and manufacturing appropriate thoughts and feelings but being yourself and working with the thoughts and feelings that are there

3507327 postures are concerned not really with any kind of physiological training but an inner training of being learning just to be
3507328 the postures of meditation should embody steadiness and ease this occurs as all effort relaxes and coalescence arises revealing that the body and the infinite universe are indivisible then one is no longer disturbed by the play of opposites

3507337 thats why henry viii dissolved the monasteries in the 16th century

3507341 congress the media the public all have an interest in knowing whether were using our resources to make sure the best students have access to the best education

3507349 son if you had cleared each day the area on which you lay down your work would have advanced slowly and you would not have lost heart so the lad did what his father said and in a short time the plot was cultivated

3507490 as mayor i have made turning around the citys schools and investing in our infrastructure among my top priorities because its hopeless to build for our future without either by helping move hundreds of millions of dollars out of our school bureaucracies and into city classrooms and by helping us raise nearly three billion dollars for transit infrastructure daniel squadrons record getting things done for new yorkers is already more impressive than many lifelong legislators daniel squadron is independent hard working and smart three things i always look for when i go into the voting booth i am proud to endorse daniel squadron for state senate and strongly encourage democrats in lower manhattan and brooklyn to vote for him in september

3507545 driving from beyond the suburbs to the city is a way of life for many people
3507546 weve taken toyotas truck heritage to a different level by envisioning a vehicle capable of maneuvering the suburbs as well as dirt roads this compact truck is as comfortable for long commutes as it is for road trips it can accommodate outdoor toys and home improvement supplies plus customers benefit from the hybrid powertrains low emissions and fuel economy
3507547 we studied the trapezoid silhouette from the side profile of the toyota prius and applied it to create an entirely new truck image
3507548 the bold grille showcases toyotas reverse trapezoid and t face theme in a new way
3507549 the bed is defined by the c pillar and is clearly separated from the cab to allow it to stand out from the rest of the profile
3507550 the image of a nato all terrain military truck inspired us to keep the occupants as far forward as possible to maximize rear bed capacity in this compact package
3507551 we balanced colors and fabrics that were both bright and vibrant but also captured an urban rugged feel with their energetic and geometric qualities
3507552 the inspiration behind the exposed structure on the interior was drawn from high end mountain bike frames
3507553 we applied lightweight construction materials such as carbon fiber and aluminum to the instrument panel console and seats for increased structural rigidity while reducing mass
3507554 this concept is the next evolution of the compact truck
3507555 we were able to create a compact truck thats utilitarian has an original profile compared to other pickup trucks has a small but tough character and is economical to operate the a bat is a fun to drive practical package that reflects toyotas environmental sustainability message

3507558 examine whether the systematic effects of behavioral biases extend beyond the domain of financial markets to the aggregate macro economy specifically we investigate whether behavioral frictions adversely affect the level of interstate risk sharing i e state level income smoothing that can be achieved using financial markets to our knowledge this is the first paper that examines whether systematic behavioral biases can in fluence broader macro economic indicators such as state level risk sharing
3507559 because direct measures of cognitive abilities of stock market participants are not available we use the demographic characteristics of the brokerage investors e
3507560 the average rs in states with less sophisticated investors 0 131 is less than half of the average rs in states with greater investor sophistication 0 324 collectively our evidence indicates that the aggregate behavioral biases of individual investors infl uence the level of risk sharing across the u s states
3507561 for example states such as iowa south dakota and kentucky achieve very low less than 10 levels of risk sharing using financial assets

3507770 when the day comes next week when we move our resolution for the joint sitting of the national assembly and senate we will have much more votes than we need to impeach the president
3507771 this is a powerful chargesheet that cannot be challenged by anyone and there will be no defence in front of it
3507772 even now the concerned parties should understand the situation and not waste the time of the nation the impeachment process can be avoided if general musharraf resigns i believe that is the best option for him
3507773 there were 107 votes against musharraf and only four for him even the ppp sherpao which earlier supported musharraf voted against him
3507774 this whole exercise is an exercise for a real transition to democracy

3507778 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3507779 the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown broken promises
3507780 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3507781 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3507782 we hope amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
3507783 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3507784 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3507785 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
3507786 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
3507787 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3507788 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3507789 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3507790 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3507791 individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing and limit or avoid outdoor exercise

3507898 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3507899 we cannot continue with a situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to the problem

3507922 those who once were made partakers of the holy spirit
3507923 those who once tasted the good word of god and the powers of the coming age
3507924 those who were once enlightened having tasted the heavenly gift and having been made partakers of the holy spirit and having tasted the good word of god and the powers of the age to come if they fall away it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance because they recrucify the son of god for themselves and subject him to open shame
3507925 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3507926 israel is following with great concern the developments in south ossetia and abkhazia and hopes the violence will end
3507927 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3507928 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3507929 a small group of georgian soldiers were able to wipe out an entire russian military division thanks to the israeli training
3507930 georgian minister tells israel radio thanks to israeli training were fending off russian military

3507941 and he wanted me to say thank you to you to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people for this tiny little democracy far away from the united states of america
3507942 and i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
3507943 in 2006 i visited senaki and reviewed the georgian troops who had served with honor beside american soldiers in iraq

3507945 weve just seen over the last few days as the russians invaded a sovereign nation georgia and watch the response of this man john mccain to that crisis right strong clear principled the kind of president we need in the white house over the next four years to be there to protect our country our security and our freedom
3507946 the impact of russian actions goes beyond their threat to a democratic georgia
3507947 russia has used violence against georgia to send a signal to any country that chooses to associate with the west and aspire to our shared political and economic values my friends we learned a great cost of the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked with our allies we must stand in united purpose to persuade the russian government to withdraw its troops from georgia

3507950 we are still planning to shoot the fifth mafia in grand rapids we have had some executive decisions that have delayed us but what i am being told is we will be there to film sometime this year and i am hoping it is before the weather changes
3507951 the filming of a major motion picture is a huge economic coup for grand rapids and will result in the immediate influx of about 600 000 just in hotel bookings for the cast and production crew i am very proud to have grand rapids be the site of a new direction for michigans economic growth the buzz about michigan is growing in hollywood and this is only the beginning of creating more jobs for our residents and bringing more income into our communities immediately

3508033 amd ati has been gaining momentum in the overall pc discrete graphics vendor market
3508034 as the first quarter of 2008 data in my file implies amd ati is after a tough 2007 turning its market share back around my understanding is that amd atis new products are gaining traction with pc oems original equipment manufacturers and graphics card makers
3508035 its hard to predict what nvidia will do they could do a board like amd has done or they could go to a more powerful single chip they have the gtx 280 and thats a pretty powerful board now and well just have to wait and see if they can get the gtx 3 to go faster
3508036 basically this is crossfire on one board so basically if you have two pci peripheral component interconnect slots in your computer you can put two of these boards in and end up with four gpus
3508037 each one of those chips is about 1 2 teraflops in compute power if you put eight of them in the board youre talking about a 10 teraflop supercomputer do the math with the board coming up at about 500 if you put four of them in there you spend 2 000 on the board and say you spend another 1 000 on your computer so you spend 3 000 for a 10 teraflop computer i think thats just astounding

3508058 hay significativos avances en la persecuci n del delito de incendio forestal que invita a pensar que estamos ante el comienzo del fin de la impunidad con la que actuaban los incendiarios
3508059 hay que seguir profundizando y demandando para avanzar en la justicia en lo que respecta a los incendios forestales

3508089 chinas press freedom record is an integral part of the olympic story and yet journalists working in the official press centers are being denied information essential to their reporting

3508100 barotex enables our design team to create some of the strongest and most durable automotive components ever produced
3508101 for the natalia sls 2 barotex will be formed into various body panels and our revolutionary d tek chassis where its high strength will add significantly to the automobiles torsional rigidity yet our chassis will be more than a thousand pounds lighter than the conventional steel chassis found on other luxury automobiles of similar size
3508102 in contrast carbon fiber products are petroleum based and we know about the challenges that involves
3508103 not only is lava rock more abundant but our manufacturing process requires far less energy it is friendly to the environment and the automobiles built with barotex are lighter so they use less energy every mile traveled
3508104 we recently received our patent for the proprietary process used to produce barotex
3508105 we are delighted that the first production automobile to integrate this technology will be dimoras natalia sls 2 which abounds with technological breakthroughs from bumper to bumper
3508106 when we began designing our 16 cylinder engine that would erupt with 1200 horsepower we decided to call it the volcano v16 its only natural that we now surround the dimora volcano with volcanic rock from barotex

3508188 our findings have long term implications for how we teach negotiation
3508189 men who try to make a positive impression by being conciliatory risk forfeiting their own economic outcomes and women who try to make positive impressions by being assertive can risk damaging their relationships thus men and women may benefit from different strategies when it comes to balancing the tension in negotiation between empathy and assertiveness

3508209 the ministrys stand has been very unclear they tell us in may to start mentor a new iit and then when it is done against all odds despite infrastructure and faculty constraints they insist on preparatory courses as well this really stretches things too far that apart the question of bringing down the cut off further is not a very good idea and is widely opposed
3508210 we are barely managing the temporary iit gandhinagar campus given the shortage of faculty there is no way we can hold the preparatory course there but it isnt feasible in our mumbai campus either as we are short of space
3508211 at iit missing a single days classes matter how will students manage missing weeks of prep classes also one needs senior faculty for the prep course as these students come from different boards with different sets of sensitivities also even if the cut off is brought down further it is not necessary that all vacant seats will be filled
3508212 the big question is how these vacancies can be filled without compromising the quality of education while at iit kanpur it is not such a big problem those working out of temporary campuses will have a harder time
3508213 the agreement provides for temporary detachment of singapore armed forces saf personnel for a maximum period of eight weeks up to two times a year however small detachments not exceeding eight personnel from saf may be allowed to stay with their equipment stationed in india

3508242 i was a realtor in pacifica for about 20 years and learned that the only streets in our city are in the mobile home park on palmetto avenue francisco boulevard is the correct name other names are avenue drive road court circle etc another subject that i keep reading about is mori point being old timers almost 60 years in pacifica we have always called it moris point do any other old timers out there agree with me im not writing to be critical just wanted to pass this on to you i enjoy reading your column every week i dont always agree with you but thats what makes it interesting respectfully jewell cottrell

3508247 we gave in a bit on the last round of negotiations
3508248 this time around were not willing to make any further concessions
3508249 the five or six largest oems will decide what they want to buy in the marketplace and thats what the industry will follow
3508250 we can learn from what the disk drive folks went through back in the early 80s there were dozens of hard drive makers all scrambling to see who would win out now there are only six major ones left theyre still making and selling lots of drives but the main difference now is that shipments are much larger the customers made their choice then and the same thing will happen in flash
3508251 about when am i not going to lose my job for using flash ssds in my servers
3508252 personally i think ssds are a terrible replacement for hhds at this time for a lot of reasons the biggest of which is that they havent been around long enough to know how they really will perform in heavy duty production situations
3508253 few years and that if they were one half or one quarter the cost they are now there would be a lot more adoption by this point
3508254 right now there are about 60 flash vendors and about 17 organizations doing some kind of standards work
3508255 we were sitting down trying to count up the number of standards organizations that are affiliated with flash in some way
3508256 we came up with 17 that we know of there are probably more the tier 1 oems and thats only five or six guys companies are going to define what is successful in the market
3508257 what their strategies are around ssds sun has some other vendors have but the full playing field hasnt been shown yet
3508258 remote sensing technology which makes it possible to collect data on dangerous or inaccessible areas has gained prominence in recent years due to technological advances
3508259 this technology coupled with space and airborne imaging along with joint cooperation between authorities on both sides of the border can be used to protect both countries against organized crime money laundering and drug human and illegal arms trafficking although traditional border crossings have been tightened up since the 9 11 attacks criminals are now seeking easier access points

3508268 this past quarter we had many operational and corporate successes which unfortunately were offset by the failure of the main gibraltar transformer although the ramp up of gibraltars phase i expansion has proven to be more challenging than originally anticipated our operations team is continuing to make good progress towards achieving the interim design capacity of 46 000 tons per day
3508269 our focus has not changed the gibraltar expansion projects are on time and on budget and we are increasing production as quickly as possible to capitalize on the continued copper market strength the prosperity team is moving ahead with engineering and procurement given the provincial governments recent decision to move prosperity into the environmental assessment review taseko is in an ideal position with near medium and long term production growth from its 100 wholly owned assets

3508276 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3508277 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3508278 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3508279 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3508280 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3508281 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3508282 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3508307 more than half of ischemic strokes 52 in men and 54 in women may have been prevented through adherence to a healthy lifestyle
3508308 for total stroke 47 of cases in the women and 35 of cases in the men may have been prevented
3508309 this study shows that following a healthy lifestyle which has been associated with up to 80 lower risk of coronary risk of diabetes may also prevent more than half of ischemic strokes
3508310 the risk of relapse was still small but certainly not insignificant
3508311 i think these numbers are somewhat reassuring but they also highlight the need for new therapeutic options for women who have completed five years of treatment

3508373 we think byrd can add that veteran presence and some stability to our rotation
3508374 hes been on a roll since the all star break hes been pretty darn good every time out there this is a guy whos been through this before and someone we think can be dependable and we know what were going to get every fifth day it seemed like the right time to add this guy
3508375 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august or september because theres very little you can do about it so this was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran we feel we can trust
3508376 its nice he wont be overwhelmed by anything we can throw at him in this environment in october if were lucky enough to get there we know who paul byrd is hes going to consistently locate and throw strikes and change speeds and show great feel on the mound we think we might be getting him at the right time
3508377 by no means are we giving up on clay buchholz
3508378 far from it we still think hes going to be a huge part of our future and may well prove to be an important part of our present that said we think this move gives us freedom to do the right thing with our rotation rather than forcing people into roles because of injury well see how things play out but by no means is clay buchholz out of our picture

3508382 i changed my motion so i wasnt going over my head with my hands anymore its enabling me to keep the ball down a little bit over the last five games i dont want to jinx myself but ive kept the ball in the yard i had a lot of trouble with home runs during the early to mid season there and i think ive kept the ball down better as of late im throwing a little better breaking ball now and ive got5ten left handers out a lot better over the last five games ive had an up and down season its been a roller coaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident i like the way im throwing the ball i have no fear no wonder about which pitcher is going to show up i feel really good about where i am right now and i think that probably had something to do with why the red sox picked me up

3508384 zero jabbas uncle originally spoke in hutt ese like jabba and then he had a different sluggish voice just like jabba and then george one day was watching it and said i want him to sound like truman capote
3508385 its a hybrid of it but the inspiration is definitely there on capote its one of those things that takes him from being an interesting character and i think really does put him over the top and does something hes a favorite among the crew here
3508386 conversations i never thought id have about star wars characters
3508387 hes of questionable sexuality at least as a slug they tell me that these slugs can be either male or female depending thats something i guess that slugs and snails do
3508388 i wasnt aware of that but i have continuity experts that tell me these things and im like i guess jabba is his sons mother and father from a certain point of view its interesting

3508391 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3508392 i meet and talk to these people i am not a professional psychologist but i am sure i can help people with my own experience as an ex victim of slavery i suffered a lot of domestic violence
3508393 i was forced to work for a man my former husband who treated me like a slave so i feel i know the subject maybe even more than many others and am ready to help people with all my heart
3508394 sometimes we artists actors and musicians are able to bring more public attention to a problem than officials or politicians we speak the language of emotions and feelings
3508395 the one thing we can say with some certainty is its the tip of the iceberg
3508396 he beat me up cut me with knives and there was sexual exploitation as well all kinds of bad things one day i was fed up and couldnt bear it any longer
3508397 my main message when i was talking to these poor girls who suffered so badly because of their naivety was do not feel sorry for yourself
3508398 theres a couple years where youre just happy to be here
3508399 then all of a sudden you realize you play this game because you want to win and want to win a world series id love an opportunity to do that
3508400 job one for me beginning oct 1 is to try to be a good manager of this enterprise
3508401 hes going to try to do the right things for our fans which is to win
3508402 it has been an honor to represent the giants the last 16 years
3508403 i will remain a partner and of course i will always be a giants fan as i have been since i was 8 years old i have always felt that no individual or group of individuals is really the owner of a sports franchise because a team really belongs to the community
3508404 eventually theyll get around to submitting a bidder for baseballs approval but that hasnt happened yet
3508405 nothing is going to happen on that during the next week or two either
3508406 he was like a friend his irreverence and honest approach to the game made it feel like you were watching the game with a friend sitting next to you
3508407 were going to be happy and have fun just the way skip would have wanted it
3508408 i dont come as governor but as one of the thousands of fans who came to love him
3508409 you all were the base notes of the sounds of my fathers life
3508410 it was some new adventure every day win or lose it was always fun
3508411 i always thought oh no where are we going with this
3508412 i think the russians thought they were foiling a major scheme
3508413 it was an honor for them to ask me to do that
3508414 he was just a voice on radio or television until 1990 when i met him and had some drinks with him
3508415 he was a private man who lived a public life
3508416 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3508417 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3508418 this transaction provides tremendous benefits to cvs caremark by accelerating our expansion in very attractive drugstore markets and strengthening our geographic reach
3508419 im really excited to be with a great team thats in a pennant race
3508420 im excited about being with a team that has a chance to win it all ive played for terry francona philly before and im a big fan of tito i think the red sox have a great thing going so its really hard to be disappointed about anything that boston offers
3508421 has occurred in waves like much cultural history its both cyclical and cumulative like a wheel turning showing different sides of itself it is true that life has few gifts to give or receive more gratifying than unfeigned laughter or surprise
3508422 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
3508423 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently
3508424 which is an industry wide trend and the decline pretty much mirrors where we are vis a vis our competitors
3508425 now that death magnetic is complete were ready to start a proper indoor arena tour of the states and canada and we cant wait to visit all of our talli fans here
3508426 it really has been too long hey whats four years amongst friends
3508427 we have to be sure that what was the cause what created it who is responsible all those factors will come into play i know it is where i work but this incident has happened three times before and we must know this will not happen again
3508428 ele est dizendo a mesma coisa que eu tenho dito acredito que sim fortalece a id ia da nova estatal e pelo que soube o vice presidente jos alencar pensa do mesmo modo
3508429 o que tenho dito seguramente em nome dele isso significa que ele que indicou a comiss o est realmente interessado em que se resolva esse problema com uma solu o que seja adequada aos interesses do povo brasileiro

3508441 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on

3508446 lots of kids are calling little kids see that on tv and they may not have even known about gymnastics but now they want to do gymnastics because it looks cool every four years gymnastics gets a big bump
3508447 i can definitely say that while the olympics are going i do train harder because it makes me i want to be there someday
3508448 it seems really hard but i can do it if i really try and get my mind to it
3508449 anytime you see what we saw on tv last night it kind of gets the blood pumping
3508450 be quiet and let the author continue with his lecture he has the right to give his lecture
3508451 he has no right to lecture if he is going to say things in support of israel
3508452 the investigation is still continuing there were a number of adults and children in the house and unfortunately a couple of children were unable to be removed from the house prior to the fire engulfing the whole house
3508453 we believe that the young boy is three and the young girl is just under two
3508454 we had a fairly extensive fire and a lot of thick black smoke
3508455 it is going to be a very difficult year for australia
3508456 it is absolutely essential that wayne swan the treasurer actually do everything he can to increase confidence in the australian economy and not reduce it as he was earlier in the year talking up an inflationary crisis as it was described early in the term of the government
3508457 it makes me angry to see that we havent been able to get agreement over a long period of time
3508458 if youre sitting on the fence about going see a band coming to your town please go any effort you make to get out doesnt even come close to what the band made to get to your town
3508459 qantas discovered an irregularity with paperwork for these aircraft during an internal integrity check of maintenance records
3508460 in line with our prudent response to any maintenance issue however minor we have elected to suspend the operation of the six aircraft while we ensure all our records are 100 per cent accurate and we have advised the casa
3508461 we regularly check our records and detect a record keeping anomaly on average once a year
3508462 how about this one here you become an m d
3508463 what happens then you dont like it or you dont like the lifestyle they lead you have little hiccups some would call but these are learning experiences that will get you to whatever it is you need to do
3508464 i want to go into education which still goes for medical
3508465 i like football a lot and i really wanted to play nfl but if that doesnt work i kind of want to do medical
3508466 well thats my second major and i wanted to be a federal agent
3508467 i got to remove a spleen on tv on a computer which was fun then we got to extract some dna
3508468 more of it was what are you doing to achieve those goals in professionalism things that we had talked about and getting us mentors and contacts which was great and fabulous
3508469 im five and a half months gone and we cant wait for the baby

3508473 there are no reports of an american troop being killed
3508474 at least 127 american military instructors were in georgia at the beginning of the conflict there were joint training sessions that happened right before the start of the conflict
3508475 if we need to do dna tests we will do it
3508476 they were specifically to train them for a coming operation iraqi freedom deployment
3508477 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3508478 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3508479 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3508480 we cannot continue with a situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to the problem
3508481 see mario does the breaststroke and thus its perfect mental training for envisioning the actual olympic hall
3508482 who paid for george w bush to go to the olympics
3508483 its notable that suddenly with output rising opec officials are concerned about adherence to quotas and oversupply
3508484 however as we look toward the fourth quarter of the year barring a more significant decline in demand the world is going to need opec oil to avoid a larger inventory draw than is normal for the fourth quarter pulling inventories at that rate would be very bullish for prices
3508485 geographic reach has become a more important thing for us
3508486 we had a ton of receipts last year for different things snacks for them because we like to give them a snack at least 500 a year
3508487 its very tough because our income is not as great as some other employees around the state it kind of burns a hole in the pocket
3508488 we do it because we love them and we want them to have everything
3508489 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3508490 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3508491 its critical to get correct information before you make a decision
3508492 weve heard of some people going door to door in ozaukee county and telling people that this is the only way to save their trees
3508493 thats really misleading theyre cherry picking data to make that statement
3508494 if you have a greater than 40 percent dieback in the canopy its not in your best interest to try any kind of rescue treatment
3508495 at that point its very difficult for that tree to recover
3508496 we have very good research data that shows the area of highest risk is within 10 12 miles of a known infestation
3508497 outside of that area i really dont think theres a need to treat
3508498 we have time probably until next may before the adult insects begin to fly to make an informed and appropriate management decision
3508499 serve an important role in search and rescue operations and also function as a general firefighting tool
3508500 this paper and the work that this group has done on reconsolidation and drug taking behaviors represent some of the most promising avenues of research for treating addiction
3508501 i dont know of any other study in the field of drug addiction where an acute treatment causes long term cessation of drug taking behavior in rodent models
3508502 this is an example of hypothesis driven basic research that can be readily translated to the treatment of cocaine addiction in humans
3508503 the bounty of course is an organic farm at our shared house the white house
3508504 this is the kind of assistance we are receiving now
3508505 i have family connections in dallas as far back as the 19th century so coming to dallas is something of a spiritual return
3508506 yet in many ways dallas will be a brave new world the challenge to build a 21st century opera company equal to its remarkable new venue proved impossible to resist
3508507 there are opportunities to be there for people who are reaching out for help
3508508 people get wrapped up in not wanting to violate the persons trust
3508509 but you have to take action if you dont take action and they do hurt themselves or someone else you have to live with that for the rest of your life
3508510 threatening to do that happens a lot more than you think
3508511 everyone knew she had a drug problem but nobody did anything
3508512 lenders will just decide to stop lending in certain areas
3508513 we could end up with an entire class of borrowers that i call the unlendables

3508519 the reasoning has primarily been cost and the other platforms provide the services they need for virtualizing branch offices as well as development test or training environments
3508520 its not just about managing vmware enough to get customers to convert to hyper v we are looking at a full management experience for both sets of users
3508521 we recognize that a customer isnt going to have just microsoft hyper v servers or virtual servers they are going to have vmware racks too and if they do vmm will manage it
3508522 obviously since the acquisition of xenserver citrix would be at the top of that
3508523 at this point it is definitely something we want to do when we feel there is enough market adoption of other virtualization technologies
3508524 right now when we talk to customers they either have not adopted mixed environments at all or have done so in small amounts
3508525 vmware currently doesnt have as much to gain by supporting products with small market penetration
3508526 rushing to support these platforms could also be viewed as vmware validating their relevance which is something vmware is in no hurry to do
3508527 its easier to sell services like this if theyre packaged with high speed data or a subscription to a starz channel
3508528 geographic reach has become a more important thing for us
3508529 instead of returning those paintings he decided to keep them he wanted to cash in on them
3508530 he took the view that a finders fee was the usual and standard practice
3508531 i loved those paintings for all those years and they were gone

3508535 the surface of the sun is now as hot as the core
3508536 there are those in our midst who seem to believe that once again man is on the thresh hold of discovering the answers to the final secrets of the universe this is undoubtedly an echo from the final years of the nineteenth century but after that period of premature claims one might have expected a little more reticence from the modern godfathers of world science

3508569 as the economy and housing markets change in pennsylvania and around the country some mortgage companies are using aggressive new tactics to solicit customers
3508570 todays consumer protection lawsuits are an important step to protect consumers from illegal conduct and send a clear message that lending companies must obey the law
3508571 this is the most extensive campaign of telemarketing calls to consumers on the do not call list ever investigated by my office
3508572 using an international call center they invaded the homes of thousands of pennsylvania residents with unsolicited and unwanted phone calls marketing mortgage loans that they were not licensed to sell
3508573 im looking forward to this one definitely ive got a lot of friends and family coming down from chico growing up in northern california being a 49ers fan and then going through the 2005 nfl draft and all that that was its going to be exciting to go back there and play against the team i grew up watching

3508582 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3508583 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3508584 this unconfirmed report saying the mdc is effectively out of the power sharing deal if this is true this is the total collapse of the power talks
3508585 without morgan tsvangirai who is the main man this deal is meaningless and the international community will reject it

3508590 what did your pastor preach in the last week you dont know
3508591 i think that people were legitimately offended by some of the comments that he had made in the past
3508592 the fact that he is my former pastor i think makes it a legitimate political issue so i understand that
3508593 it is also true that to run a snippet of 30 second sound bites selecting out of a 30 year career simplified and caricatured him and caricatured the church and i think that was done in a fairly deliberate way
3508594 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister
3508595 for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations

3508597 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex
3508598 when it comes to video games parents should know that what they play is a resource that helps demystify one of the most popular and challenging forms of entertainment their kids are into
3508599 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play
3508600 of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3508601 the media takes advantage of the old adage that if it bleeds it leads
3508602 watch the evening news how many positive news stories are there and how many stories do you see about murders robberies and fires its rare when the local news reports a positive story
3508603 pay attention to what you read after you have finished reading it you will know the reason youre reading it

3508606 the west palm beach police department has a zero tolerance police for use of excessive force following an internal investigation which the department launched itself without a complaint from the robbery suspect chief delsa bush substantiated that the incident on may 26th 2008 was a violation of policy and the involved officers have all either resigned or have been served with notices of termination as of this date
3508607 in this particular case having the video i chose to substantiate the charge of the use of excessive force
3508608 there was a thin line basically between giving officers accommodation and then ending up having to discipline them
3508609 i just thought oh my god how is this happening completely shocked and disappointed at the same time
3508610 its devastating to the family this gentlemans never been in trouble before its probably gonna destroy his life

3508622 you wont have to worry about paying the fine because im going to send you to jail
3508623 we are greatly encouraged by the thoughts and prayers of american homeschoolers
3508624 it gives us hope to know that there are people who have the freedom to educate their own children at home we so appreciate the letters and notes of encouragement these letters help us maintain our focus and in seeking gods will for our family
3508625 germanys approach to home schooling compromises this european law on mobility and forces families to choose between a job and the best interests of the children the need for family friendly employment policies must be recognized throughout the eu we need to have flexibility in the education of children temporarily resident because of work there is also an issue around the attitude to non german families in the german childrens courts i hope the dialogue between the commission and the german state will resolve this discriminatory situation
3508626 imprisonment or fines in this matter are absolutely excessive in my opinion because homeschooling can provide very high quality outcomes this topic is definitely one which we must work through politically there can be no black white declarations but we must discuss this without ideological blinders on
3508627 this poor simple family is being crushed by unbearable pressure from the german states police power primarily because they are homeschoolers
3508628 this father of nine a woodworker told me how difficult this is and the incredible strain its placing on his children his wife and himself as longtime homeschoolers they have irritated the local youth authorities who needed only the pretext of the hospitalization of the mother and other exaggerated claims to seize the children
3508629 while there are some policy makers in some of the states who are willing to take on this important issue of human rights most couldnt be bothered it is going to take increased public awareness and international pressure to confront german society with this outrageous behavior unfortunately it looks like more parents will have to go to jail and more children taken into state custody before german public policy makers wake up and do something its very disturbing that germany can get away with this kind of behavior with such little public comment by other western governments

3508661 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
3508662 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
3508663 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

3508671 its notable that suddenly with output rising opec officials are concerned about adherence to quotas and oversupply
3508672 however as we look toward the fourth quarter of the year barring a more significant decline in demand the world is going to need opec oil to avoid a larger inventory draw than is normal for the fourth quarter pulling inventories at that rate would be very bullish for prices

3508674 whats critical here is that early weight loss may provide lasting benefits for risk factor control that in turn can reduce diabetes related complications and mortality
3508675 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3508676 these findings suggest that even in the face of weight regain losing weight can have long lasting benefits in type 2 diabetes
3508677 the therapeutic advantage achieved through weight loss is exceedingly important given the close connection between glycemic and blood pressure control and cardiovascular outcomes
3508678 we dont know if the initial weight loss increases the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes are the reason for the long term health benefits what we do know is that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death

3508683 did a snell certified helmet work better at protecting a person in the real world than a plain old dot certified or equivalent helmet the answer was no in real street conditions the dot or equivalent helmets worked just as well as the snell certified helmets in the case of fatal accidents there was one more important discovery in the hurt report there were essentially no deaths to helmeted riders from head injuries alone some people in the study those involved in truly awful bone crushing aorta popping crashes did sustain potentially fatal head injuries even though they were wearing helmets the problem was that they also had on average three other injuries that would have killed them if the head injury hadnt in other words a crash violent enough to overwhelm any decent helmet will usually destroy the rest of the body as well

3508754 the layers of the geocolumn could only happen with rapid flood sediment deposition and normal aggregate seperation some of the layers show mixing as happens in wave motion
3508755 the bible states clearly that when the flood began all the fountains of the great deep were broken up in a single day and the water came forth this great cataclysm was foretold in the names of the first ten patriarchs and noah was warned more than 100 years in advance to prepare an ark to the saving of his house

3508763 the mt st helens volcanic flood did produce exactly what we see at the grand canyon complete with thousands of polystrate upright trees
3508764 theres not always the same material for the layers and so we have short layers non conformaties something evolution uniformitarians have no explaination for if there were millions of years between each age of the geo column they should be the same all over the planet but they are not the geological column is another textbook fiction
3508765 im not interested in opinions i want lab testable scientific fact as how these happened if it is your opinion that everything was just a bunch of local floods over millions of years science doesnt support your opinion for the stated reasons there is no erosion there are polystrate fossils there is a universal chalk layer the best youve come up with so far is to deny they even exist
3508766 the water is right there in the oceans the mountains have been pushed up fossils could happen no other way than a worldwide flood what there is no evidence of is millions of years please provide some

3508826 soll eine handreichung f r lehrkr fte zum islam alle aktuellen und wichtigen aspekte und str mungen des islam in berlin darstellen
3508827 dieser entwurf ist von der bildungsverwaltung bisher weder genehmigt noch gar freigegeben wir werden die in der ffentlichkeit diskutierten aspekte vor einer freigabe genau abw gen
3508828 es ist nicht sinnvoll den lehrern einen text zu geben der besagt wie wir uns den islam w nschen sondern womit sie es zu tun haben
3508829 statt islamischen hardlinern die t ren zu berlins schulen immer weiter zu ffnen sollte bildungssenator j rgen z llner daf r sorgen dass der regul re unterricht an berlins schulen berhaupt noch stattfindet aufgrund falscher r cksichtnahme auf religi se gef hle k nnen die lehrpl ne in einigen f chern kaum noch eingehalten werden
3508830 das ist teilweise nicht unser wunsch aber gerichte haben gegen uns entschieden

3508841 we are disappointed with todays ruling and are considering all of our appellate options it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power here not only did these officials cause untold harm to two individuals who honorably served their country they also jeopardized our national security for short term political gain courts must be available to remedy precisely this kind of harm to ensure such conduct is neither condoned nor repeated

3508846 the cea cnet indexes provide market observers a new metric on the economy and the first of its kind metric to gauge the on going health of the consumer technology sector
3508847 by eliciting subjective probabilities the indexes are better at capturing consumers attitudes and feelings about the economy
3508848 results from the cea cnet indexes are consistent with what we are seeing elsewhere spending on consumer technologies remains a priority for consumers despite the overhanging economic uncertainty
3508849 consumer electronics have become an indispensable part of peoples lives and a major factor in the health of the u s economy

3508885 that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
3508886 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was

3508895 im convinced from talking to her that shes been grossly overcharged
3508896 she did not in any way initiate or cause the death of her son and we are going to i think have a very easy time proving that
3508897 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots she bought the program hook line and sinker
3508898 son mas importantes los ridos que mantener el entorno de praileaitz
3508899 necesitamos que macnelly empiece a funcionar por la calidad que tiene
3508900 est en un per odo de adaptaci n y manejando situaciones que a lo mejor no le acomodan en la cancha yo jugu en el extranjero y por muchas condiciones que uno tenga la cosa cuesta
3508901 lo he respaldado y mantenido en cancha pese a que no ha estado tan preciso aunque no solamente l en el ltimo partido trataremos que siga tomando confianza
3508902 respetamos a nuestro rival pero sabemos que ellos tambi n nos respetan a nosotros nuestro objetivo es lograr un triunfo nuestra preparaci n ha sido muy buena y creo que f sicamente estamos bien seguro que los detalles durante el encuentro ser n los que decidan el resultado
3508903 tenemos algo a nuestro favor y es que jugamos en casa con nuestro p blico su apoyo ser de gran ayuda porque los jugadores lo notan desde el campo tambi n pensamos que al atl tico de madrid le beneficia empezar esta eliminatoria como visitante pero nosotros ya hemos empezado la temporada y estamos a otro nivel
3508904 uruguay es un rival directo y hay que buscar ganarle
3508905 nuestro deseo es construir primero un buen equipo para que compita con mucha claridad de local estamos mentalizados para enfrentar a uruguay porque es un enemigo directo y hay que buscar ganarle
3508906 para el partido frente a ecuador van a estar uno o dos jugadores que no han hecho parte del proceso ser una convocatoria con base en los jugadores que pueden estar en los partidos frente a uruguay y chile llamaremos 18 jugadores y para los partidos por eliminatorias tendremos un grupo de 22
3508907 de cara a los dos partidos ante uruguay y chile no hay la menor duda de que vamos a estar trabajando desde el 1 de septiembre si dios quiere con el 90 por ciento de los jugadores
3508908 tenemos confianza en el triunfo los uruguayos tienen mejores ubicaciones en el r nking mundial pero la davis hay que saberla jugar
3508909 he llamado a muchos para conocerlos y para entrenarnos durante 15 d as en busca de alcanzar la mejor forma
3508910 this is the kind of assistance we are receiving now
3508911 tentei jogar no domingo passado mas senti dores na perna esquerda e n o adiantava entrar em campo sem estar 100
3508912 n o recebemos sequer um telefonema demonstrando interesse no renan
3508913 realmente uma promessa uma meta e um objetivo vou aproveitar o bom trabalho do renato ga cho que conquistou o t tulo da copa do brasil 2007 e foi vice da libertadores
3508914 tenho o time definido dependo apenas do arouca o volante se recupera de fratura na m o esquerda quero amanh quarta feira coloca esta equipe em campo e botar em pr tica a parte t tica e t cnica
3508915 mesmo n o conhecendo nada do fluminense j estou me dando bem aqui sei a import ncia de se fazer um trabalho espero ter a mesma efici ncia da poca de botafogo apesar de n o ter conquistado um t tulo
3508916 quando pequeno voc torce por algum time e eu era fluminense mas se eu n o fizer o time ganhar ningu m quer saber de nada volto a dizer que quero aproveitar o bom trabalho do renato ga cho
3508917 o eduardo est em processo de negocia o me parece que est bem encaminhado temos a op o do len lson bem preparado o eduardo vamos deix lo de fora deste jogo com o botafogo para que ele possa definir a situa o
3508918 people feel now that if the court doesnt hear this were all in trouble
3508919 it will give people license to basically invest in judicial races
3508920 may adopt recusal standards more rigorous than due process requires
3508921 invigorating recusal would help courts currently under siege to seize the high ground and recover the respect of a disenchanted public
3508922 some people characterize ted as conservative but this issue cuts across all ideologies
3508923 such confidence is of particular value to those engaged in commerce who rely on even handed justice to make informed financial and investment decisions
3508924 to the extent that any litigant a company or an individual feels they have to participate in a campaign in order to get a fair hearing thats not good
3508925 its clearly a huge problem but judges take it personally
3508926 having ted olson and me on the same side thats good
3508927 at this point i think businesses would be delighted if money got taken off the table
3508928 palm beach is a barrier island kind of vulnerable to the elements
3508929 its always nice when they say nice things about you
3508930 the aspen or hamptons papers they would be relegated to the society page
3508931 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him he sent a personal message asking her to get on board
3508932 he has always admired her music and thinks she is the perfect choice because of her unique appeal to black and white voters she believes he is going to be the first black american president and she is honoured to be a part of that
3508933 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
3508934 i came to realise how much we take at face value
3508935 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
3508936 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
3508937 there are stars seen in egypt and cyprus which are not seen in the northerly regions
3508938 the space agencies of the world are involved in an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit
3508939 the space shuttle is a joke and a very ludicrous joke
3508940 nobody knows anything about the true shape of the world
3508941 the known inhabited world is flat just as a guess id say that the dome of heaven is about 4 000 miles away and the stars are about as far as san francisco is from boston
3508942 shes sworn out an affidavit that she never hung by her feet in australia she sailed a ship over here and she did not get on it upside down and she did not sail straight up she sailed right straight across the ocean we consider that a very important proof that the world is flat
3508943 there wasnt a period in my life like serena went through where i was doing drugs and having sex with my best friends boyfriend
3508944 its like the prospect of an irs audit the perception of risk promotes voluntary compliance
3508945 we are routinely bringing in approximately a quarter million dollars per month
3508946 its not about how much revenue were taking in with these cameras its about changing driver behavior
3508947 a defesa entende que o rbitro tem que tomar as provid ncias para a retirada de imprensa no momento certo e isso n o aconteceu
3508948 n o poderia esperar uma decis o melhor j que o rbitro foi quem se equivocou e o figueirense n o merecia pagar por isso
3508949 is it possible to breastfeed in public modestly if so how is breastfeeding at mass by definition immodest
3508950 youre like 10 you cant cook are you sure you made them do they have weed in them
3508951 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3508952 kim previously declined the offer for the cover citing her religious beliefs and devotion to god but a source close to kim says
3508953 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3508954 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3508955 little yang peiyis failure to be selected was mainly because of her appearance
3508956 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3508957 is this what you reporters are focusing on about the opening ceremonies
3508958 illustrates an important aspect of these olympic games it is all about projecting the right image of china with no respect for honesty or for the audience
3508959 i do not think the chinese state realizes how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3508960 its not a hell no right now and its not a hell yes either
3508961 i expect and hope well increase the number of seats we have
3508962 we need to get up over 55 and i think 60 would be great sixty is really a magical number because then you have the votes for cloture
3508963 you need water recycling and desalinization and conservation and many other things
3508964 we believe this is a balanced measure and we strongly believe the time is now
3508965 there is no silver bullet when it comes to water
3508966 i feel like nancy pelosi as the democratic leader has failed our country miserably funding for more war the speakers failed to hold george bush and dick cheney accountable
3508967 vor allem im s dlichen baden w rttemberg anhaltende schauer teils berschwemmungsgefahr deutlich k hler als zuletzt
3508968 this is the best evidence to date that elite suppressors can have fully pathogenic virus
3508969 thats a good sign in terms of developing a therapeutic vaccine
3508970 mondays claim from clinton spokesman howard wolfson that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
3508971 i think howard is fine in engaging in this kind of speculation but it doesnt really mean very much
3508972 halvard solness a successful architect and builder in a small norwegian town has mercilessly dominated his employees and his wife aline hilde wangel a vivacious young woman arrives unannounced hilde has idolized solness for ten years since in the early stages of his career when he built a large church in her hometown and heroically climbed to the top of the tower to celebrate its dedication the architects presence had a profound effect on the young girl of 12 when he promised to return and build her a kingdom today the ten years are up and hilde has come to reap what he has sown
3508973 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
3508974 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
3508975 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
3508976 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
3508977 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
3508978 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
3508979 modulation of brain activity to provide symptomatic relief from growing number of diseases such as parkinsons depression and epilepsy has become the treatment of choice when all other options fail
3508980 the interface between the cells of the brain and the surface of the implanted electrode determines whether these treatments work or not by coating electrode surfaces with carbon nanotubes we can improve the efficiency of this cell electrode interface by one thousand times or even more
3508981 for an electrophysiologist that is the difference the nanotube coated electrodes make in what we can see on our oscilloscopes
3508982 were going to have to move after were done filming
3508983 you can hear the tour guides like just yesterday we saw lauren conrad pulling into her driveway and she stopped to get the mail
3508984 l a is a really young city and its great for now but eventually im going to want to settle down a little bit
3508985 hes got this really cool style and im always bugging him that we should do a guys line together
3508986 it would be more his thing but i would help him with it
3508987 i believe in a private ballot i dont want to ever influence someones vote or have my vote change someones opinion of me
3508988 its to ensure better care for people living with parkinsons its the hope that science moves at a quicker pace than the disease walking for parkinsons allows individuals to play an important role in helping to raise funds to ease the burden and find a cure
3508989 it is hard to believe that we have grown from one small walk in southwestern ontario in 1995 raising 11 000 to eight walks in 2007 raising 270 000
3508990 we are optimistic that we will meet our objective of 320 000 this phenomenal growth pattern is proof of the communities growing support and need for better services and further research to help our parkinsons cause
3508991 is the way you are talking to me the way you talk to passengers
3508992 but yes i did a year ago because i moved into a house being renovated my son was going off the college time goes by quickly
3508993 i think what this study demonstrates to us is that we have to be diligent for the rest of our lives which is not the same as saying we have to be fearful but we need to continue to look for small cancers or subtle evidence of recurrent disease long after weve finished radiation therapy or chemotherapy
3508994 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3508995 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3508996 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3508997 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3508998 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3508999 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3509000 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3509001 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3509002 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3509003 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3509004 the billionaires vinegar the mystery of the worlds most expensive bottle of wine

3509013 the camp is a great way for our football program to give back to the community
3509014 we try to do this every three years which gives every junior high kid an introduction to football this is an especially good year to host the camp with the new turf at sherman field
3509015 teach abstinence from sexual activity outside of marriage as the expected standard for school age children
3509016 all funded programs are required to be consistent with the a h definition of abstinence education prescribed in the social security act

3509019 false misleading or distorted information about abortion contraception and gender roles and routinely presented religious beliefs as scientific fact
3509020 when methods of contraception are not discussed key health information is not provided to students
3509021 intimate relationships can be harmful for some people however the reality is that the majority of people have had sexual relationships prior to marriage with no negative repercussions
3509022 sex in teen years may reduce the probability of a stable happy marriage as an adult
3509023 teen abstinence may increase the probability of a healthy marriage
3509024 accurate balanced sex education including information about contraception and condoms is a basic human right of youth

3509076 over the past few weeks various dup representatives have been saying that there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice
3509077 while a week may be a short time in politics i somehow think that nigel dodds was not thinking of at most a mere 2 years when he talked about a political lifetime
3509078 the northern ireland executive needs to get on with the work of delivering for northern ireland of addressing the economic downturn giving certainty to parents and teachers over the post primary transfer procedure and letting hard pressed families know if they are going to have to pay water charges
3509079 i refute the claim made by gerry adams that all the parties had signed up to an irish language act and the devolution of policing and justice at st andrews
3509080 at no time did the ulster unionist party agree to these proposals at or subsequent to st andrews indeed the uup had never endorsed the st andrews agreement believing it to be a retrograde step for unionism and northern ireland
3509081 in the midst of community dissatisfaction with the dup negotiating the devolution of policing and justice after promising it would not happen in a political lifetime the crisis in education as parents prepare to send their children back to school with no idea of how post primary transfer will work and an economic downturn hitting northern ireland businesses it is disturbing that the dup is spending its time trawling through old website stories rather than focusing on governing northern ireland
3509082 while mr poots and his colleagues rely on websites for their knowledge of the conservative party i am glad that my party leader can work directly face to face with david cameron and owen paterson
3509083 the orange order has a long and proud history of cultural religious and social activism in northern ireland
3509084 as for mr poots other suggestion that those with labour sympathies are being abandoned by the uup i would suggest that mr poots consult with his own party leader on this issue only last week peter robinson said in the event of a hung parliament the dup would make an assumption in favour of the conservative party when he takes a break from trawling websites mr poots should really have the odd chat with mr robinson

3509159 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3509160 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3509161 a single endorsement does not hide the fact that sen obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party
3509162 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3509163 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3509164 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3509165 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3509166 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3509167 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness

3509247 we definitely see hactivism taking place from people who have a political ideology and jump on the bandwagon with bots to help promote their opinions and viewpoints whether that be for war or against war or for or against certain countries
3509248 this appears to be more of an intelligence gathering effort rather than a distributed denial of service attack
3509249 the lightweight attacks that took place well over a month prior to this incident indicates other actors with motives different than hactivism are likely involved by the incident
3509250 someone performed lightweight ddos against a site that later became the target of significant attacks
3509251 it appears that someone was sizing up what the resources and capabilities of servers of interest were
3509252 when these attacks first took place before the hactivism jumped on the bandwagon who was behind that and who organized those attacks
3509253 the sequence of events tends to force you to acknowledge that there are likely other actors and other motives involved other than just the reactive hactivism weve seen online

3509265 the campaign dollars being spent for television ads on the olympics are not being further enhanced by paid on line ads on olympic related web sites
3509266 we werent notified we came outside and saw the helicopter and then i had all the kids go inside lock the doors lock the windows and kept them inside we went back outside i was talking to the neighbors the police pulled up and didnt tell us anything except everybody needs to go in the house because they were going to let the dogs loose they ended up capturing him two houses down and none of us in this immediate area were notified its kind of upsetting and worrisome especially when you have little kids and someone like that is running in your neighborhood and youre not aware of it
3509267 there are two reasons why they could not have been notified number one the actual message was sent out and canceled very shortly after so only about 70 people out of the 470 that were going to be notified actually got notification the second reason is that if someone has an unpublished number we dont have that in the system
3509268 i think as soon as they have any information regarding a suspect i think they immediately need to put the call out i dont think they should wait
3509269 this is the most intense crisis in u s russia relations since the end of the cold war
3509270 this is a setback for u s russia relations and it will make it very difficult for this administration to push forward any kind of positive initiative
3509271 this will confirm the views of those that have been russia critics and have taken the harder line
3509272 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like its from another time
3509273 unless someone has a particularly brilliant idea to give it some impetus there should be a do no damage mode with russia before january 2009
3509274 we thought saakashvili was going to be a nice prudent democrat and failed to look at the signs we talk ourselves into these things

3509284 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace

3509286 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3509287 we cannot continue with a situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to the problem
3509288 the friendship represents early maritime trade of new england and the united states
3509289 her role is to educate the public about early maritime trade and one of the ways she does that is to sail to other ports and with our onboard rangers tell the story
3509290 i think what makes it interesting is the friendship is actually a national parks service tall ship
3509291 they made many many journeys back and forth and that was how we got our goods that was the basis for international commerce we experience today

3509293 boston logan leads the u s in several categories when it comes to improved aviation safety for the traveling public
3509294 pilots like it because they can see the improvements that the massachusetts port authority massport has implemented over the years from better runway signage markings and new runway status lights to more taxiways every project makes a difference
3509295 boston has even delivered several initiatives like the enhanced runway marking and signage project ahead of schedule and gone above and beyond the faa regulations to make its airport safer
3509296 its clear that their management and workers place a high premium on collaboration with all industry representatives to get the job done
3509297 boston logan is deeply honored to receive this award said edward c
3509298 this award not only signifies that the airport gets it when it comes to making pilots key players on our safety team it also represents a strong vote of confidence about the work we do to improve safety
3509299 the format is steeped in reality its not contrived its a unique storytelling angle on weddings that has never been seen on television before
3509300 but now she thinks its time to do something for herself
3509301 getting on im a celeb is not about being famous in her own right its about doing something for herself
3509302 of all the housemates he wants to be here the least and when someone does feel that way it makes it harder to get on with them in the house
3509303 shes not really bothered about being on big brother if she was she would have auditioned for her its just a chance to be with her boyfriend but you cant just come in at the end and reap all the benefits and rewards from it
3509304 he dont really enjoy his time in here now and hes said if he stays here hes not going to do anything around the house
3509305 i dont trust her id say shes devious she doesnt actually say some things she makes you feels uncomfortable with the way she is acting its all a game she creates rows i think
3509306 hes very arrogant and controlling within the house and the way he speaks to people i still do wonder what rex is doing here i do feel that he still looks down on people
3509307 rex has been really really bad to live with from day one hes bossed people about hes been nasty hes tried to brew up arguments hes been banging on for the last eight weeks about how bored he is and how much he wants his girlfriend and all theyve really done since arriving in the house is bicker
3509308 although shes good fun its just all a bit of glamour in this house for her and i think generally she doesnt even enjoy it nicole is very very selfish
3509309 i just dont really agree with the way he handles things especially today being nasty and stirring up little comments i dont think he deserves to be here the way he keeps going on about how he wants to go home
3509310 i just feel like she licks kats a e the whole time they sing together they just do everything together and i do believe its because rachel believes that kats going to win and its an easy way to get into the final
3509311 i just dont feel comfortable i just dont want to live with lisa anymore
3509312 i wasnt upset that she gave it to hell it was that she lied to all the housemates that it was better it was clear which was the better cake
3509313 if i was up for nomination against kat and ended up staying people would see me as a nice guy and id be liked

3509324 while there is still a decided preference for senator obama the more conservative element of the christian population is slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like as the finer points of a wide range of issues are clarified by each nominee the initial excitement about senator obama has lost some luster to an increasing number of people whose vote is influenced by their spiritual perspectives if sen mccain converts such apprehensions into votes this will be a closer race than many have anticipated

3509335 in the near future the fbi will determine the best way to address the science involved in the anthrax case
3509336 the overriding message is that there are no accurate or reliable figures of deaths in iraq
3509337 both promotion and criticism of these lancet figures for deaths in iraq are solely attributable to people caring how many people have actually died
3509338 both promotion and criticism of these lancet figures for deaths in iraq are solely attributable to people caring how many people have actually died
3509339 thats 91 of all estimated deaths in iraq are violent
3509340 so youll note that with both the majority of the population and violence in the capital and immediately surrounding districts
3509341 thats 91 of all estimated deaths in iraq are violent
3509342 so youll note that with both the majority of the population and violence in the capital and immediately surrounding districts
3509343 brookings cites 28000 recorded deaths out of 44000 occurring in just baghdad without its immediately surrounding provinces im quite happy using that as a basis for stating that the majority of violent deaths are occurring in baghdad and its immediately surrounding provinces where health services and press coverage are also most competant i assume if you didnt also youd say so
3509344 violence that is occurring in the country at this time
3509345 yes it is youre just confusing caring how many people are reported as having been killed as a result of your actions with giving a shit about loss of life
3509346 caring how many people are reported as having been killed
3509347 both promotion and criticism of these lancet figures for deaths in iraq are solely attributable to people caring how many people have
3509348 for those deltoid readers in salt lake city ill note that les roberts and i are both presenting separately at the joint statistical meetings this summer

3509352 belief that the position of venus in the sky at the time of our birth affects our love life
3509353 belief that a chi substance flows through channels in our body to affect our health
3509354 the mind grows giddy looking into the abyss of time
3509355 god is real and so are demons and the pope is right to have a exorcist
3509356 its ok to study the universe and where it began but we should not inquire into the beginning itself because that was the moment of creation and the work of god
3509357 all matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force we must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind this mind is the matrix of all matter
3509358 science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature and that is because in the last analysis we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve
3509359 a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it
3509360 anybody who has been seriously engaged is scientific work of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words ye must have faith it is a quality which the scientist cannot dispense with
3509361 angels exist in another reality completely cut off from our space and time
3509362 angels leave their rarified realm every so often to pay a visit to humans
3509363 angels exist in another reality completely cut off from our space and time
3509364 i dont believe in god but neither do i think science can tell us anything about whether jesus was born to a virgin or rose from the dead
3509365 claiming that the virgin birth and resurrection didnt happen because things dont normally work that way is going to sound stupid to everyone except one subsection of people who dont believe in the virgin birth or resurrection
3509366 no duh sherlock thats why they call the virgin birth a miracle if it were supposed to have been a natural event no one would have made a big whoop about it
3509367 i dont want anyone to put forth a nonscientific claim people shouldnt be talking about such things it rots their brains and is the cause of most if not all current and past tragedies
3509368 angels leave their rarified realm every so often to pay a visit to humans
3509369 here are the words jesus told me to write to you
3509370 because in a universe where natural laws only work most of the time and they can be violated at any time by supernatural forces there is no point in studying the universe
3509371 when chanting the right formula by a person whos given enough alms in the past month

3509374 the difficult task of treading the line between being a representative of science and building an interface with culture and politics i couldnt do that job id be inspiring rioting mobs outside the office window
3509375 science has nothing to say about the virgin birth 2000 years ago
3509376 the only evidence against virgin birth would be a dna test
3509377 enough people discuss this topic that it is something worth debating
3509378 thus we can dismiss those few scientists and feel good that science as a whole doesnt think religion is ridiculous
3509379 prove to me that there isnt something more to this world than what we see
3509380 prove to me that there isnt a perfect teapot orbiting around the sun
3509381 as soon as you explicitly invoke the supernatural it is excluded from science via methodological naturalism
3509382 science has nothing to say about the virgin birth 2000 years ago
3509383 one time events that are buried in the past may or may not leave traces of evidence that can be evaluated by science
3509384 god is impervious to all arguments against him thats why hes god how convenient
3509385 one time events that are buried in the past may or may not leave traces of evidence that can be evaluated by science
3509386 our current technological level might not make it possible for us to make meaningful observations on the subject
3509387 the problem of whether or not there was a virgin birth
3509388 complaining that there is this nuisance problem of induction floating around in our philosophies and scientification does not imply that religion has any validity
3509389 i have no problem with that as long as it is recognized to be a philosophical position not a scientific one
3509390 ultimately it says nothing more about the truth of those claims than it says about their falsity
3509391 and that is not the claim the claim is that said palestinian female was impregnated by a supernatural being
3509392 talking point youve seized on is neither reasonable meaningful nor coherent given your previous behavior towards incorrect arguments i expect you to cling to it to your dying breath 144
3509393 you really do think all of human reasoning is an arbitrary game purposely set up to deny the existence of your absurd faith
3509394 the impregnating of a human female by a supernatural being is by definition incoherent and thereby impossible qed and by the way anyone who could even entertain such a notion is mentally defective unlike caledonian
3509395 the observation identification description experimental investigation and theoretical explanation of phenomena
3509396 the impregnating of a human female by a supernatural being is by definition incoherent and thereby impossible qed and by the way anyone who could even entertain such a notion is mentally defective unlike caledonian
3509397 i now know how to do this or that technique
3509398 where are the definitions that operationalize a distinction between the natural and supernatural ramsey youve had several oppportunities
3509399 it is impossible for anyone to dispel his fear over the most imporant matters if he does not know what is the nature of the universe but instead suspects something that happens in myth therefore it is impossible to obtain unmitigated pleasure without natural science
3509400 now where are those definitions they are not contained in either of your links
3509401 if the universe is actually unlawful any pattern discoverable is potentially a whim
3509402 the presence or absence of a god s fundamentally changes the nature of the universe
3509403 i believe that you are saying that logic alone doesnt suffice to exclude impossible worlds in a multiverse setting
3509404 tegmarks ensemble theory is afaik not closed because g dels incompleteness theorems allow introducing ever more axioms as needed to describe encountered unprovable mathematical theorems within a formal theory
3509405 on the other hand i think the possible infiniteness in structure of a natural multiverse further support the improbability of a supernatural explanation by removing all need but that is me
3509406 so any unlawful nonnatural event would show up as changes in fundamental laws or their parameters whatever they turn out to be and or massenergy of a system would not add up
3509407 yes or at least not any logic that is constrained to a number of dimensions less than those proposed to exist
3509408 an episode on flatland or how a plain folk discovered the third dimension
3509409 if the probability of a multiverse can be inferred from an experimental verification of some unique prediction of some version of string theory then i think by extension the existence of the supernatural becomes falsifiable or even false
3509410 but symmetry might still be rescued by appealing to a very large number of less dramatic events elsewhere
3509411 non physical non quantum spooky action at a distance correlations of some sort
3509412 im just pointing out why a supposed dramatic symmetry breaking event would not count as a demonstration that naturalism is false
3509413 he needs to know the gravity of the situation and having been at the water treatment plant hell know the nature of the problem

3509454 would not be in the best interest of the community
3509455 she was very pleased at the division of paroles decision
3509456 clearly both in the screening that in the confirmation the presence of recombinant epo
3509457 clearly and without ambiguity that urine a 2257932 contains recombinant epo
3509458 the opinion of the second laboratory for the evaluation of the results indicates that the results of the analysis for the rhepo are inconclusive
3509459 this is a second laboratory namely the australian sports drug testing laboratory in sydney
3509460 clearly and without ambiguity that urine contains b 2257932 recombinant epo
3509461 as conservatoire to the cas against the decision on october 19 2007 by the national committee the rfec tas 2007 a 1444
3509462 is a prohibited substance on the prohibited list in the class
3509463 the analysis revealed b1 does not therefore the absence of epo recombinant but his presence but with a lack of certainty
3509464 the uci therefore supports the analysis that b1 was not completed and that and was to continue with an analysis b2 to have a successful outcome for the analysis of sample b
3509465 it would be inconsistent with the mission combat doping will not use another aliquot allowing where appropriate when an audit conclusive analysis of a first aliquot was not conclusively
3509466 and if the cas came to believe that analyses a b 1 and b 2 does not constitute proof of the regular presence of recombinant epo in the sample charged with mr
3509467 the uci relies on the use or attempted use of a prohibited substance or method the meaning of article 15
3509468 for example use may be based on reliable analytical data from analysis of a sample a without the analysis of the b sample confirms or analysis of a sample b only when the anti doping organization provides an explanation satisfactory to the absence of confirmation by another sample
3509469 training considers that regulations and standards international laboratories have been met and that the repetition of the analysis the b sample is valid the uci and the rfec can not take into account the outcome more favourable for the cyclist
3509470 the attached file 26 07 corresponding to mr iban mayo diez
3509471 may refer the matter to cas so that the latter as supervisor of this committee in this field could revoke if necessary decision of this disciplinary body
3509472 the training may at any time if it deems useful to complement the presentations of the parties require production of documents further order the hearing of witnesses commit and hear experts or carry out any other act of instruction
3509473 the burden of proof to the uci and its national federations who will establish the existence of a breach of doping
3509474 the laboratories will carry out analysis of samples taken during doping controls and will report the results in accordance with the standards international laboratories wada
3509475 wada accredited laboratories are presumed to have carried out the analysis of samples and complied with the procedures of the security chain in accordance with international standards for laboratories
3509476 report of a laboratory or another body empowered to make analyses revealed the presence in a sample a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers including high amounts of endogenous substances or the use of a prohibited method
3509477 focus isoelectric and double immunoblotting ief and double blotting for the analysis of sample a it is come to the conclusion that it contained recombinant epo a second option issued by the lausanne laboratory confirmed this conclusion
3509478 the main purpose of standards international monitoring is to plan effective checks and preserve the integrity and the identity of samples from the notification sportsman until transport of samples the laboratory
3509479 in addition one of the priority objectives of the sil and cis is to ensure best possible security for the transport of samples and their documentation
3509480 the transport begins as samples and sealed their documentation leave the doping control and ends with the confirmation that the samples and their documentation arrived at their destination
3509481 do not so imperative that the packaging used for transporting samples and documentation are themselves sealed
3509482 presumptive identification a screening procedure a prohibited substance metabolite s partner s or marker s indicating the use of a prohibited substance or a prohibited method must be confirmed on a second aliquot taken from the sample
3509483 clearly both in the screening that in the confirmation the presence of epo recombinant
3509484 clearly and without ambiguity that urine contains a 2257932 epo recombinant
3509485 we have accepted that this piece is part of the procedure i have a doubt
3509486 to ensure the production laboratories analytical results and valid data as evidence
3509487 if the analysis of the b sample is negative control as a whole will be considered negative and the rider his national federation national anti doping and wada will be informed
3509488 for the adverse analytical finding is valid the result for the sample
3509489 if the analysis of the b sample is negative control as a whole will be considered negative
3509490 as rightly pointed iban mayo diez an analysis of doping control ends by drafting and dispatch by the laboratory a certificate or analysis report
3509491 the laboratory must have a policy defining the circumstances in which it is allowed to repeat the analysis confirmation of a sample
3509492 this clearly opens the door to repetition of an analysis of the b sample or even multiple repetitions
3509493 while still a residual urine sufficient to charge a party aliquot its purpose is essentially viterdes situations where problems techniques which would occur during an analysis would prevent the completion or good realization thereof
3509494 the request analysis of sample b of the national federation must be sent to the laboratory at least 5 five days after receipt of the letter to the federations national runner bearing communication of adverse analytical finding of the a sample
3509495 the presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites markers in body fluids of the respondent
3509496 the suspension period will begin on the date of the decision of the hearing body or in case waiving the hearing the date when the suspension was imposed or accepted

3509539 ironically the raids detentions and deportations presented by ice as a comprehensive approach to battle violence are in reality violent actions that spread panic and intimidation furthermore they systematically break the human and civil rights of the immigrant community we can not continue living in a state of fear it is urgent that the us a country that presents itself as a strong democracy guarantees human rights that are essential to democracy including the rights to human freedom and mobility

3509560 this is an unbelievable letdown i kind of saw it coming but i never expected the architecture review board arb to fail on such an immense scale
3509561 i find it astonishing how far some people can be removed from reality and yet not be immediately fired due to overwhelming incompetence this is the death of modern opengl thank you very much what microsoft never managed you did
3509562 opengl 3 0 is a significant evolutionary step that integrates new functionality to ensure that opengl is a truly state of the art graphics api while supporting a broad swathe of existing hardware
3509563 just as importantly opengl 3 0 sets the stage for a revolution to come we now have the roadmap machinery and momentum in place to rapidly and reliably develop opengl and are working closely with opencl to ensure that opengl plays a pivotal role in the ongoing revolution in programmable visual computing

3509592 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting
3509593 the best way to stop counterfeiting is ongoing collaboration between companies government agencies and law enforcement
3509594 we have a very strong suspicion that the government was losing every motion pierce was arguing every motion on behalf of the plaintiffs and they may have felt a need to somehow reverse that trend

3509692 we hold on to it and it sits in our desk drawer and it depreciates and in the end it ends up in the landfill
3509693 a bureaucrat is the most despicable of men though he is needed as vultures are needed but one hardly admires vultures whom bureaucrats so strangely resemble i have yet to meet a bureaucrat who was not petty dull almost witless crafty or stupid an oppressor or a thief a holder of little authority in which he delights as a boy delights in possessing a vicious dog who can trust such creatures

3509697 we hope that theyll be a real part of our community
3509698 sharing all of the intellectual aspects of what goes on so that means working with us developing new technologies and passing it on to our students as well
3509699 theres the robotics institute where we are now the entertainment technology center which was co founded by randy pausch who did work at disney imagineering at one time
3509700 disney i think has a big place in everybodys hearts that grew up in the country and grew up with those movies so its very exciting
3509701 we have found that consumers are becoming more educated and are looking beyond the megapixel when purchasing a digital camera

3509704 this isnt the time to say i told you so
3509705 weve worked well and its a nice feeling where we are at the moment but theres no euphoria or feeling of told you so there is a much bigger prize
3509706 if we can beat canberra then the play offs are achievable
3509707 i have never felt anything other than what i thought was needed in terms of retaining or attaining the players we have
3509708 im not going to comment on whether brian smith has been vindicated for the changes he made last season
3509709 last year was last year and i will always want the knights to be successful but theres a right and wrong way of doing things and i think the way things were done last year was not right you cant help but put a lot of their success down to the form of kurt gidley and danny buderus
3509710 the decision to re sign kurt gidley early in the season has been the signing of the season
3509711 since chief executive steve burraston locked him up after round one or two he has improved out of sight
3509712 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3509713 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3509714 go back to making tea for brian mulroney and stay out of serious peoples business
3509715 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3509716 if liberal mps are allowed to publicly use offensive language like thibaults without consequence it shows that stephane dions commitment to women in politics rings hollow
3509717 begs the question does stephane dion believe the best use of womans talent is making tea
3509718 its the kind of negative thing that gets a lot of publicity so it needs a strong reaction
3509719 otherwise a lot of women are sitting there saying why would i want to get into that kind of macho schoolyard boys game
3509720 thibault issued the apology on his own dion did not need to talk to him we consider the matter closed
3509721 in katelynns death shes speaking out to us to ask us to end violence and addiction and abuse
3509722 we cant forget to forget is to not do anything and something has to be done to stop this type of stuff from happening
3509723 we have done so to strengthen democracy in the country
3509724 impeachment proceedings are a right of the parliament it cannot be challenged in any court and any such interference would be an infringement upon the sovereignty of the parliament and the constitution
3509725 its not the first time this happens its not unusual for us to study the scene before seeing the people involved in the shooting
3509726 what happened in the riot is one hundredth of what should happen what will happen
3509727 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3509728 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3509729 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3509730 on saturday the cops overreact and shoot three young guys who did nothing wrong on sunday they do nothing while this happens
3509731 i heard my brother say what are you doing to my brother and then i heard gunshots
3509732 my brother tried to help me and now hes dead
3509733 se solo fosse vero spiegherei le ali e spiccherei il volo ma ho paura paura di cadere e anche se non cadessi potrebbe venire qualcuno ad abbattermi
3509734 e ti sembra che la paura di fallire valga una vita in questo nido valga una vita monotona e piena di paure una vita non goduta
3509735 sei sicuro che non sai oppure non vuoi sapere la risposta alla mia domanda
3509736 we hate each other thats pretty much it its a great rivalry its going to be a great game and its the olympics so it just raises the bar that much more
3509737 dont write that thats a lie we love each other
3509738 no its a big rivalry obviously we play each other so often we know everything about each other so its going to be a little catty but its always a great game in the end
3509739 its a huge rivalry between them and us we get excited to play the u s all the time and now we get to do it in the olympics
3509740 obviously it would be ideal to knock them out in the olympics and not allow them a chance to win a medal
3509741 we hope were the big story of the games no canadian athletes have won a medal and we would like to win our next game and give us a pretty good shot at it
3509742 before we can look at that we have to focus on the u s and theyre probably the best team in the world we still have to beat them
3509743 you become rivals especially with how much we play them
3509744 since ive been on the team we havent beaten or tied the states so its always a match i look forward to because this is it every time and this is it its time
3509745 weve been a growing program were becoming better funded our country is behind us we really dont have any excuses
3509746 its growing in canada its a huge sport now and its time we start contending and we have been doing that for the majority of times but every now and then they give us a good spanking to remind us we still have a ways to go
3509747 weve made major strides already by getting to the olympic games quarter finals its a fantastic accomplishment
3509748 i dont think the players are happy or pleased with that still i think they are really eager to keep moving into the semis that would be a major accomplishment
3509749 i just love scoring no matter what no matter where it is so scoring a goal in the olympics against a team like sweden is just a huge feat for me
3509750 the results were below our estimate of 4 and the consensus
3509751 eh im not sure if i would find anything cool at something like that

3509768 cette journ e est la plus belle de ma vie
3509769 ah bon mais cest interdit en vertu de quoi il y a une loi vous avez une l gitimit me casser mon sourire et ma bonne humeur sale vilain petit bouquiniste de pacotille vous navez rien dautre faire que surveiller les gens qui passent et qui prennent des photos en plan large que a peut bien vous faire que vous craignez je nallais pas acheter une de vos crottes de toute fa on que vous croyez vous pensez tre le grand manitou des bords de seine mais laissez moi vous dire que je vous m prise de toute ma faible force jesp re que mon regard vous la bien laiss entendre parce que tout ce qui pr c de est sous entendu dans lintonation dun simple
3509770 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3509771 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3509772 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3509773 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3509774 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3509775 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3509776 it was a dream come true just to race here
3509777 was to reach over the table and punch the doctor who was giving me the news
3509778 if certain tests had come back elevated my parents would have stepped in
3509779 sense of a prehistoric world of immense spans of time was first stimulated by ferns and fossil ferns
3509780 the young fronds release hydrogen cyanide as soon as the insects mandible tears into them and if this does not kill or deter the bug a much crueler poison lies in store brackens more than any other plants are loaded with hormones called ecdysones and when these are ingested by insects they cause uncontrollable molting
3509781 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3509782 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment please leave me alone
3509783 acredito que haver um telefonema em algum momento ainda hoje
3509784 my heart stopped for seven minutes the doctors couldnt believe it they say if your heart stops like that youre supposed to die but im still here so im happy
3509785 it was really hard watching him seeing him lying in that hospital bed like he was dead
3509786 my doctor says i need therapy because my mind is a little confused i dont know why i dont understand myself
3509787 thats why im still alive god gave me a chance
3509788 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3509789 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3509790 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3509791 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3509792 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3509793 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3509794 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3509795 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3509796 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds
3509797 the key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities and with the computing resources we have at purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty
3509798 we couldnt have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available
3509799 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3509800 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3509801 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3509802 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3509803 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3509804 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3509805 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3509806 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3509807 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage
3509808 ultimately we could also find out how massage helps not just exercise induced muscle injury but swelling and pain associated with other medical conditions as well
3509809 intinya industri migas nasional yang saat ini telah berumur 130 tahun harus ditangani oleh bangsa sendiri caranya bisa dengan nasionalisasi atau apapun namanya
3509810 pengamat energi dari amerika serikat bahkan meramalkan pada 2012 hampir seluruh tambang migas di dunia sudah dikelola oleh bangsanya sendiri
3509811 sekitar 80 persen produksi minyak nasional masih didominasi perusahaan migas asing
3509812 sebanyak 90 persen belanja sektor migas yang rp 100 triliun per tahun juga didominasi jasa dan barang asing
3509813 dengan dasar asumsi itu maka bayar saja asing yang produksi totalnya saat ini sekitar 700 ribu bph itu untuk membayar perusahaan asing yang dinasionalisasi maka masih berpotensi untung lebih dari 700 miliar dolar as
3509814 it is not a one on one matter i was made chief minister by all the allies of the upa and any decision on it should be taken by the coalition
3509815 besides the upas central leadership other mlas and ministers will have to sit together to reach a conclusion
3509816 if the basis of the round doha negotiations initiated seven years ago has to see a change in its very objectives it would be a tough going for global trade integration
3509817 it cannot be expected to accept the flaws the price developing countries are being asked to pay for developed countries to cut subsidies
3509818 my simple message here in delhi and next week in washington is that members should look carefully at what is on the table and not on results listen to all wto members and efforts should be to conclude the talks
3509819 the good news is there may be still a possibility to move this forward and conclude negotiations within the time frame that is end 2008
3509820 the u s will be able to spend much more on subsidies
3509821 one of the reasons for decline in production is the trade distorting subsidies and high tariffs in the rich countries
3509822 if the eu says we are going to reduce tariffs for airplanes what does it mean for india and africa
3509823 i want to import cotton from africa but if there is 40 per cent subsidy in the u s my industry is not going to buy it from africa
3509824 i would have thought cotton would have become a goodwill case cotton must be tackled seriously

3509826 after we received information that he has been detained in jeddah airport we approached the saudi authorities telephonically as well as through other modes of communication to confirm the detention we have not received any information yet
3509827 i have sympathy for the problems of the third world but i dont believe violence and thievery are the answer
3509828 they wanted dollars but we only had a few quetzales with us on the boat
3509829 this case is a particularly tragic one when you look at the people involved
3509830 this is the kind of assistance we are receiving now
3509831 i dont want to name names even though he probably deserves it but he fooled around
3509832 oh yeah and lied it was one of those things that everyone knew but me he was a good liar nobody would come out and tell me and he seemed perfect in every way
3509833 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3509834 i had just watched scarface and i dont think i spoke
3509835 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true its like oh yeah im telling you
3509836 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3509837 the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people
3509838 our lockers are right next to each other im here if he needs me if he has any questions he knows who to ask
3509839 hes been the only guy whos ever thrown the ball to me for eight years
3509840 my main job is to keep his smile on keep him happy
3509841 every now and then you can come to a situation like this and lose your focus bretts handling it well hes starting to have fun out there
3509842 i think the main thing is he finally understands the offense
3509843 hes only been here three days and guys are starting to realize why hes brett favre hes done some good things in three days i told them to just wait until he gets comfortable then theyll see
3509844 life is all about how you deal with the curveballs that come your way
3509845 we do know that with the pollution aspect industry has been closed down weve heard that industry as far away as 15 to 1600 kilometres from beijing has been shut down and that includes the wool processing areas
3509846 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3509847 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3509848 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3509849 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3509850 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3509851 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3509852 weve been doing it here for 100 years well no 37
3509853 ill bet its something alice waters picked up in france

3509899 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such treatments would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
3509900 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3509901 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3509902 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3509903 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3509904 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3509905 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3509906 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3509907 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3509908 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds
3509909 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3509910 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3509911 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3509912 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3509913 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3509914 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3509915 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3509916 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3509917 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage

3509922 no no they are not and furthermore that is not the main issue you are missing the plank in your eye doug here is the issue you repent turn away from your sins whether you think they are petty or huge and you lose your life and you cast off your trust in yourself you turn to me jesus

3509948 meteen na de wedstrijd was ik wat ontgoocheld maar nadat ik alles wat liet bezinken besefte ik dat ik het fantastisch heb gedaan ik had me vooraf als doelstelling een top 10 plaats vooropgesteld maar als je na de dressuur op een tweede plaats staat dan begin je soms net iets teveel te dromen
3509949 ik reed de beste dressuur in mijn leven stond dan ook tweede in de tussenstand op de olympische spelen en zowel ik als de media zijn dan veel te veel verwachtingen gaan koesteren ik had vooraf zeker getekend voor een plaats in de top tien en dan is een negende plaats fantastisch deze eventingcompetitie was aan de top van de rangschikking van zeer hoog niveau
3509950 er werd veel beter gesprongen in de jumping dan gewoonlijk als ik twee keer foutloos was gebleven in de jumping had ik een medaille kunnen veroveren maar als ik realistisch ben was die kans klein en achteraf kan je allerlei veronderstellingen maken ik heb mezelf niets te verwijten ik heb n foutje gemaakt in de eerste jumpingproef maar dat is alles wat ik me kan verwijten ik ben blij dat het voorbij is dit is voor mij n van de mooiste kampioenschappen
3509951 ik heb weinig fouten gemaakt het is fantastisch geweest en dat gevoel zal ik overhouden aan de olympische spelen ik wil ook iedereen bedanken die zo hard voor me heeft gesupporterd ik kijk nu al uit naar de olympische spelen van londen 2012 waar ik opnieuw zal proberen een medaille te halen

3509972 several bothersome headlines related to major financial firms have tempered some of the bullish enthusiasm
3509973 in particular jpmorgan chase said it has incurred roughly 1 5 billion dollars in losses so far this quarter as trading conditions have deteriorated substantially
3509974 with economic indicators showing a greater likelihood of recession we anticipate lower earnings through early 2009 due to further credit weakness in housing and investor real estate as well as some decline in the retail and consumer sectors
