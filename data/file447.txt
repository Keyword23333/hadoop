4470018 prior to pasteurization requirements there were a number of deaths associated with milk borne bacteria e g tuberculosis causing fatal infections
4470019 milk is a very good medium for bacteria to grow and prior to pasteurization becoming compulsory milk was implicated in many food poisoning incidents
4470020 pasteurized milk as a vehicle of infection in an outbreak of listeriosis
4470021 massive outbreak of antimicrobial resistant salmonellosis traced to pasteurized milk
4470022 theyre going to be hanging over the back of our house and now theres the medical thing

4470029 this will make any hope of cooperative effort on iran much more difficult
4470030 the last serious issue where the bush administration has decisions to make in terms of changing policy
4470031 the one place of high national security interest to the united states where russia plays a direct role in what we are trying to do in that sense it towers over all these other things
4470032 this has come at a very opportune time for iran
4470033 any new rift between the us and russians would be welcome by iran anything that give iran more time and a little more headache for the us
4470034 up to a point iran would be quietly happy but the conflict can escalate to something that would cause more instability and suffering
4470035 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims
4470036 some of our partners far from assisting us are attempting to impede us by transferring georgian troops on board us aircraft directly to the conflict zone
4470037 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
4470038 georgia is a marginal issue to the united states iran is a central issue
4470039 seriously limit its response to georgia to avoid a russian counter in iran
4470040 even if there are no more un sanctions on iran at least there can still be more us and european sanctions
4470041 nuclear and missile entities used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
4470042 i think russia has been playing us when it comes to sanctions and stringing it out for years and years
4470043 theyve never wanted sanctions and our position has moved to theirs not vice versa if you go back 12 years ago we were debating whether there should be a bushehr nuclear reactor now we are well beyond that today
4470044 google has unblocked scamp the uks most popular advertising industry blog following the removal of comments containing
4470045 who in an ad agency you would prefer to date
4470046 along the lines of how they would rather have sex with someone with downs syndrome than an advertising professional
4470047 a lot of people were offended but i decided not to delete the comment
4470048 my policy is i do delete comments where the commenter is intending to be offensive but i dont delete comments where the commenters primary intention is to be witty even if what they say ends up offending people
4470049 ive deleted all the comments on here relating to sex with people who have downs syndrome
4470050 although google havent informed me exactly which post on this blog caused the activation of their hate crimes division the strength of feeling in the comments section here leads me to believe it was this one
4470051 the acquisition of pixer technology is a further step in carl zeiss smt s long term strategy to widen its technology portfolio by offering innovative products to enable advanced semiconductor manufacturing
4470052 wage exploitation resulting from unfair or non existent contracts and the denial of basic public social services
4470053 there is substantial evidence that road building might be able to ameliorate the tension of transportation demand in a short run but it might not be true from a long term perspective
4470054 the state government has been propping up other uneconomic venues since the olympics to the amount of about 46 million a year
4470055 football soccer wont go there because the seats are too far away and a closer look at the drawings reveals it would be impossible to shrink the roof down to cover the permanent seating begging the question of who would want to take on an open air stadium in our climate
4470056 it was illegal to borrow this money from bank of uganda
4470057 you have only 24 four hours to provide us with the parliamentary approval because as far as we are concerned this money was used behind our back
4470058 there is a lot of suspicion as regards this deal and as a committee we shall prove to you that this was a conduit to defraud public funds
4470059 we acquired this loan because it was inevitable at the time we didnt have funds yet the president had to execute his duties
4470060 we didnt go to bank of uganda we went to the ministry of finance and we dont owe anything to bank of uganda
4470061 just found out that proposed city budget cuts include measures that will gut the municipal forestry program for ft

4470065 partnering with sematech is a win win situation for both organizations
4470066 the combination of umcs 300mm manufacturing experience and process technology expertise and sematechs wealth of knowledge in the field of semiconductor r amp d will help the industry better handle the challenges of migration to next generation processes we are excited about sematechs commitment to 300mm exploratory research and development and look forward to passing the benefits of this technology relationship to our customers
4470067 our members join me in welcoming umc to sematech and we look forward to their contributions and technical insight from their perspective as a global leader in 300mm foundry services umc will be an important partner in accelerating the progress of r amp d innovations into manufacturing solutions
4470068 we dont have one single club where either every customer smokes or no customer smokes
4470069 its money out of their cash register either way they go and thats why they dont want to be the one to make the statement
4470070 there are just a myriad of things that have no focus at this point and we have no idea what the committee is writing but were going to submit the issues that we think are important to us and would definitely impact our business
4470071 its not appropriate for me to lump all of my members into a blanket statement
4470072 i think were all convinced that its probably going to happen
4470073 if it has to happen we want to be on the inside track and have some say in the writing of the laws to help protect our smoking customers
4470074 my position really hasnt changed any as far as being adamantly opposed to the whole thing but this will at least give me an opportunity to have my concerns presented through an organization of other bars
4470075 it may carry a little bit more weight than speaking on my own behalf
4470076 david just did his interview on the radio 98 6 wichita that he was supposed to do yesterday he apologized and said he didnt know he was suppposed to call in yesterday sounds like he had alot of other things going on btw he said he just got to ny while the others went on to kentucky for the next show he will be flying there tonight i guess he might be working on the album in ny
4470077 david adroitly walks the line between giving his core fans their fill of vocal runs while showing enough restraint that he wont automatically alienate non idol loving listeners
4470078 just listened to the thing six times in a row and were not terribly angry about spin seven
4470079 david fills a spot where theres a void he has innocence and humility
4470080 the mautner project improves the health of lesbians bisexual and transgender women who partner with women and their families through advocacy education research and direct service the mautner project envisions a healthcare system that is guided by social justice and responsive to the needs of all people

4470083 rubicon aggressively ramped 6 inch sapphire substrates to support our high volume production requirements throughout 2007 and the first half of 2008
4470084 last year we nearly tripled our unit volume with key design wins in the rapidly growing wireless marketplace in some of the worlds most demanding rf applications as we migrate to 8 inch wafers and smaller geometries our customers will benefit from unprecedented product performance and cost effectiveness
4470085 the nature of the programme is such that we cannot reveal who is going to participate
4470086 families who were evicted from public buildings live in cramped tents and caravans
4470087 hes burning fumes from gasoline he knows too much you cant tell him anything
4470088 tell me why he cant tell me how high is the sky
4470089 not understood but has to be implemented to stay competitive
4470090 encapsulating application logic within atomic services that interact via a common communications protocol
4470091 to be honest this third party tool is better than microsofts
4470092 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry
4470093 recalled his wife aliza chameides who did not object as long as the project didnt affect her
4470094 most people are like if its under your sink for a week you dont want it there
4470095 ive never heard of anyone wanting to save that stuff
4470096 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry
4470097 recalled his wife aliza chameides who did not object as long as the project didnt affect her
4470098 most people are like if its under your sink for a week you dont want it there
4470099 ive never heard of anyone wanting to save that stuff
4470100 if i had totally thought it through i might not have done it
4470101 i never feel like i was being preached to with dave its like learn by example
4470102 california man saves all of his trash for one year
4470103 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4470104 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4470105 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4470106 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4470107 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4470108 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4470109 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4470110 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4470111 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4470112 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4470113 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4470114 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
4470115 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4470116 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4470117 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4470118 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4470119 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries
4470120 a lot of the troops here are on the fence or disappointed
4470121 once youre knowledgeable and start observing the people you want to reach opportunities will almost immediately present themselves on how you can engage with them
4470122 what they are looking for is others who can help them do things better more efficiently
4470123 youre there to be a resource for them and to introduce them to things that dont in any way shape or form come across as a sales opp or marketing opp or pitch
4470124 your volleyball season is about to start and i know you want to learn the secrets of how the pros play like they do strengthen and improve your volleyball skills while playing for your high school and club team now learn early what indoor and beach volleyball olympians and professionals know about 1 the importance of gaining muscle strength for injury prevention gaining speed and increasing your vertical jump while training for volleyball 3 mental conditioning and gaining confidence in yourself and your game on and off the court

4470126 its about understanding how to use the web to get your message out there and get your supporters to distribute it for you
4470127 this is the home page this is where were greeting people
4470128 do you think these guys could make eye contact with us no
4470129 hes using lots of different type faces at all different sizes which gives you a feeling of chaos
4470130 obamas then goes on to do what mccains doesnt which is to provide his supporters this whole infrastructure to organize themselves to do things that are going to help get obama elected and mccains just doesnt do that
4470131 it allows everybody who wants to do something to put their thing out there and see if people get excited about it
4470132 building communities online takes time and building strong robust web sites also takes time so its kind of like getting a 747 to take off from a small regional airport there aint enough runway
4470133 i dont think you can get elected president of the united states without using the internet but youre certainly not going to get elected president of the united states with it alone
4470134 the future of computing and consumer devices is increasingly visual and bandwidth intensive

4470136 their attacks on schools teachers and others working on education are systematic not random
4470137 they are part of a deliberate attack on human rights on equality for women and on any attempt by their to control their own destiny
4470138 there must be an end to impunity for those who attack schools students and educators
4470139 intensify efforts to put an end to the growing pattern of attacks

4470146 ive always been very much into constitutional rights and gun rights
4470147 it seems retarded that you cant protect yourself on an open campus its ridiculous
4470148 people think were trying to force guns everywhere and its going to be a bloodbath but thats not the case
4470149 i dont have a lot of confidence that a college kid with a gun or any untrained person for that matter will get into a successful shootout with a bad guy
4470150 this is one of the craziest ideas anyone has ever thought of
4470151 the permit holder might be the all american kid who has never done anything wrong in his or her life
4470152 but what if they live in the dorms the roommate might be a moron
4470153 its unfortunate but when a kid goes on campus and starts shooting it gives attention to our cause
4470154 even the president has said it isnt a quick fix i cant allow a hoax to come to the floor
4470155 in the context of a fuller more comprehensive energy package
4470156 not pass their royalties to the taxpayer they want us to subsidize the drilling

4470167 i think we are close to doing something with robbie
4470168 ive said all along that he has to get his fitness and sharpness and we are now seeing good signs of that
4470169 in the last three or four days in training hes been absolutely different class
4470170 hes a world class striker and if he can get fit and sharp then he will always score goals at any level ill sit down with the chairman now and discuss where we are going to go from here
4470171 youve seen all the stuff in the papers and i havent got to say what the situation is
4470172 stephen warnock has come back and said he had no intention of putting a transfer request in
4470173 as for roque he has said he wants to stay
4470174 the surprise was not so much that the next move in rates is likely to be down that has been our forecast for some time but that the central bank seems happy to nurture this expectation
4470175 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive cooperation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive cooperation for the future
4470176 we will not give up bank secrecy but we are willing to collaborate with other nations when it comes to the misuse of bank secrecy laws for tax evasion

4470185 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
4470186 lets not center the environmental movement around global warming if we do then every time the thermometer drops well have people thinking that the environment doesnt matter anymore
4470187 a few problems with this article first phil chapman did not present at nor even participated in the conference described in the article
4470188 the world cooled quickly between january last year and january this year by about 0 7c
4470189 the global annual temperature for combined land and ocean surfaces in 2007 was 0 55 c 0 99 f above the 20th century average ranking 5th warmest in the period of record
4470190 theres a reason why cancer rates have been spiking over the last couple of decades were now living in our own filth
4470191 i just think its funny that gore who is so worried about gw lives in a house that expends more energy than 20 times the national norm is he really that worried

4470194 theyre talking about eliminating three billion people in the world and 100 million americans before the end of 2050
4470195 discussions between ofcom and channel continue and they are continuing to investigate this sounds like trouble making by a third party to me
4470196 as part of an independent investigation into the 2005 british comedy awards commissioned by itv olswang identified that the second part of the 2004 awards was recorded and then broadcast as live
4470197 this information was passed to ofcom as part of our ongoing co operation with their investigation into the 2005 awards
4470198 unfortunately we scoured the country for any disabled athlete who may have been able to participate in the games
4470199 while we very much wanted to participate in the games we discovered that our practice of aborting imperfect chinese offspring limited this capability we simply do not have anything other than perfect physical specimens to represent the motherland
4470200 we sincerely thought they would be able to come up with a team by now i know they had taken to feeding a group of ethnic muslim children lead tainted toys in order to try to prepare a track and field team
4470201 frankly i dont see why a country that we knew was going to have such a difficult time even fielding any female teams would win the bid for any kind of olympics
4470202 likes attending fancy shindigs and events is still thinking about their best party idea ever

4470226 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4470227 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population

4470233 for those who respect free living animals its simply not enough to express outrage at the proposed shooting of horses we need to end the cycle of violence its high time we acknowledge the connection between horsemeat and hamburgers
4470234 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated
4470235 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated
4470236 in the end we will protect and conserve only that which we love we will love only that which we understand and we will understand only that which we are taught
4470237 the only thing left living will be the wolves and then they will die off and then nothing
4470238 were talking about a revolution challenging centuries of domination and starting with our next meal
4470239 by becoming vegan we work at the roots to refresh our world ensuring respect and indeed a future for our planet and all of its inhabitants
4470240 figured it was about time to do an update so here is what we been up to
4470241 we want emma and jackson to have a happy life
4470242 well always miss them but were confident they will enjoy a place of permanent safety
4470243 we also believe that reaching a settlement agreement allows us to move ahead and foster harmony in the sanctuary community
4470244 their distinctive singing is an important way for gibbons to interact as a solo the song of a gibbon is a very lonely sound
4470245 were very glad to welcome jos maria junior and scoshio back to primarily primates where newly expanded living spaces await them and a lot of love and caring is in store for them
4470246 a protracted case in court that is expensive and debilitating for everybody
4470247 we hope to see you all soon as we start the tour august 30th in sweden keep checking our to see if we play near you
4470248 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4470249 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know sh they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4470250 i guess over the last few years weve kind of drifted into each others circles again myself guitarist bill steer and mike and mikes kind of i dont want to over exaggerate this but hes always been the keenest to do this because since he formed arch enemy and has been out on the road again hes kind of realized what kind of phenomenon carcass is
4470251 mikes always been kind of hassling me and bill on the side about doing something and so i guess the stars aligned at some point because for years i said id never do it if drummer ken owen who suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1999 couldnt play i thought it would be a bit like led zeppelin playing without john bonham how can you kind of find a way around that
4470252 it seems to me nostalgia is the new rock and roll not to sound arrogant but im well aware of the importance of this band even if no one else is theres a generation of people who were into carcass whove grown up now that never saw the band and now they have some disposable income theyve created the demand for this reunion
4470253 scoshio and junior are a bit camera shy but weve managed to get some good shots of them they ate grapes out of my hand but werent too keen on banana junior knows his name and came running up to me when i called it
4470254 they played with all of the hanging structures in their enclosures and spent a few moments in the blue barrel pondering their next moves
4470255 jos mar a is just the most amazing little guy
4470256 so i spoke a little spanish to him with a proper name like that how could i resist he understood of course thats all i spoke to him thereafter his response was just incredible
4470257 he has such wonderful character he loves the grass as well they all do but he spent more time on it than the other three he ran more than he swung and sat on the ground more than on the hanging structures he has quite an appetite as well he ate all of the grapes we gave him and a banana and still wanted more all of that in addition to finishing the late supper maggie and tracey gave him last night of the four he is the most people oriented
4470258 but soon as we stepped away for a moment to see chimpanzees deeter and jewel they all started singing non stop for about 10 minutes i had never heard gibbons sing and it was just beautiful the intern watching them through elenas vacation said they had been singing all morning they must feel at home the appetites are good theyre singing and playing
4470259 we muslims believe in all the prophets as well as jesus
4470260 to believe in all the prophets and holy books that allah has sent us is one of the principle beliefs in the religion of islam
4470261 i am very glad that muslims accept all the holy books this belief gives us a great deal of common ground to stand upon
4470262 the almighty and the majestic allah may he be glorified and exalted states in his holy quran say he allah is one
4470263 while the three god the messiah and the spirit of god are mentioned in both the old and new testaments the description of god as one god who eternally exists as three persons god the father god the son and god the holy spirit is not taught specifically in the scriptures as you have correctly concluded
4470264 the doctrine was first introduced from clements school of theology in alexandria egypt at the end of the second century and was not made the official
4470265 the apostle paul was a jew and a monotheist who taught that
4470266 actually the first century church believed in one god joined to the messiah jesus by one spirit
4470267 allah instructs us to believe in jesus and the unaltered holy bible that was sent to him and all the other prophets that allah has sent us
4470268 according to islam jesus is one of the great prophets of allah he was born fatherless from the virgin mary jesus was created just as adam was created without a father as a matter of fact todays medical science eases the understanding of this situation allah is bereft of human qualities and having a child god had no partner and he did not beget a son
4470269 christians have not at any time associated god with a partner
4470270 this is blasphemy while jesus said that he was the son of god
4470271 we are dealing here with the issue of inadequate language
4470272 while the scriptures tell us specifically that jesus is not an angel he is referred to as the
4470273 the early christian church believed that while jesus always pre existed within the father as the essence of his being there was a time when his soul or person was brought forth or
4470274 you mentioned that jesus is like adam you are correct jesus beginning is a parallel of the creation of the first man adam was brought forth birthed or begotten from the preexisting substance of the earth god breathed into him the breath of life and adam became a living soul genesis 2 7 and all subsequent life proceeded from the first man jesus person soul or being was brought forth from the preexisting substance of gods spirit prior to his incarnation and god created everything through him by his spirit
4470275 verily allah he is my lord and your lord so worship him that is the straight path
4470276 no a human cannot be a god but god is unlimited and can be
4470277 the quran says that jesus has the ability to create surah 22 6 only allah can create life surah 5 110 jesus takes clay and creates a bird life therefore jesus only shows the same characteristics of allah creating life
4470278 jesus can create by the spirit of god that was in him
4470279 jesus human aspect is always subordinate to the father throughout the scriptures the apostle paul recognized this distinction by addressing god as
4470280 the father is united to the son by his spirit and this is why jesus said
4470281 again jesus has the title in the quran word of god this is also acknowledged by the apostle john in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god john 1 1 jesus is the visible word the revealer and the visible image of the invisible god who is spirit and unapproachable light
4470282 the distorted bible contains many references on the prophethood of jesus
4470283 surely this is the prophet who is to come into the world
4470284 all the verses and similar ones mentioned in the bible clearly show that jesus is a prophet a messenger sent by god but this is contradicted by all the verses stating that jesus is the son of god these are two opposing ideologies this clearly shows that the bible has been distorted the holy quran clearly explains that jesus is a prophet
4470285 the term used in the scriptures that designates jesus as a prophet is son of man
4470286 it was a common term used to designate a prophet of god a prophet of god is a messenger of god and jesus was definitely gods messenger the writer of the book of hebrews says
4470287 the term son of man and son of god are not contradictions but different titles for jesus two functions one as prophet and the other as messiah we know that the quran also calls jesus messiah and prophet recognizing both titles and as a prophet jesus viewed himself as a servant
4470288 the messiah does by no means disdain that he should be a servant of allah an nisa 172 nevertheless not my will but thine be done luke 22 42 even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many matthew 20 28
4470289 we muslims object to the christian belief that there were not any prophets after jesus we believe that muhammad is the last prophet and there would be no more after him
4470290 but christians do acknowledge that there are other prophets after jesus
4470291 as i mentioned previously jesus is a parallel to adam to understand jesus role as messiah and why he was sent to us we must return to adams creation
4470292 in genesis god creates adam from the earth and breathes into him
4470293 adam was forgiven and covered by a sacrifice that was instigated by god
4470294 adam would still have to live with the consequences of his sin as we all do to this day the ground was cursed
4470295 now adams soul is made in the image of god
4470296 god loves his creation and wanted to restore the fellowship that was lost and make a way for the human soul to return to him after the body dies
4470297 the quran says that when jesus soul was placed in marys body gods spirit was breathed in
4470298 there is a distinction that the scriptures make between the spirit the
4470299 jesus said that these verses in the old testament refer to himself
4470300 gods holy spirit animated or gave life to jesus soul
4470301 jesus purpose as messiah is to impart this breath to us and replace the sin contaminated breath of life inherited from adam with a new holy source of animation for our souls that will enable us to enter gods presence when we die
4470302 jesus was manifested to eradicate the control and authority over the lives of the people that had been given to satan through adams disobedience
4470303 as moses was the mediator between god and abrahams seed so jesus is the mediator of the new covenant
4470304 we know that the old testament scriptures prophesize of jesus
4470305 god gave us the scriptures contained in the bible including the gospels as the quran says the old testament outlines the plan and purpose of the messiah the new testament contains the fulfillment
4470306 but we believe that the scriptures in the bible have been corrupted
4470307 the words of the prophet isaiah were also found in the dead sea scrolls and the translation is exactly the same as our copies while there are some translation errors in the new testament we know what they are and in most cases do not affect the original meaning of the texts
4470308 the scriptures were written by forty different authors on three continents
4470309 there are some translation errors we have the manuscripts and all four thousand of them have been diligently compared over the years by many scholars
4470310 in this passage the apostle john is talking about that which bears witness to messiah
4470311 the apostle john was an eyewitness to jesus crucifixion he saw the centurion pierce jesus side and he saw what he thought was water pour out with the blood
4470312 immediately after jesus resurrection he appeared to his disciples and
4470313 jesus has become our high priest replacing the priests office in the old testament there no longer needs to be any more sacrifices for messiah has made one sacrifice for all time
4470314 messiah jesus is the fulfillment of the plan god instigated from the beginning of time for the redemption of his creation
4470315 the god who said he would be in us and we would be his spiritual sons and daughters is now in us by his spirit through jesus his messiah through repentance and faith in the atonement
4470316 christians have deviated so much with their excessive elevation of jesus that they ignore god and worship jesus instead o people of the scripture jews and christians do not exceed the limits in your religion nor say of allah aught but the truth an nisa 171
4470317 but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises hebrews 8 6
4470318 we worship god through jesus christ and god responds back to us through our priest and intercessor our mediator of the new covenant
4470319 we worship god the father through jesus because like the first century church we recognized that the father is in jesus by his spirit in jesus is the fullness of the godhead bodily
4470320 when jesus role as intercessor and mediator is completed then the scriptures tell us that god will be all in all for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all but jesus and the father are always one and will always be our light and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof revelation 21 23
4470321 the holy spirit that jesus said would come to us the paraklete in the greek which means
4470322 we can see that these scriptures are obviously not talking about muhammad
4470323 while muhammad is obviously not the holy spirit he was raised up to deliver his people from idolatry which he did and to introduce them to jesus and the gospels
4470324 the gospel and all the revelation that has come to you from your lord
4470325 muhammad said that he could not save anyone from hellfire save yourselves from hellfire as i cannot save you from allahs punishment nor do i know what will be done with me or you sahih bukhari vol 4 book 51 16 and the koran sura 46 9
4470326 muhammad said jesus is a prophet and prophets cannot lie jesus said that he could save us from hellfire
4470327 because of jesus a people that knew him not would be able to know god and the gentles would come to god
4470328 as prophesied jesus was to bring the gentiles into the covenant god made with abraham by the atonement which he did
4470329 i hope you are beginning to see the plan in all of this and how jesus role and muhammads purpose fit in the old testament was designed to prophesize the coming messiah the new testament chronicles the fulfillment of those prophecies cumulating in jesus
4470330 muhammad was raised up specifically to deliver ishmaels seed from idolatry and bring them knowledge of jesus
4470331 satan does not want either jews or muslims to enter the covenant and seeks to distort and confuse the doctrines he will try to destroy any doctrine that will destroy him jesus was manifested to destroy the works of the devil through gods chosen plan
4470332 but we do not believe that god would humiliate his prophet on the cross
4470333 if a human father would die to rescue his child or protect his family how much more would god be willing to make a sacrifice of one he loves to save us the creation he loves
4470334 is it impossible for god to accomplish our redemption with an act that human thinking would label as impossible i believe that with god all things are possible
4470335 until now the reintroduction of gray wolves to the northern rockies was one of our greatest endangered species success stories
4470336 now the region has become a killing field for wolves just as we predicted
4470337 dozens of wolves have been killed already and more are certain to die under state laws that in many cases allow unregulated wolf killing anywhere anytime for any reason
4470338 the killing of wolves that have been removed unlawfully from the endangered species list is sufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm
4470339 the killing must stop while the court considers the governments illegal decision to revoke protections in the first place
4470340 the gray wolf simply hasnt recovered yet every animal that falls victim to bait or bullet increases the odds that wolves will slide back toward extinction
4470341 we understand wolf biology behavior and genetics much better than when the original wolf recovery goal was developed more than 20 years ago
4470342 you and your doctor wouldnt make important health decisions based on outdated research yet thats exactly what the federal government has done with wolves
4470343 i feel disappointed and let down by the way the case has been put forward
4470344 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4470345 i think ui s waiting for the kind of ruling they want here and theyre going to start killing these birds right and left
4470346 they were compared to cockroaches and rats they are keen on wiping them out of this environment
4470347 they just want a blanket injunction against the capture of monk parakeets notwithstanding the fact that the legislature has made it that the monk parakeets can be caught and can be killed when they constitute a threat to public health and public safety
4470348 theres no other reasonable way to solve the problem the problem of course is flammable nests on the high voltage electrical equipment
4470349 some earnest and well meaning people talking about things they built in their back yard about dreams that they have about hopes that they have about other ways to solve the problem
4470350 taking down the nests is a reasonable and prudent alternative if you dont kill the birds
4470351 theyre colorful charismatic and a great many people take delight in their antics
4470352 theyre seeking an injunction they have to show there is no threat to public health and public safety
4470353 one could easily argue that one would like a lot of these things hopping around your backyard
4470354 all i can say is theyre an extremely likable species
4470355 people enjoy watching them they enjoy seeing tropical species in action
4470356 whatever the usda did after they were turned over i dont know and cant stipulate
4470357 they mad as hell and theyre not going to be content until they eliminate those birds from connecticuts environment
4470358 the question is whether were going to let them get away with it
4470359 animals also have rights animals also do not want to suffer they want to be treated humanely they want to receive love and affection and they certainly want to live out their natural lives they do not want to die or be killed before their natural end this is also their right
4470360 well if i was listening correctly i think its john mayer and jennifer aniston

4470396 i am above all astounded by the mainstream medias failure to take proper note of the pipleline geopolitics that infuses the russian moves with their global significance
4470397 at the same time it pales in significance if compared to analogous u s behavior especially the 2003 unprovoked and unlawful aggression against iraq at this point what is needed in georgia is for the russians to withdraw and for the un to establish a peacekeeping presence in south ossetia and abkhasia capable of protecting the human rights and autonomy of these two societal entities until some sort of internationally monitored referendum can serve as the basis for self determination in both places to revive cold war rhetoric of the free world in relation to georgia as bush did in his statement on the crisis is one more instance of monumental irresponsibility by the president and orwellian in its implication that georgia was a democracy respectful of human rights

4470400 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale realtytrac now has more than three quarters of a million properties in its active reo database a number that represents approximately 17 percent of the inventory of existing homes for sale reported in june by the national association of realtors
4470401 now the discussion within the framework of the eu project damocles an ice monitoring system is will the arctic be ice free in summer in 20 or 40 years
4470402 an important caveat is that the arctic sea ice in the arctic is highly variable
4470403 its quite possible we could have a very warm year that yields ice free conditions one summer but then some cooler conditions in following years that keep ice around through the summer
4470404 so once summer ice is gone in one year doesnt mean its gone for good
4470405 first there is no doubt that the central arctic will remain ice covered except during a few summer months so the specific difficulties imposed by the sea ice will remain over most months of the year
4470406 second the arctic sea ice is continuously drifting a station on the sea ice will be moving relatively to the sea floor as a consequence all activities which require instrumentation at a fixed position like drilling would have to be performed completely underwater with no direct contact to the atmosphere or as an alternative from a ship which actively melts away all the sea ice approaching its position this would require huge amounts of energy
4470407 sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources
4470408 indeed in the arctic as in the rest of the world the delimitation of the outer continental shelf is an orderly process subject to rules enshrined in unclos and to date it has been carried out in a fairly disciplined manner

4470446 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4470447 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4470448 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4470449 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4470450 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4470451 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4470452 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4470453 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4470454 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4470455 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4470456 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4470457 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4470458 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4470459 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4470460 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4470461 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4470462 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4470463 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4470464 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4470465 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4470466 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4470467 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4470468 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4470469 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4470470 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4470471 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4470472 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4470473 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4470474 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4470475 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4470476 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4470477 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4470478 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4470479 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4470480 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4470481 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4470482 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4470483 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4470484 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4470485 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4470486 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4470487 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4470488 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4470489 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4470490 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4470491 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4470492 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4470493 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented
4470494 we have one general commander for the black sea fleet it is the president of russia and all commands from outside are illegitimate to us for this reason the procedure and any permission for manoeuvres of the black sea fleet are set down in existing documents
4470495 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4470496 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4470497 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4470498 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4470499 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4470500 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4470501 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4470502 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4470503 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4470504 were kind of at a standstill because of not having funding
4470505 one of our goals is to show how goodridge who was born a slave overcame tremendous obstacles and became one of the wealthiest men in york at the time
4470506 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4470507 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4470512 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place
4470513 he should be in myrtle beach if hes going to take a vacation at this time

4470563 wed talked about this with sam but then he passed away so i thought lets get the guys together and do it
4470564 weve been with old friends and friends from uni have joined us on the way
4470565 the north coast from minehead was all up and down so quite tough but weve enjoyed every part
4470566 my feet are not in a very good state but its all been fantastic the walk is stunning
4470567 so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaslessly into the past
4470568 chaddy looked to be one of the strongest guys in the front group and that bodes well for the rest of the week
4470569 it was a pretty tough course but saturday will be even harder
4470570 i dont usually give these out to people but you really seem to care
4470571 this is tragic not only for us the family but for people in general
4470572 right now a lot of us are still post traumatized by this
4470573 what can you say theres nothing we can say theres nothing we can do other than believe the systems going to run its course
4470574 i think that the accused have to know that there are people here who care again representing jennifer
4470575 jennifer was a very loved person we still love her we love the memories of her and its going to grow and grow
4470576 actually i am in the process of doing that right now your honour
4470577 obviously i could do with a few more weeks training
4470578 but i am here and i think the fact that im here and im strong very strong actually will be an advantage for me in the race too
4470579 its just about going in and running the best race i can do control yourself and hopefully cope well with the conditions which are going to make it a very tough race
4470580 i looked up and saw the brick wall coming at us
4470581 i immediately turned and capt pittman was right with me so as we both turned and took a couple of steps we saw our other two guys with the hose and grabbed them
4470582 we just ended up crashing into the ditch it was just like a giant game of twister
4470583 thank god he had his air mask on so he could breathe
4470584 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4470585 it wasnt hard to extract that theme out of the story of helen thomas
4470586 and the changing of the guard was an important topic to address in the film though thomas is an extraordinary journalist who has been on the front lines watching these presidents over the last nine administrations i hope the film culminates with something even more important than her personal story with the question of the role of journalism today its not clear that there will be a successor to thomas who has asked the difficult questions over the years
4470587 can you and will you provide proof that you did indeed say it would be wrong
4470588 would we consider dealing directly with the viet cong in negotiating an end to the war in vietnam
4470589 there have been reports that you were told directly or indirectly at least twice that the contras were benefitting from the iran arms sales is that true
4470590 why do you refuse to respect the wall between church and state
4470591 it requires individual journalists who are willing to take the risks required
4470592 and also the institutions to support that kind of journalism unfortunately i think were lacking on both fronts
4470593 one of the things thomas talks about is how hard it is for a president after he has lost the trust of the press and the public
4470594 its like a relationship like any wed have with another person
4470595 you cant get away with not answering questions as a president without damaging your relationship to the public thats one of many ways to explain why bushs approval ratings have plummeted its obviously because of the war and his disconnection to the pain of people and so on a whole range of issues but i also think it relates to his unwillingness to answer the questions of people and the press we need accessibility as a country right now
4470596 helen would argue that we could have avoided this war in iraq if the press had really held the administration to account more than they did
4470597 as a democracy we rely on the press to ask the questions and get the answers for us otherwise were not informed and its a problem
4470598 when we were working on the film and i was walking around washington with helen she was like a rock star
4470599 and there arent that many rock stars in d c as you can imagine at restaurants or on the street people would come up to her and say youre my hero helen even a guy who said he was a republican and worked for homeland security said she was his hero the reason is her relentless willingness to ask questions and unfortunately even the journalists who count her as a hero dont have that same quality

4470606 you have to have the necessary information about the peoples background that you feel safe
4470607 if you have a history of larceny or embezzlement and you try to work for a bank they should be able to know
4470608 im very much for trying to find ways to reform cori and still keep people safe
4470609 people shouldnt be branded for life if they commit a certain type of offense on one hand we need people to know but on the other hand we cant take away a persons right to have a life
4470610 the cases come to us and we can prosecute them but what will keep them from coming back is treatment
4470611 theres not nearly enough programs available a lot of these cases would not make it to court if we had enough resources on the front end to treat the behaviors that lead them to us
4470612 personally im open to it and i know the people in public safety are for it

4470865 extent of mccains involvement in the military conflict in georgia appears remarkable among presidential candidates who traditionally have kept some distance from unfolding crises out of deference to whoever is occupying the white house the episode also follows months of sustained gop criticism of democratic sen barack obama who was accused of acting too presidential for among other things briefly adopting a campaign seal and taking a trip abroad that included a huge rally in berlin
4470866 sarkozy who negotiated tuesdays fragile peace deal and john mccain republican presidential candidate whose pro georgian rhetoric has grown stronger by the day
4470867 calling georgian president mikheil saakashvili mischa mccain said that russian prime minister vladimir putin is bent on reasserting russian influence in the region and perhaps the world
4470868 the crisis in the former soviet republic of georgia seems made to order for mccain
4470869 were told over breakfast yesterday what really happened in georgia the conflict in south ossetia was part of a plot by dick cheney the vice president to stop barak obama being elected president of the united states
4470870 will be placed in the nomination at the democratic convention in denver at the end of this month the joint announcement came from the obama and clinton camps it said this move will ensure the voices of all 35 million people who took part in the us primary process are heard it wont change the outcome however to underscore that
4470871 said today she will cast her own delegate vote for barack obama
4470872 sounds fine now there have been persistent concerns a roll call of the states with delegations methodically announcing tallies has the potential of turning divisive emotions attached to each candidate still raw
4470873 the decision was brokered after long negotiations by advisers to both senators with mr obama ultimately signing off on the plan on wednesday
4470874 said we havent worked out the mechanics of when the roll call vote of the states will be held
4470875 suggested some clinton delegates could switch to obama in the roll call
4470876 all that high profile clinton action spread over at least half of the conventions four prime time speaking nights ensures an enormous presence for the couple who have been national fixtures in the democratic party since 1992 and whose latest white house bid hers split the party into for them or against them camps
4470877 many of clintons backers remain wary of the presumptive nominee when the two appeared in unity nh in late june to show that they were together the crowd cheered clinton but was lukewarm toward obama
4470878 according to a pew research center poll released on wednesday former supporters of sen clinton continue to elude sen obama of her backers 72 now support the illinois senator by comparison 88 of supporters of sen mccains former rivals now support him
4470879 comments wednesday to the weekly standards stephen hayes that former pennsylvania gov tom ridges pro abortion rights views wouldnt necessarily rule him out quickly found their way into the in boxes of christian conservatives
4470880 some in the gop who supported other candidates in the primary and are having trouble mustering much enthusiasm for mccain the mere mention of a pro choice running mate is disheartening
4470881 i think hes one of the most outstanding brilliant and broadly experienced people i wish he were pro life i wish everybody was its sen mccains choice to make i hope that whoever he picks would be pro life
4470882 for the second consecutive day mike huckabee made public statements suggesting john mccain ought not pick mitt romney as his running mate i think there are better choices for sen mccain that have the approval of value voters huckabee said on fox news
4470883 he told cbs that many republicans are not necessarily comfortable with romney because of his changed positions
4470884 make back to back appearances saturday at an evangelical conference aimed at getting the presidential hopefuls views on issues dealing with leadership and compassion
4470885 of the forum at the 22 000 member saddleback church in orange county calif is a conversation not a confrontation said larry ross a spokesman for rick warren the megachurchs pastor
4470886 standing on one of the many generational breaks surfacing in this election cycle
4470887 found that while a majority of young white evangelicals describe themselves as conservative on social issues slightly more identified this year as either independents or democrats than as republicans
4470888 kind of young evangelical voter whom democratic sen barack obama has targeted and republican sen john mccain cannot afford to lose
4470889 say republicans have failed to deliver on the abortion issue and they are weighing their electoral options this year sen john mccain could be dealt a major blow if the liberal evangelical movement expands and persuades voters to embrace mr obama or sit out the election
4470890 who is pro choice is trying to give such voters a home
4470891 a top strategist for sen john mccains campaign said thursday that the presidential contest in virginia will undoubtedly be close this fall and acknowledged that the state should no longer be considered a republican stronghold
4470892 the comments by mike duhaime mccains political director represent a significant shift in the gops thinking and are the latest signal that virginia is emerging as a state that could make or break mccains chances to defeat illinois sen barack obama the presumptive democratic nominee
4470893 for months john mccains presidential campaign was a near constant swirl of free ranging chats with voters garrulous sessions with reporters and quips from the candidate that often had little to do with the days planned message no more
4470894 mccains campaign has notably limited his exposure to national reporters and even voters devoting more time to private fundraisers interviews with local journalists and events designed for tv cameras
4470895 john mccain on thursday got some welcome ammunition in his defense against democratic charges that he violated campaign finance law but hes not out of the woods yet
4470896 released a draft opinion asserting that mccain the presumptive republican candidate did not violate the provisions of the primary election public funding system
4470897 hit back thursday with a 40 page rebuttal to the best selling book the obama nation arguing the author is a fringe bigot peddling rehashed lies
4470898 anti obama book the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality claims the illinois senator is a dangerous radical candidate for president
4470899 picked apart the books claims in a rebuttal titled unfit for publication to be posted on the obama campaigns rumor fighting web site fightthesmears com
4470900 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4470901 unfortunately but unsurprisingly given his earlier hit job on the last democratic nominee mr corsis latest is rife with inaccuracies and innuendo
4470902 seeks to smear obama as a leftist and add fuel to the false and discredited rumor that he is secretly a radical muslim or at least has extensive connections to islam
4470903 the point isnt to tell the truth the point is to repeat the lie and thus give it new life
4470904 the planes owner midwest airlines said there was never an issue of safety and an faa official said the pilot never declared an emergency these tapes obtained by abc news prove otherwise just after takeoff from chicago the pilot of the midwest charter flight told the st louis tower he had lost full control of the md 81 jets up and down movement

4470906 presidential campaign last december on the eve of the iowa caucuses two lawyers surfaced with written statements that appeared to exonerate the candidate
4470907 said that his client rielle hunter a pregnant 43 year old filmmaker was not carrying mr edwardss child shortly thereafter the other lawyer pamela j marple of washington sent word that her client andrew young an edwards campaign aide was the babys father
4470908 to deflate the anonymously sourced reports of an edwards tryst
4470909 are linked through fred baron a wealthy dallas lawyer and former finance chairman for the edwards campaign who was a key player in the campaigns response to the scandal
4470910 that he thought tabloid reports that edwards had an affair with campaign videographer rielle hunter were untrue when he paid to relocate her and another campaign worker and his family to california last year
4470911 i will restate what i have previously stated on one point i learned of the affair only a few weeks ago and had previously presumed that the tabloid stuff was all bogus
4470912 the widening gap between the united states and russia expanded further
4470913 described thursday by us and polish officials includes washingtons commitment to deploy patriot missile batteries in poland it also goes beyond the north atlantic treaty organizations mutual commitment provisions to protect warsaw from outside aggression

4470915 russias invasion of georgia pushed the poles to be very frank
4470916 sends a signal to moscow that people are not going to be intimidated
4470917 the strongest reaction so far to russias military operation in georgia
4470918 reacted angrily saying that the move would worsen relations with the united states that have already been strained severely in the week since russian troops entered separatist enclaves in georgia a close american ally
4470919 russias invasion of georgia seems to have concentrated the minds of at least some politicians in europe
4470920 ten missile interceptors are no deterrent to the russian nuclear stockpile and the missile shield is really intended to blunt an attack from iran or a rogue regime
4470921 understand that greater military integration with nato and especially the us is polands only real insurance against a bear attack taking out that policy now when georgia is still getting mauled is no coincidence
4470922 with no sign the russians are ready to back down on georgia
4470923 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4470924 repeated his call for the cease fire to be honored and demanded that russia respect the territorial integrity of georgia

4470927 stressed us solidarity with georgia in conversations with lithuanian president valdas adamkus and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko who have denounced moscows actions
4470928 appeared willing to let russia take its time removing its forces from disputed areas inside the former soviet republic
4470929 reported a sharp drop in russian military activities and said troops seemed to be positioning themselves to depart georgia proper
4470930 us officials acknowledged late in the day that they were uncertain whether any significant russian movement was underway
4470931 russias military offensive into georgia has jolted the bush administrations relationship with moscow senior officials said thursday forcing a wholesale reassessment of american dealings with russia and jeopardizing talks on everything from halting irans nuclear ambitions to reducing strategic arsenals to cooperation on missiles defenses
4470932 with the separatist leaders of the two regions beside him
4470933 advised reporters to forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4470934 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4470935 a blunt message to georgia and the world that appeared to challenge bushs demand a day earlier that russia must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
4470936 two planes of us humanitarian aid have arrived but as long as russian forces stay in georgia delivering that aid is a challenge
4470937 one day after american officials raised the image of a dramatic intervention by air and sea us plans for distributing humanitarian aid to georgia appeared to slow
4470938 there were no detailed plans for the delivery of aid using naval forces
4470939 promised that us naval forces would deliver humanitarian aid to war torn georgia before his administration had received approval from turkey which controls naval access to the black sea or the pentagon had planned a seaborne operation
4470940 that they were increasingly dubious that any us navy vessels would join the aid operation in large part because the us based hospital ships likely to go the usns comfort and the usns mercy would take weeks to arrive
4470941 the president was writing checks to the georgians without knowing what he had in the bank
4470942 a close us ally is likely to resign soon following secret talks aimed at easing his departure people familiar with the situation say

4470945 the details of how mr musharraf would exit and whether he would be able to stay in pakistan or would seek residency abroad are now under discussion between representatives of mr musharraf and the governing coalition
4470946 among the places that mr musharraf is said to favor if he goes abroad are dubai turkey the united kingdom or the united states though his strong preference is to stay in pakistan
4470947 sources say that colin powell is planning to endorse barack obama
4470948 bad news for john mccain but at his age he should expect some colon problems
4470949 cindy mccain went to the hospital because she sprained her wrist and her doctors are saying its nothing serious the sprain is probably just from cutting johns meat into little tiny pieces
4470950 a phrase in the three sentence draft statement that would have required both sides to renounce the use of force

4470988 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato

4471036 despu s de la primera ronda el nivel sube mucho y es muy dif cil clasificarse para semifinales
4471037 los errores se pagan si hubiera hecho una mejor salida y un mejor final pod a haber rebajado el tiempo que hice por la ma ana pero no me salieron las cosas
4471038 pese a todo ha sido una experiencia grande para mi carrera deportiva soy muy joven y esto me servir de experiencia para preparar desde ya los pr ximos juegos
4471039 intentar concentrarme en la salida y procurar hacer una buena curva para llegar lo m s lejos posible
4471040 reconozco que es doloroso perder de esa forma con tres puntos de partido en la mano y desperdiciarlo en esa acci n yo no not nada est bamos cansados y no sent que la bola tocara mi raqueta casi ni me acuerdo no creo que tenga tanta importancia
4471041 le ped perd n y no lo acept es su problema fue un solo punto dentro de un partido entero no creo que sea tan importante
4471042 haber alcanzado por primera vez una final individual en unos juegos en atenas la derrota de semifinales fue el peor d a de mi carrera pero al d a siguiente cuando gan el bronce fue el mejor
4471043 vi el partido perdido estaba cansado y eran unos momentos clave estaba a un s lo punto de perder pero jugu muy bien en ese momento y salv la situaci n eso me dio energ a
4471044 por eso si pierdo tendr una de cada metal el oro del dobles y el bronce individual de atenas 2004 pero si gano tendr dos oros

4471048 es una pista r pida y la carrera ha sido muy lanzada desde el principio me hubiera gustado una carrera m s t ctica y haberme podido reservar un poco para los ltimos metros pero hoy las piernas no me funcionaron como yo hubiera querido
4471049 estoy muy decepcionado tuve una gran oportunidad con el 0 40 que eran tres bolas de partido pero dej una derecha a mitad de pista y despu s err otra ocasi n no las aprovech no supe jugar bien los puntos importantes
4471050 comenzamos temprano en el agua con un vientito del norte luego se calm y tuvimos que salir despu s a la cinco de la tarde con un viento que no termin de establecerse en uno de los roles me agarr en el lado malo e hice una aproximaci n a la boya muy mala y termin el vig simo octavo
4471051 ha sido mal resultado continu pero todos est con una regata mala este ha sido mi peor resultado pero con seis pruebas llega el descarte por lo que todo se emparejar en la parte de arriba

4471061 el partido contra cuba fue interesante y lo nico que no me gust fue el final

4471108 we have known sophie since primary school and really just wanted to do something for her se has done so much for charity herself already that we decided it was our turn after all its down to her we have our keyboard player julia who sophie met at university and introduced us to
4471109 im hoping there could be a lot of exciting things in the not so distant future since glastonbury watch this space
4471110 im just finishing off a summer tour with jools holland and then im packing my bags for colne

4471117 der georgische spitzenpolitiker geh rt zu denen die mit ihren l gen die anderen verr ckt machen
4471118 wahrscheinlich hat der franz sische pr sident diese eigenschaft des georgischen pr sidenten erkannt und nicht gemeinsam mit den spitzenpolitikern des baltikums polens und der ukraine an der kundgebung in tiflis teilgenommen

4471123 ich meine in erster linie die humanit re katastrophe die von den georgischen bombardierungen und besch ssen verursacht wurde
4471124 wenn ein land der raketenstationierung zustimmt bernimmt es nat rlich bestimmte verpflichtungen
4471125 jede milit ranlage erregt aufsehen auf der anderen seite daher muss man nat rlich vorsichtiger sein denn die andere seite zieht dann eventuell die vernichtung dieser anlage im kriegsfall in betracht
4471126 in bezug auf diese ernsthafte frage spitzt die us seite ihre beziehungen mit russland zu
4471127 deshalb soll moskau engere beziehungen zur europ ischen union eu herstellen und gemeinsam gegen die entfachung von konflikten auf dem kontinent ank mpfen
4471128 wir sind uns dar ber im klaren dass das regime saakaschwilis in georgien genau so wie das ukrainische und einige andere regime direkt von den amerikanern aufgep ppelt wurden das sind deren politische projekte
4471129 dabei gehe ich von der logik der politischen gesetze aus die genauso wie die physikalischen immer anwendbar sind in dieser hinsicht ist vor allem in der ukraine die situation f r einen schlag gegen russland herangereift was pr sident viktor juschtschenko dabei zum anlass nimmt ist eher eine taktische frage die ich im moment nicht beantworten kann
4471130 wir russland und eu m ssen jetzt verstehen dass die sicherheit in europa in unserem gemeinsamen interesse liegt w hrend des kalten krieges half amerika das problem des kommunismus zu l sen aber jetzt artet amerika selbst zu einem problem aus sie wollen den frieden auf unserem kontinent ruinieren

4471144 their attacks on schools teachers and others working on education are systematic not random
4471145 they are part of a deliberate attack on human rights on equality for women and on any attempt by their to control their own destiny
4471146 there must be an end to impunity for those who attack schools students and educators
4471147 intensify efforts to put an end to the growing pattern of attacks

4471158 community intelligence supported by the examination of computer equipment and mobile call data has shown that both of the victims have been involved in fraudulent activity which has angered and upset a number of people
4471159 yes that is the essence of being human any person you meet at a party will be interested in his own life above all other topics your awkward silences can be solved by asking simple questions about the persons life
4471160 first of all it would be like interrogating him secondly i couldnt possibly pretend to be interested in the answers if he turns out to be some shoe salesman living with his mother in albany my eyes will glaze over
4471161 it would seem phony to you while you asked the questions but it would not seem that way to the stranger to him it is an unexpected gift an opportunity to enjoy one of lifes greatest pleasures talking about oneself he would become more animated and he would instantly begin to like you you would seem to be a brilliant and talented conversationalist even if your only contribution was asking questions and listening and you would have solved the strangers fear of an awkward silence for that he will be grateful
4471162 that solves the strangers problem but i have to listen to this guy drone on about himself the cure is worse than the disease
4471163 your questions to the stranger are only the starting points from there you can steer him toward the thing you care about most yourself
4471164 wouldnt he want to talk about himself instead of me
4471165 when you find out how others deal with their situations it is automatically relevant to you
4471166 there will always be parallels in your life find out what you and he have in common then ask how he likes it how he deals with it and if he has any clever solutions for it perhaps you both have long commutes or you both have mothers who call too often or you both ski
4471167 sure unless i have something to say i dont know how people can blab about nothing
4471168 your problem is that you view conversation as a way to exchange information
4471169 it has been a long and hard road for me and my fellow athletes through the years of the taliban and the war but now it is easier
4471170 however i am confident that once there is a track there is enough natural talent in the country for us to start winning medals at championship level
4471171 it was really difficult under the taliban regime they would not let you train every day i got fed up and knew i had to move somewhere to make a real go of making it in athletics pakistan and trained there
4471172 for the olympics he offered 60 000 dollars for a medal 50 000 for making the final and 5 000 dollars for going out in the first round
4471173 this of course is on condition that we return home
4471174 it is a dream for me to be competing at this competition alongside sprinters of the quality of usain bolt present world recordholder and tyson gay 2007 world champion
4471175 to be with them in the warm up area and to see them run is unbelievable for me
4471176 considering the tournament takes place on the sub continent the selection committee has opted for two spinners

4471184 the postponement of echelon resorts is likely to put more strain on the las vegas housing market the housing industry was counting on the creation of thousands of jobs with the opening of new resorts to help lift the market out of its doldrums of the past two years
4471185 rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam used to fast till we would say that he would never stop fasting and he would abandon fasting till we would say that he would never fast i never saw rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam fasting for a whole month except the month of ramadh n and did not see him fasting in any month more than in the month of shab n
4471186 rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam used to fast the whole month of shab n except for a few days
4471187 o rasoolullah i do not see you fasting in any month as much as in shab n
4471188 it is a month people are negligent of between rajab and ramadh n it is a month in which deeds are raised towards the lord of the worlds therefore i like my deeds to be raised whilst i am fasting
4471189 when it is the fifteenth of shab n then stand in worship at night and fast during the day because allah subhanahu wataaala descends in this night at sunset to the first heaven and says is there any seeker of forgiveness that i may forgive him is there any seeker of sustenance that i may sustain him is there anyone in affliction that i may remove his affliction is there anyone like this like that and so on this continues until fajr
4471190 in the fifteenth night of shab n allah subhanahu wataaala manifests and forgives all his creation except for the mushrik idolater and the spiteful
4471191 the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam came to me one night and took off his clothes but he had hardly sat down when he got up again put on his clothes and left
4471192 although the chain of narrators of some of these traditions suffers with some minor technical defects yet when all these traditions are combined together it becomes clear that this night has some well founded merits and observing this night as a sacred night is not a baseless concoction as envisaged by some modern scholars who on the basis of these minor defects have totally rejected to give any special importance to this night in fact some of these traditions have been held by some scholars of hadeeth as authentic and the defects in the chain of some others have been treated by them as minor technical defects which according to the science of hadeeth are curable by the variety of their ways of narration that is why the elders of the ummah have constantly been observing this night as a night of special merits and have been spending it in worship and prayers
4471193 o allah make my love for you the most beloved thing to me and my fear for you the most fearful thing to me and remove from me all worldly needs and wants by instilling a passion for meeting you and when you have given the people of the world the pleasures of their world make the coolness of my eyes pleasure in worshipping you

4471236 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4471237 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4471238 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4471239 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4471277 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
4471278 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
4471279 in this difficult consumer environment we have continued to focus on tightly controlling all aspects of our business and our second quarter results show the benefits of our approach
4471280 our ability to protect our bottom line through rigorous expense control and effective inventory management was enhanced by good initial customer response to our new brand launches and the effectiveness of our promotional pricing actions
4471281 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living

4471289 athletes are continually in a dialogue or negotiation with themselves assessing how fatigued they feel
4471290 adept runners are faster due to their underlying physiological capacity rather than because they put more relative effort into their competition
4471291 when you prepare and go out and run a 10 k the person who wins is probably not running harder
4471292 to me what they are saying is there is a protective system built in that doesnt allow us to overuse our muscles
4471293 when you do something repetitive the body knows how to prevent injury
4471294 is a learned pattern of behavior and the muscles get regulated subconsciously by the brain
4471295 it gives us hope we arent going to kill ourselves
4471296 today we are finally switching to the java net svn repository for all development which means changes to lwuit will be made live within that repository
4471297 to further accelerate the adoption of the lwuit framework it is important to provide access to the source code under a liberal and well known open source license so today sun is announcing the release and immediate availability of the complete source code of the lwuit framework under the gplv2 license with the classpath exception this license choice provides the benefits of open source innovation and collaborative development while offering a risk free path to adoption by commercial products a model everybody should feel very comfortable with
4471298 you may have heard that javase 6 update 10 is supposed to improve the experience of applets you may have even seen the demos of dragging and dropping applets out of the webbrowser but theres a lot more to it than that in this series of blogs ill show you how to get the most out of deploying your applets even if you arent using update 10

4471302 from the nature of your questions im having the impression that youre new around communication networks going on that assumption allow me to go through some of the basics before you build your server you must consider the nature of your connections is it imperative that the data come across correctly and completely or is it acceptable that data is lost along the way an example of a need for integrity is when viewing documents an example of an application that may accept some loss is a video conference reliable transfer uses tcp unreliable uses udp in java nio tcp is modelled through server socketchannel while udp is modelled through datagramchannel
4471303 i am well aware that this method can be a few hundred times slower windows mobile 5 provides the alphablend method call but it appears that not all devices support it i have read some reports on forums that the imaging api is rather slow too but it is probably faster than the java implementation if the alphablend method does not work i can only hope that providing a native blending implementation helps
4471304 if you call yourself a real texan see if you can place this quotation

4471317 the doctor strongly suggested that if i wanted to heal properly i needed to quit
4471318 when you start talking about your face it becomes motivating
4471319 when someone hears this from an internist or cardiologist who says its really bad for you it increases your risk of lung cancer its bad for your heart people tend to blow that off if theyre feeling well
4471320 but if they have a medical problem and are not going for just a routine checkup they may tend to listen to that advice more
4471321 with plastic surgery its a little bit different people are desirous of an elective procedure and thats their main objective in coming in its something they truly want
4471322 nicotine causes the tiny blood vessels in the skin to clamp down or constrict which reduces blood supply to the skin
4471323 twenty five years ago it may have been more acceptable for a patient to have undergone surgical procedures while smoking
4471324 nowadays if a doctor knew a patient was smoking and they did flap surgery
4471325 why invest so much money in a cosmetic procedure for enhancement if the patient will not participate and do his or her part to help ensure the best outcome possible
4471326 you can talk to people about quitting smoking but you may not have a months worth of time before you try to save their life with heart surgery
4471327 with the advent of things like chantix we have a much higher success rate
4471328 i want it to look great for you as well as for myself if they smoke even one cigarette i run the risk of it not healing its like trying to water your lawn with a crimped hose
4471329 this is not a prime driver of quitting in america
4471330 these are all adults and im not going to be the person looking over their shoulders
4471331 this was like the first major surgery id had as an adult
4471332 so when my doctor who i respect tells me not to smoke and here are some reasons why then i have to respect that
4471333 they see the wound opening up turning red or black the edges start coming apart
4471334 they see the skin graft we use to put it back together
4471335 i was afraid the anesthesia would go wrong or id wake up coughing my head off and split my guts open

4471340 i would like to take this opportunity to apologise to him his friends and family for any distortion of public opinion or distress that my comments may have had and i hope this letter serves to go some way to correct that
4471341 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
4471342 our business model is starting to deliver profits each year
4471343 although we have seen in the last two years the difference that participation in european competition makes
4471344 in the current football player market it is increasingly clear that our ability to compete on transfer fees and wages with clubs from the five main footballing nations and particularly in england is limited
4471345 in consequence we look to gain advantage through improved scouting player development and coaching and the use of sports science and performance analysis

4471361 we really did shout because you suddenly passed out and we tried to wake you up
4471362 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4471363 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4471364 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah
4471365 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4471366 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4471367 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4471368 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted
4471369 are you going to suggest that i sniff smelling salts
4471370 its not the marijuana thats dangerous for me its the chocolate to which i could easily become addicted again
4471371 the 24 hour period that starts when we say it does
4471372 if you just look at the scrabble application wall its pretty clear that there are a few people who are angry enough at hasbro and ea to want to sabotage the game
4471373 he is still on leave and we never issued a statement that his services would be terminated his services are still needed by the hospital

4471420 obviously i could do with a few more weeks training
4471421 but i am here and i think the fact that im here and im strong very strong actually will be an advantage for me in the race too
4471422 its just about going in and running the best race i can do control yourself and hopefully cope well with the conditions which are going to make it a very tough race
4471423 i cant believe the unbearable conditions palestinians are forced to live under in the west bank
4471424 122 killed in the streets suspected collaborators 41 by capital punishment 34 honor killings 48 stabbed to death seven beaten to death 258 killed under mysterious circumstances and 818 cases of gunfire so far no one has been charged let alone tried for any of these unlawful killings
4471425 the appalling fact only fitfully reported in north america is that the two major palestinian factions are committed to an often murderous conflict
4471426 analysts say a desire to prevent the west bank from falling to islamists appears to override other western concerns
4471427 we want a complete israeli withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 including jerusalem and agreement on all the final status questions
4471428 i will not agree to any israeli sovereign presence in jerusalem neither in the armenian quarter nor in the al aqsa mosque neither in via dolorosa nor in the church of the holy sepulcher they can occupy us by force because we are weaker now but in two years ten years or one hundred years there will be someone who will liberate jerusalem
4471429 who warned jews to repent to prevent the fall of jerusalem which he prophesied his advice not only was ignored but he also was imprisoned for stating views that threatened the kings power
4471430 there are people who are already concerned with the next destruction
4471431 i think people have me mixed up with my character
4471432 i would like to be as sure and magnanimous and feisty and strong and indomitable as she is
4471433 i think friday will be a big thing to see how sore how stiff the arm is ill drive back home tonight wait a day kind of do some self rehab myself tomorrow then i fly out saturday morning and go out to pittsburgh ive got pitch a simulated game saturday probably around noon and ill go from there if i bounce back from today and am able to pitch out there ill probably be activated on monday and go from there
4471434 this time of the year every win is huge regardless of who its against teams that are not quite in the race are looking to knock you off so theres incentive on both sides it doesnt matter who you beat this time of year youve just got to put ws in the column
4471435 thats been our weakness we havent been able to play well against the teams below 500 every time we come to play the washington nationals they always find a way to play good baseball against us but this time we tried to approached them the same way we approach the phillies the same way we approach the teams that are in contention

4471454 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
4471455 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
4471456 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
4471457 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
4471458 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
4471459 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
4471460 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol

4471465 the ocean community is on the threshold of a new era in which an ensemble of novel technologies will provide us with an increasingly powerful capacity for exploring and interacting with the global ocean system
4471466 the cruise itself is an example of the coming generation of systems where highly capable autonomous underwater vehicles like sentry will be integral components todays auvs are helping us develop the power and high speed communications network well need to explore powerful and potentially dangerous processes at underwater volcanoes within powerful tsunamis or in the wake of large storms and hurricanes
4471467 seeing the first maps pop up on our screen was a real thrill for us they represent the results of hard work by all members of our team
4471468 most developed nations have major research efforts focused on understanding and learning to use these energy rich deposits of methane
4471469 our plan is to build the infrastructure that will allow entire generations of scientists to study these deposits firsthand using robotic telepresence no other country is there yet
4471470 the key to choosing these locations is to find sites that are protected but within reach of really interesting processes that were trying to investigate

4471474 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
4471475 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
4471476 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
4471477 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
4471478 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us

4471680 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4471681 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4471682 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4471683 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4471684 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4471685 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4471686 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4471687 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
4471688 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
4471689 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

4471704 im a man playing a man dressed as another man
4471705 hes a young man that plays extremely hard and plays with a great deal of physicality
4471706 hes no holds barred in terms of his aggressiveness runs the floor well and can defend multiple positions
4471707 ive been told they want to go in that direction and add a little bit of depth in that area
4471708 offense is very important but these guys need to make a commitment on the defensive end and take a lot of pride in not allowing guys to score on us
4471709 we just felt like there was too big of a drop off over the last couple of years when steve nash went out of the game and that we couldnt always survive on just making jump shots
4471710 you have to be able mix it up get offensive rebounds and make dirt worker plays as cotton fitzsimmons used to say you have to be able to draw charges and create extra possessions
4471711 he goes along those lines of that defensive tenacity theme that were putting together this summer
4471712 hes a good shotblocker has an exceedingly high amount of energy and plays with that sort of abandon that we needed to bring to our team
4471713 hes really versatile for a big man in that he can grab the ball off the board and lead a fast break hes similar to boris in that he is a big man that can pass well
4471714 but hes different from most bigs in that he can put it on the floor and make a play hes a guy who will face up and create something for others and not worry about scoring himself
4471715 we paid close attention to him at the summer league in las vegas with the golden state warriors
4471716 hes very active the kind of guy you like to have coming off the bench to change the tempo of the game
4471717 if we can develop him then we have yet another good young asset
4471718 playing with steve nash shaq and amar stoudemire you cant ask for more than that
4471719 those guys are great players hall of famers i cant wait to get down here and get things started

4471791 the disease targets are not ones cytos is developing in its own program
4471792 we are definitely delighted to have such a top tier pharma company on board
4471793 as an excellent technology for the development of therapeutic vaccines
4471794 we are free to use our technology for our own programs it doesnt block us
4471795 the pfizer deal also bodes well for the planned out licensing of other well progressed lead projects
4471796 the vaccine candidates for both indications have clearly blockbuster potential
4471797 not only licensing schemes requiring speech to be submitted to an administrative censor for prepublication review but also injunctions against future speech issued by judges
4471798 the injunction is allowing us to review the research that they have and see if there is any validity to their findings and take corrective action if any is even necessary
4471799 itll be a factor in the overall analysis but it isnt the only factor
4471800 it is another element although unexpected of the overall analysis of the situation and will be factored into his recommendation
4471801 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people

4471807 going to the manoir with raymond blanc spurred me on but it spurred me on to go in a different direction
4471808 maybe if id gone to a smaller kitchen and i was a bigger cog in a smaller wheel i wouldnt have felt the need to go down my own path and maybe i wouldnt have ended up this way
4471809 no i knew i wanted to have a restaurant but that was it when i opened i thought maybe one day id have a michelin star nine out of 10 in the good food guide is amazing the fat ducks score last year i thought theyd stopped doing tens a few years ago so it was the ambition i never had in terms of ratings this is almost like the last frontier its such a special thing because it came out of the blue
4471810 i was very very excited and slightly disbelieving i found out a couple of weeks ago but i couldnt tell anyone until last night it was a kiddy thing if i told somebody maybe it wouldnt happen
4471811 most of the work we do is in development stuff that might seem really boring you cant get the more theatrical creative fun stuff which is absolutely essential for certain areas of the menu without all the tireless work at base level
4471812 ive got a team of brilliant people both in the kitchen and front of house that work their socks off
4471813 what do we want a restaurant to do feed us well memorably courteously and offer value for money the fat duck does all that and much more its great fun and it all adds up to a dining experience of the most wondrous enchantment
4471814 its extremely rare that a restaurant cooks perfectly on a consistent basis but weve had so many superlative reports that were delighted to recognise the fat duck as the best restaurant in britain
4471815 my first paid job as a chef was opening the fat duck when i look back on it i think naivety is a beautiful thing had i known what was going to come in the ensuing 5 or 6 years i wouldnt have had the guts to do it
4471816 we cant take our foot off the pedal we cant think that the fat ducks got a name and whatever we do is fine we cant ever think that way

4471825 people who were highly anxious had raised wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4471826 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4471827 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4471828 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same person s response on the day when they were not stressed
4471829 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress

4471961 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations but by the same token my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4471962 i accuse the government of russia of deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing and i can prove it with international organizations already bringing testimony to what im saying and weve received 1 400 reports of brutal attacks slaughters rapes and internment of people in violation of rules of geneva conventions and international humanitarian law
4471963 the israeli report on the killing of fadel has grown fears among palestinian journalists covering the conflict with israel in the gaza between the palestinians and the israelis in the gaza strip about the mission you know the mission to cover and to film and we have been hearing from all other colleagues that they are not certain they are not sure about their lives anymore after such a report which makes clear that the mere raising of a camera in the street in a refugee camp or near the border can put someones life in danger
4471964 in this incident on april 16th six civilians were killed by flechette darts a weapon that is illegal that should not be being used in these conditions in the gaza strip and one of the six was a journalist
4471965 the sentence could not be appealed guilty for converting to christianity a young saudi woman was set alight by her father who first had cut her tongue not an ordinary father but a member of the commission for the promotion of virtue and against vice a sort of police watching over the moral behaviour of the citizens of saudi arabia and the full compliance with the rules of the rigid wahabi doctrine by using whiplashes on the legs for too high heels and arresting men and women not linked by marriage or family bonds for meetings in restaurants to the injury of the conversion the woman had added also the insult of the written word by writing articles with christian religious content on blogs and regional websites the brutal news reported by the united arab emirates uae s daily gulf news reflects the reality of saudi arabia

4471975 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4471976 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4471977 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4471978 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4471979 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well

4471986 its my third season and it seems as if thats always been the mentality its almost better when our backs are against the wall we kind of invite that
4471987 for me the situation with the stadium and chief executive is a non issue really we dont bother about stadiums and chief execs were everton players and we dont like to hear any of the negative things
4471988 thats one side of it and on the other side were not really in a position to do anything about it so we dont bother ourselves
4471989 the guys here have worked so hard pre season as a body of players we feel fit and we feel ready and when a new signing does come in and it will that will be a big boost for everyone
4471990 i think players always want to see player movement unless its in your position of course i think thats natural at any club in terms of the mood i think we all know that the bodies in here have to do a job this weekend
4471991 i dont think we have the luxury as players to overly concern ourselves with the comings and goings if we dont get the result on saturday people arent going to say we can start again we have to be bang on it from the first game
4471992 last year particularly on the european nights you could just feel them pushing us forward and willing us on against fiorentina it was an awesome atmosphere and it must have been frightening for fiorentina
4471993 thats one of the things we have in abundance at this club
4471994 the girls have been working hard and we are confident that we can do well this year especially after all the hard work we have put in this pre season i just cant wait for the first game of the season
4471995 it was a big disappointment to lose to arsenal in the community shield we did well in the first half but arsenal kept the ball better and took their chances i think that is what we need to do this season
4471996 i want to get more games under my belt and get more experience of the premier league
4471997 i want us to challenge for every cup we can and be as close to arsenal as we can
4471998 everton are a very good side as they proved last season by finishing fifth
4471999 but we go into the game looking to get something out of it
4472000 we are training hard and we are looking forward to it
4472001 i want us to go there put in a performance and hopefully come away with something
4472002 it has been a very hectic summer we came in late to the club so a lot has been going on and its nice to just get the season started now
4472003 everton have been a bit like us in terms of not being able to get their targets in so far
4472004 no its not currently strong enough to improve on last season
4472005 these things happen in football its just not quite happened yet but im hopeful something will happen
4472006 there is money to spend though and i am looking to bring some in before the end of the transfer window
4472007 i think if you look around football i think its been difficult for quite a lot of clubs to bring players in so i wouldnt just say its everton that have had that problem
4472008 maybe teams havent challenged for fourth with a squad this small before but thats what happens in football and things like this only make you stronger
4472009 we did brilliantly last year we finished fifth and got to the semi finals of the carling cup could maybe have got a little further in the uefa cup so there are a lot of clubs that will be following the model that we went on over the past few years
4472010 its the thing about this football club that if you come here as a young player there are always opportunities if you are good enough to get into the first team and they are not blocked by lots of players being brought in
4472011 i think that four or five players should be excited about being in the first team they are further ahead than we would like to be but they are there
4472012 these boys are good players and i think that in the future they can become very good players
4472013 we should not try to master the text the bible will become more and more mysterious to real exegetes they will see all the depths and distances they will constantly run up against the mystery before which theology is like trying to drain the ocean with a spoon the true exegete will face the text like an astonished child in a wonderful garden not like an advocate of god who has seen all his files

4472044 when we first heard about the opportunity to develop a game based on the original carrier command we were instantly hooked
4472045 for us carrier command was not only one of the most innovative games we had ever played but it is also one of the very few games that truly influenced our gaming tastes and motivated us in our own home grown game development which later materialized in the form of operation flashpoint with similar open ended gameplay and emphasis on a deeply simulated game world
4472046 having the opportunity to create an actual carrier command game is not only a great honor for us but it also allows us to take the legendary title we all love and do it justice with a truly next gen rendition

4472060 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4472061 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4472062 i found some of russias actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible and so i believe that the six point plan must be realized immediately and the russian troops should withdraw from georgia proper
4472063 the point of departure must be the territorial integrity of georgia

4472071 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you have to do this because you have to do it
4472072 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4472073 hes really practicing well he hasnt put a ball on the ground the entire camp so its obvious he concentrated on that all summer i know he took a ball home with him and i imagined he walked around okolona with his ball all summer because you can definitely see the change
4472074 we expect some rebound on a quarter quarter basis given that the extent of the electricity load shedding in q1 08 was not repeated in q2 08 as is evidenced by the pick up in growth in manufacturing
4472075 however we expect a growth rate of 3 4 percent for 2008 as the cumulative 5 0 percentage point hike in interest rates bites deeply into consumer spending for the year
4472076 these latter two sectors could flirt with recession in q3 08 but some respite may be provided by pre christmas orders although a degree of over stocking may still be in the pipeline
4472077 when you gel the performance of the company and combine with the proven capabilities of the aircraft people take notice and want to join the bandwagon

4472081 the ministry of defence is conducting the static tests and they will decide on the timetable for the first flight
4472082 if the defence ministry is seen to be accepting an aircraft with defects it could lead to another investigation and thats something the government does not want right now also with money really tight right the ministry has to justify every purchase and it would be tough to do that if the problems persist
4472083 the problems are too serious to paper over from what i hear the first flight is likely to be delayed to the second half of 2008
4472084 we believe that there will be funding for additional aircraft in the next financial year and we hope to begin commercial production in 2009

4472090 people in greenville obviously have a good work ethic and know how to get things done
4472091 i would attribute this to the amount of coverage of the olympics and the fact that foreign affairs generally isnt of much interest to americans except under very unusual circumstances like the war in iraq

4472104 we have a pretty high nominal corporate tax rate but effectively its not high at all
4472105 there are many tax avoidance strategies wed be far better off with a simpler structure that made sure taxes were actually paid by corporations
4472106 the united states has the second highest combined statutory corporate tax rate among the organization for economic cooperation and development countries yet is tied with hungary in raising the fourth lowest amount of combined corporate income tax revenue relative to gdp in 2004

4472112 if i am an active citizen responsible parent and generally nice person then god will just have to take notice
4472113 for if a law had been given that could give life then righteousness would indeed be by the law but the scripture imprisoned everything under sin so that the promise by faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe

4472127 i had long wanted to do so however it needed mental and spiritual strength because this is not an easy thing because the consequence is incurring the wrath of god

4472139 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4472140 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4472141 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4472142 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4472143 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4472144 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4472145 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4472146 when i was looking at a list of boxing terminology i was interested to see how many expressions and sayings have come from the world of boxing initially i was going to simply write about the main types of punch probably the most common punches in boxing are the jab hook uppercut straight right or left a haymaker and a rabbit punch ok the jab is generally not a powerful punch it is a quick straight punch with the leading hand the hook is called so due to the curved motion the punch is thrown from shoulder and the arm comes round from the side an uppercut is punching from a low starting position and moving in an upward motion usually landing on the chin of the opponent up under their guard this is a powerful punch a straight is a powerful punch using the boxers dominant hand a haymaker is a rare punch and is a last resort in most cases this involves a wild swing and an extremely powerful punch with all the boxers weight behind it if landed it can be a knockout punch but the punch is quite obvious and slow so leaves the boxer exposed to a sucker punch finally the illegal punch the back of the head and the kidney areas are not allowed to be hit but on occasions sneaky fighters target these areas when close to the opponent or in a clinch these illegal shots if considered serious can result in a deduction of points punching below the waist line is not allowed in boxing and the common phrase below the belt arose from this it is an illegal and unpleasant thing so if you say something and another person proclaims that it was below the belt then you probably went a bit over the top and said something offensive another commonly used phrase is to throw the towel in which a boxer traditionally does when he doesnt wish to continue the fight he throws his towel into the ring this is used in all walks of life to imply giving up when a boxer is knocked to the canvas the floor the referee begins counting if he arrives at 10 before the pugilist gets back on his feet it is declared a knock out the term out for the count is commonly used to suggest someone is in a deep sleep there are many other boxing expressions and terminology these are just a few of the most common ones that im familiar with

4472153 they russian troops are controlling the city were not allowed to fight them there are troops in the city checking passports and the number plates of cars

4472159 the multi layered security platform that was implemented by the caribbean to host 2007 cricket world cup cwc saw the establishment of the jrcc this centre utilised a number of watch lists including interpols database to check every passenger arriving in the region or traveling throughout the region by air and sea caricom heads of government have already agreed that the jrcc which is headquartered in barbados will remain as a permanent structure the other agency to remain is the regional intelligence fusion centre rifc

4472165 what i find most disturbing is not the issue of the denial of entry of caricom citizens at the various ports of entry in the community but the humiliation suffered at the hands of some of the immigration officers at these ports
4472166 a number of guyanese have complained about the treatment they received at the hands of immigration authorities in barbados though these complaints have declined they have begun to emerge from guyanese attempting to enter trinidad and tobago tt with a group of guyanese recently complaining about the treatment they received when they attempted to enter tt for employment purposes
4472167 there had been prolonged discussions between caricom member states and cwc officials long before the commencement of the tournament in respect to this issue these discussions had clarified the role and responsibility of the national police forces in relation to enforcement of law and order and the primacy of the police in respect to national security within any host country over and above the role of cwc officials or private security the deputy prime minister stated that the authority of the police was a fundamental element of national law that could not be ignored she added that there will be dialogue with cwc officials to ensure that such action will not be repeated

4472180 when we all got to the top we let out a war cry
4472181 it was an easier hike than i am used to but it was still fun i had a lot of fun with climbing the rock face and getting to repel down the other side of the rock face
4472182 its a way for us to say thanks to all of our veterans
4472183 its a fun day and a way for us to help the golf course
4472184 the more burials you do the more you get used to the mechanics of dealing with the remains but there is still a human context to your reaction
4472185 we are looking at the bones of an individual and you can see them as a whole person
4472186 these sarcophagi would have been a prominent feature of the landscape as they were carefully placed to be viewed being close to the road and at the time raised above the ground
4472187 they would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community perhaps at fort commander level or at senior level in the roman army
4472188 very few people could have afforded to bury their child in such a grand fashion
4472189 for the first time we are starting to understand the layout of the civilian settlement that provided services to the garrison of the fort and we can catch a glimpse of the roman way of life and death on the northern frontier of the empire
4472190 electro glass is a highly respected company known for its honesty

4472194 southeast document services has steadily grown in the atlanta market and i am confident that this will be a beneficial addition to 3gs
4472195 our offense is so strong and that was definitely a key because they put some runs on the board early and were ready to go i knew it was my job to just get them back in the dugout so they could keep doing what they do so well my arm is feeling great and its just an amazing feeling because i am at the olympics
4472196 these missions highlight the strategic importance of the c 17 and the unique capability of our air force
4472197 this particular mission is a testament to our flexibility and ability to rapidly deploy combat airlift capability whenever and wherever its needed i am extremely proud of the exceptional accomplishments of the airmen of the 4th airlift squadron and the deployed team mcchord airmen supporting them
4472198 despite expectations of a worsening macro economic environment and evidence of deceleration of u s e commerce in certain sectors such as personal computers we continue to believe that the retail e commerce sector has a very high degree of recession downturn resistance

4472203 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4472204 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but the strategic potential of russia
4472205 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values
4472206 if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere

4472208 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4472209 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4472210 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4472211 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4472212 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4472213 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4472214 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4472215 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4472216 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4472217 destruction to our concession stand destruction to our dugouts fields fence posts and the macadam that were standing on these are all safety concerns and definitely will delay the opening of not only a fall season but possibly next season at a cost that this league cannot afford

4472229 they said it was an act of nature and they were not responsible for any act of nature
4472230 i said why should we be penalized cause it went out by act of nature

4472232 hes got to fight for his place like everyone else hell be treated exactly the same as the other players i like to travel them all fairly

4472234 we have reached important agreements on natural gas and electricity issues god willing we will complete them as soon as possible

4472236 steve hadley the u s national security adviser voiced objections to ahmadinejads trip when he visited ankara a month ago
4472237 the attitude was weve allowed them to host iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki and irans top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili but having ahmadinejad was sending the wrong signal
4472238 however the turks explained that he had been pressing for a visit to turkey for a while and that they couldnt say no any longer to meet american reservations they promised they wouldnt sign any major energy deals apart from maybe something on electricity and would pressure ahmadinejad to accept the u n security council incentive package in exchange for suspending uranium enrichment
4472239 the solution should take into consideration the uneasiness of the international community as well as protecting irans legitimate rights within the scope of the treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons
4472240 we expect the negotiation process to continue with the good will of all parties and reach a positive outcome in a short term
4472241 we believe that dialogue is the best way to resolve the issue and we are always ready for dialogue
4472242 those who do not respect that will lose themselves there will be no change in the will of the iranian people

4472248 yes its true we have not settled the whole amount because we are currently experiencing a bit of cash flow problems but that should be sorted out very soon hence our plea to the clubs to exercise a bit of tolerance until the money problem is sorted out
4472249 we are certainly disturbed by these negative developments and would like to put the record straight that this is not the kind of relationship we would like to have with our partners
4472250 people who would kill their sisters or daughters for bringing shame on the family would do anything to avoid being labeled a debtor

4472303 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4472304 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4472305 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4472306 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth

4472316 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4472317 it was in the governments best interests to terminate the litigation by settling the plaintiffs claims
4472318 no decent law abiding government should ever be allowed to engage in this kind of secret and dangerous medical experimentation
4472319 must be larger we dont know the whole picture because the records were destroyed
4472320 who knew about lsd then two guys went stark raving mad
4472321 it tears my heart out what happened to this man that the government should behave so callously
4472322 he went off to paris met some people in a cafe americans who insisted on giving him a drink he had what sounds like an lsd experience which destroyed his life it makes me so angry its difficult to talk about it
4472323 it was like a breakthrough it all came pouring back suddenly he knew why he was so crazy we believe there are dozens perhaps hundreds of victims in a similar position to mr glickmans not knowing what happened we get phone calls regularly
4472324 the army and the cia fight these cases to the death its shameful they keep going until the plaintiffs drop dead or they wear down the other side because they cant afford the legal fees and they have the full force of the us justice department behind them
4472325 i didnt know until this year he had done it when it came to my attention because of the lawsuit and secondly there was no informed consent in the 1950s the way we have it today
4472326 even by the standards of the time camerons work was unethical
4472327 the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential
4472328 i dont believe in that after a person is gone we are absolutely opposed to any kind of clandestine misuse of human subjects in any experiment but i would like to separate that from the question of whether or not we should condemn ewen cameron
4472329 remember wt isnt a trailerpark its a state of mind

4472335 the hardened detective glanced at his rookie partner and mused that who ever had coined the term white as a sheet had never envisioned a bed accessorized with a set of hazelnut 500 count egyptian cotton linens from ralph lauren complimented by matching shams and a duvet cover nor the dismembered body of its current occupant
4472336 mike hummer had been a private detective so long he could remember preparation a his hair reminded everyone of a rat whod bitten into an electrical cord but he could still run faster than greased owl snot when he was on a bad guys trail and they said his friskings were a lot like getting a vasectomy at sears

4472370 there has been a lot of misinformation circulating about plasma hdtvs and longevity and were happy to once again set the record straight on the durability of panasonic plasma
4472371 quite simply our plasma tvs are built to last a very long time as much as 100 000 hours to half their brightness
4472372 they are growing with e commerce we have them growing faster than credit card or debit card payments but they are starting from a smaller base
4472373 so far it has been fabulous and that type of success breeds on itself
4472374 disappointed at the defendants continued resistance to provide the information
4472375 a good middle ground is to keep the courts out of it
4472376 you spend all your time convincing the yeast the fruit apples etc are grapes
4472377 we were up in the air and two guys who were surprisingly a lot older than us started fights
4472378 then we had to be redirected to venice for a couple of hours the police came on and had to get them off
4472379 they had a couple of drinks on them they were extremely aggressive one of the guys half way through the flight stood up and started smashing the overhead compartments
4472380 the incident occurred in italian airspace at approximately 10pm irish time where a number of passengers were involved in an incident on board
4472381 the captain then made the decision for the safety of all on board to divert to venice where the aircraft was met by members of the italian police
4472382 five people were removed from the aircraft by italian police and the remaining passengers continued their flight approximately two hours later and have arrived safely in heraklion

4472392 gonzalez is te goed om zich zo te moeten gedragen
4472393 this serious collision tragically caused life threatening injuries to the rider of the motorcycle and we urgently need to talk to anyone with information that may help us with our investigation
4472394 an increasing of our offshore reserves of oil and gas is not the long term answer but effective action in the short term while we pursue this all of the above strategy
4472395 my response to the department of energy is lets try it lets try everything lets drill and drill now
4472396 sen obama said the surge wouldnt work that it would fail he voted to cut off funding for the men and women serving in iraq he refuses to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded
4472397 his recommended course of action has been called by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as a course very dangerous for america so i think hes wrong and i think he used the issue of iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party
4472398 at this time last year when i was here not only was i declared dead but i was reminded of the words of chairman mao who once said its darkest before its totally black
4472399 i think they want to have a situation that sends a message to the other nations in the region the baltics ukraine etc that they are now reasserting their traditional role of the russian empire in the region
4472400 ensuring that officers are protected in their collective bargaining and due process rights
4472401 i have always been proud to stand strong for new jerseys law enforcement officers the bush administration has been no friend to law enforcement but these men and women in uniform know that they will always have an ally in frank lautenberg i will keep fighting to boost community policing require background checks at gun shows support a ban on assault weapons work to take cop killer handguns off our streets and stop suspected terrorists from buying guns our police officers deserve every bit of support we can give them to help keep them and our communities safe
4472402 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4472403 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4472404 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4472405 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4472406 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4472407 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4472408 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4472409 hes preparing himself to be a great candidate and make sure he doesnt undermine the ability to do the right thing for the economy
4472410 is not unwilling to refine a position to reconsider points of view as you go forward
4472411 i seriously have to question mr obamas judgment if thinks he can learn anything about how to run the nations economy from jon corzine
4472412 thanks to corzine and the liberal democrats running this state new jersey has the third highest debt in the nation the highest property taxes and is and is among the most overregulated states in america
4472413 our team in new jersey knows that strong organizations are built from the bottom up not the top down and we look forward to working with area supporters as we grow our grassroots campaign to end the failed policies of the past and bring change we can believe in
4472414 det var da ogs rgerligt n r vi nu lige skulle til at lave rigtig mad
4472415 i want the department of transportation to give priority to those public transit projects which add to our system of national security

4472417 countrywide financial is at the center of the housing mortgage crisis which has helped throw our economy into recession a crisis that garrett until recently termed fear mongering

4472420 because the kingdom has not been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the united states
4472421 i am proud of my work to reduce our nations dependence on oil
4472422 as american families struggle with gas prices in 2008 president bush is pushing a plan that wont produce a drop of oil until 2017 and wont lower gas prices ever
4472423 to bring down artificially high gas prices in the near term we must crack down on speculation in the oil markets
4472424 one thing weve learned is that we cant trust the bush administration especially when it comes to our civil liberties
4472425 this bill gives the president too much power to spy on americans with no accountability
4472426 because he believes it to be a law enforcement tool necessary to protect the country against terrorist attacks
4472427 chose to cast a dangerously irresponsible vote against the interest of our national security
4472428 as gas prices continue to soar more and more new jersey residents are burdened by economic troubles it makes sense for us to at least explore our own deep sea energy sources
4472429 in the past 25 years our technology has improved dramatically yet over 80 percent of americas deep ocean areas are closed to responsible investigation
4472430 frank lautenberg had his chance and failed he has not fixed new jerseys problems
4472431 if you elect me as your congressman i will fight every day for fiscal responsibility and for families from hawthorne to the jersey city heights to get back more of their hard earned money the only way the ninth district will not get shortchanged again is to change from 12 years of empty promises from steve rothman that has left new jerseyans with little more than pocket change
4472432 too many unregistered ships bring illegal drugs to our shores and our neighborhoods
4472433 the senator hes old school he came from the business world so he does stress a professional atmosphere
4472434 as the grandson of italian immigrants i am proud that congress has joined me in posthumously awarding constantino brumidi with an honor reserved for the most distinguished individuals and institutions
4472435 fiscal irresponsibility and deficit spending is a matter of national security because it undermines the viability of our economy

4472440 gas is a huge issue in new jersey and frank lautenberg has failed to anything significant to alleviate the supply problem or the demand problem during his 24 years in the senate i think we need a senator who can support more focused and intensive efforts in this regard
4472441 she was truly powerful in being the visual face of what mental illness looks like it doesnt have two heads or warts on its face or drool down its mouth it looks like a typical child
4472442 could this bill have changed the outcome for yolanda no one knows but i think it will impact other children very positively
4472443 we have been able to work with the legislature on an issue that highlights the crisis in mental health and enact a bill to start to address this
4472444 the governor has been generally supportive of this important legislation but we have not seen the final version and the governor will need to review it
4472445 were hoping for the best but sometimes you win and sometimes you lose

4472450 its very aggravating to me that we are only getting bits and pieces i dont believe he is having selective memory recall
4472451 a lot of times people dont have the opportunity to hear the truth in their own tragedies
4472452 but i believe my family we are now being given an opportunity to know the truth there are so many people focused on finding the truth that i just have to believe that the truth will be revealed

4472459 we believe the jail calls were lawfully recorded and obtained and that they are important pieces of evidence to evaluate the mental state of the defendant in the aftermath of the murder
4472460 as a practical matter people who are incarcerated have very little freedom to communicate with people about their case and other things as well

4472462 from the point of view of the library boston has it all

4472464 the community library system is something that im just passionate about
4472465 your statements and appearances in the media have been instruments in creating fear anxiety and segregation in a community where citizens should be living in peace and harmony with each other
4472466 the hispanic community will continue to have a voice in the carcieri administration
4472467 we believe this is causing a stigma around the immigrant population and we dont want to be part of it
4472468 enable me to make a sounder decision about the facts of the case
4472469 never intended to release important information that would allow or teach a bad guy
4472470 we simply want them to provide the information thats been requested by the court or the mbta
4472471 preventing them from talking about what they found even though theres a public debate if these students figured it out other people could figure it out too
4472472 we felt there was sufficient evidence to back it up
4472473 freely sharing with him confidential proprietary and trade secret information
4472474 a jury made a decision and now we have to deal with that
4472475 the lack of awareness adds to the hiv threat they face

4472483 on average soda drinkers tend to eat more calories consume more saturated fat and trans fat eat less fiber exercise less and be more sedentary
4472484 im drinking diet soda so i dont need to be careful about the other things that i eat and drink
4472485 only you and your doctor can determine your actual risk
4472486 on average soda drinkers tend to eat more calories consume more saturated fat and trans fat eat less fiber exercise less and be more sedentary
4472487 maybe drinking something sweet conditions you in such a way that you develop a preference for sweet things
4472488 see people who drink diet soda get fat so what people eat and how much they weigh are unrelated

4472495 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4472496 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4472497 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4472498 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4472499 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4472500 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4472501 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4472502 we both supported each other 100 percent and we just wanted to go out there and give it our all and have fun because this is the games
4472503 the problem has been very serious for the past many years we contractors do have a lot of problems with the awarding officers most of whom are civil servants most of them want to benefit from where they have not sowed so after paying social insurance dues taxes and others most of the money for contracts ends up in the pockets of civil servants
4472504 the chiefs are not supposed to force contractors to pour libation thereby putting a lot of huddles on them some of them go very far by asking for lump sums of money
4472505 have you ever heard of 20 or 30 percent that is what they were asking so if you have already paid fcfa 2 million out of fcfa 10 million for taxes and some body is again asking you for 20 or 30 percent of the balance than you already know how much you are losing
4472506 i dont think people are going to switch over to bikes because its good for them or because its politically correct theyre going to do it because it gets them from a to b faster
4472507 it feels good if the weathers o k and if you see something that interests you you just stop
4472508 now its cool in different ways for some people its cool if you have an old junker for other people its cool if you have a racing bike

4472524 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4472525 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4472526 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4472527 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely

4472539 the few years that we have competed with each other weve both wanted it so bad that we push each other so much i think that we became better and stronger gymnasts because of each other
4472540 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail wanting you to make you work even harder
4472541 we have both made each other a stronger athlete a stronger person

4472548 students need to comprehend that it is lack of judgment not only lack of skill that increases the risk of injury to oneself and others not wanting something bad to happen is simply not enough
4472549 in addition to giving teens the knowledge and teaching them the technical skills injury prevention programs must also address teens attitudes about being immune to illness and death as a means of changing high risk behaviors such as driving while impaired
4472550 i told him we had a string quartet and soprano we discussed the words and i urged him strongly to have a maritime theme to tie it in to newburyport
4472551 we often like to use a guest instrument and this would tie in with everything else because the series is focusing on the concept of voice
4472552 i tend to need or want more time rather than less to write as i get older
4472553 i like to think im getting better and more attentive to detail
4472554 what i loved most aside from the moment by moment roll of the language was the motion in them through one evolving metaphor with the first poem in which crows sailing into the sky over a cemetery in winter are somehow suggestive of the sea
4472555 moving through the second in which an actual encounter with the ocean sends us into the depths of our own imaginations to the third where the solitary meeting of the ocean at night acts as an agent of transcendence ending with the mythic utterance of our ultimate openness to the presence of god
4472556 there are as many different ways to combine text and music as there are composers
4472557 the trick is to strike the right balance you want to float not be tossed around so much in the chop of the writing what i wanted musically was to give the words room to do their thing while amplifying their sense and subtext
4472558 we promise not to let our daughters marry the pagan people of the land nor to let our sons marry their daughters we further promise that if the people of the land should bring any merchandise or grain to be sold on the sabbath or on any other holy day we will refuse to buy it and we promise not to do any work every seventh year and to cancel the debts owed to us by other jews
4472559 remember that in a race everyone runs but only one person gets the prize you also must run in such a way that you will win all athletes practice strict self control they do it to win a prize that will fade away but we do it for an eternal prize so i run straight to the goal with purpose in every step i am not like a boxer who misses his punches i discipline my body like an athlete training it to do what it should otherwise i fear that after preaching to others i myself might be disqualified
4472560 as followers of moses they were all baptized in the cloud and the sea and all of them ate the same miraculous food and all of them drank the same miraculous water for they all drank from the miraculous rock that traveled with them and that rock was christ
4472561 if you think you are standing strong be careful for you too may fall into the same sin but remember that the temptations that come into your life are no different from what others experience and god is faithful he will keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you cant stand up against it when you are tempted he will show you a way out so that you will not give in to it
4472562 fear the lord you his saints for those who fear him lack nothing
4472563 if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor he too will cry out and not be answered

4472572 so on october 8 ezra the priest brought the scroll of the law before the assembly which included the men and women and all the children old enough to understand he faced the square just inside the water gate from early morning until noon and read aloud to everyone who could understand all the people paid close attention to the book of the law
4472573 dont be dejected and sad for the joy of the lord is your strength
4472574 just as farm workers who plow fields and thresh the grain expect a share of the harvest christian workers should be paid by those they serve
4472575 yet we have never used this right we would rather put up with anything than put an obstacle in the way of the good news about christ
4472576 in him our hearts rejoice for we are trusting in his holy name

4472588 after being compared to jay leno for so long you dont think of yourself in that way
4472589 you know ive been into chinese medicine for about 20 years and that along with eating right and exercise has helped me face up to aging with a certain amount of acceptance i wanted to age with grace and most of all dignity i mean i think its an important message for young women now who are rushing off to plastic surgeons when theyre still young
4472590 oh god you just mentioned my two favorites i cant get over your saying that you know years ago there was supposed to be a musical version of bus stop it was going to be called cherie her characters name i went up for it and got it but the show never happened

4472594 after a while if you are lucky enough to have lasted and if your work has been meaningful you have to protect yourself you have to be willing not to work rather than become something you are not when i show up onscreen i want people to know thats lesley ann warren and take it from there

4472633 we were trying to think of a way to make our hand knotted rosaries different you know carding wool yarn from the family sheep or something and little jim came up with this hes learning how to tie his shoelaces anyway so it was like killing two birds with one stone
4472634 when you live in the culture of death sometimes you need the strength of the blessed mothers intercession so you bend down tighten your shoelaces and say a few hail marys im sure this will increase vocations
4472635 they deserved it i know but i was really proud of our familys illuminated catechism

4472650 all das ist irgendwie nicht sehr ernst in amerika ist die wahlkampagne im gange vorl ufig kann nur die wto als wirklich ernst aufgenommen werden
4472651 wenn die olympischen spiele in sotschi n chstes jahr stattf nden w rde das thema boykott gewiss sofort auf dem ersten platz stehen aber sotschi ist bei uns f r 2014 vorgesehen es wird sich noch etliche pr sidenten abl sen

4472662 work expands to fill and often exceed the time allowed
4472663 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4472664 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4472665 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4472666 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4472667 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4472668 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4472669 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4472670 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4472671 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4472672 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps

4472674 fr johnston has strenuously denied on more than one occasion any abuse or improper action against either complainant
4472675 regarding the letter of apology father johnston has advised on more than one occasion that this letter written without a specific context was not an apology for any action of abuse i advised each claimant to go to the police with any allegations and any evidence they feel they have
4472676 there is no specific underlying story behind the few execs leaving our company
4472677 result in late feedback of critical elements much later in the life cycle when the information is actually used by a stakeholder in development or testing
4472678 just because theyre pretty much household names it doesnt mean their it department is completely organized
4472679 some have a very good quality assurance department others have a very good development organization but that doesnt mean everything is moving along in a precise fashion
4472680 for a long time the approach was lets just throw some code together because all these new languages like c and java were coming out and they were supposed to make development easier
4472681 enterprises fell victim to the false promises of the web making things easier
4472682 it did but it also made things far more complex you need more system integration use cases and testing
4472683 la operaci n material de demano nos recuerda mediante objetos de particular belleza la importancia que tiene para nuestro futuro como raza la pr ctica del reciclaje y la reutilizaci n de los bienes de consumo
4472684 it exaggerates only a little to say that americans in their 20s and early 30s divide into two groups of about equal size those who are married the majority of whom participate in religion and those who are not married the majority of whom do not participate
4472685 marriage is a gateway into family life and family life in turn is often a gateway into church attendance
4472686 the longer people postpone marriage the less likely they are to attend church at a given age and also the less likely they are to attend church down the road
4472687 one thing churches need to do is to really encourage their teenagers and their young adults not to buy into this culture of hooking up and even the culture of dating or just hanging out
4472688 churches need to create a culture of courtship that puts them on a path to marriage for those who are called to marriage
4472689 i think connecting young adults to families who have different priorities and different challenges and different joys would help them see the world a little bit differently and hopefully grow in their faith at the same time
4472690 we hope the suspicion that fascism is being reborn in a different form proves to be untrue

4472697 microbilt sent us a list of about 7 000 names and after we took out any duplicate names the list worked out to about 5 000

4472711 were certainly looking at a number of further allegations and making inquires in relation to that
4472712 as far as the likelihood of a timeframe of any further arrests thats something i cant comment on at this stage
4472713 the police have been working with a number of victims and if there are any others out there we would certainly encourage them to come forward
4472714 han hecho comentarios mal sanos orientados a deslegitimar a la instituci n
4472715 lo m s grave de todo esto es que estas maquinaciones hacen eco o son difundidas por personas que por su investidura est n llamadas como ninguna otra a cooperar con los jueces a respaldar sus determinaciones y a velar por que estas se cumplan a riesgo de que toda institucionalidad democr tica del pa s naufrague
4472716 en colombia ha habido clientelismo la idea es c mo podemos reglamentar eso de manera clara abierta y con transparencia

4472719 siempre ser bienvenidas las propuestas para erradicar cualquier tipo de pr ctica irregular y por supuesto los jueces nunca vamos a negarnos pero ojo que el asunto hay que mirarlo de manera integral como un fen meno que afecta no s lo a la rama judicial sino a la rama ejecutiva y legislativa

4472798 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4472799 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4472800 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4472801 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4472802 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4472803 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4472804 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4472805 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4472806 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4472807 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4472808 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4472809 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4472810 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4472811 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4472812 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4472813 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4472814 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4472815 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4472816 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4472817 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4472818 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4472819 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4472820 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4472821 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4472822 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4472823 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4472854 these three hmong american men from st paul who were u s citizens were traveling to laos in 2007 as tourists and looking for business opportunities when they were arrested by lao military and security forces
4472855 we are calling on the lao government to immediately release these american citizens who were non political and merely seeking to travel as tourists
4472856 sadly after almost one terribly difficult and long year the lao lpdr government and its military and security services still continue to offer absolutely no help or factual information regarding the three hmong americans from st paul that it arrested and jailed in laos in 2007
4472857 the lao government is covering up the truth about this matter and continues to imprison these hmong men despite their families efforts to have them released and returned home to minnesota
4472858 i want to thank congressman dana rohrabacher congressman frank wolf congressman patrick kennedy congresswoman tammy baldwin and other members of the u s house of representatives for co hosting todays u s congressional forum on laos in cooperation with mr philip smith executive director of the center for public policy analysis dr jane hamilton merritt lao hmong scholar vaughn vang of the lao human rights council of wisconsin and minnesota khamphet moukdarath of the united league for democracy in laos and t kumar advocacy director of amnesty international i appreciate their leadership on the current human rights crisis in laos especially facing the hmong people and the serious situation regarding the arrest and imprisonment in laos of my husband hakit yang and his two hmong american colleagues from st paul minnesota last year the u s government granted normalized trade relations ntr to laos in 2005 today it encourages citizens to consider foreign investments in the communist state despite the countrys atrocious human rights records and the unjustified arrest jailing and continued detention of three hmong american citizens from st paul minnesota including my husband mr hakit yang on july 10 2007 hakit yang congshineng yang and trillion yuhaison departed the united states for laos to pursue business investment opportunities the men were staying at the 5 guest house in phousavan laos when they were arrested by secret police forces they were detained in phonthong prison and later transferred to an unknown destination several unofficial reports suggest they are being detained in the north of laos near the vietnam border the last phone call and communication was received from yuhaison on august 26 2007 at approximately 9 00 am cst yuhaison called hakits older brother xai yang and stated that he was calling from a security guards cell phone and confirmed that all three men had been arrested without warrant yuhaison sounded very worried and wanted xai to contact the u s embassy in vientiane right away a us embassy staff confirmed with local lao authorities that three us citizens were arrested however the authorities refused to release any names according to the u s embassy the ministry of foriegn affairs could not confirm the situation over the phone but it appeared they knew about the cases the u s embassy contacted the lao government who denied having any record of the men entering their country and any u s citizens being detained or arrested later the lao government changed their previous denials and admitted that the men did indeed entered laos but allegedly claimed that they had allegedly departed laos via the lao thai friendship bridge on august 29 2007 despite repeated requests from the us embassy no departure cards have ever been produced as evidence for their departure other documents produced are clearly bogus and fabricated allegedly claiming to support the lao governments false claims that my husband and the other two departed from laos to thailand which is not factual it has been many months since the arrest and disappearance of hakit yang congshineng yang and trillion yuhaison to this day our family has not received any concrete answers from the us embassy in laos nor the state department i have been in contact with the other mens families and they also have not received any answers the us government and us embassy have a responsibility to inform us citizens that there are no real protections in place to safeguard their civil and legal rights the us government has failed to properly hold the laos government accountable for the disappearance of these us investors hakit congshineng and trillion represent the first of many us investors and tourists to travel to laos under the new normalised trade relations agreement but their disappearance clearly proves that no us citizen is safe in laos and no us citizen should invest in the current lao regime until proper protections can be put in place to safeguard the civil legal and human rights of all us citizens traveling to laos i respectfully ask that the us government and us embassy in laos continue to investigate the arrest and disappearance of hakit congshineng and trillion and to press the lao government for humanitarian access to the three u s citizens and their unconditional and immediate release the lao government continues to jail my husband and the two other americans from st paul that he was traveling with in clear violation and contempt of international law lao and hmong americans should not invest in the current regime in laos the lao peoples democratic republic ntr trade status to laos should be revoked by the u s congress and u s foreign aid and assistance to the lao regime should also be cut by the u s congress and u s government completely including all de mining funding until at least such time as my husband hakit yang congshineng and trillion as hmong american citizens are released from prison in laos and brought home safely to america and their homes and families in st paul minnesota we will not forget and not give up fighting until we have truthful answers and the lao regime releases hakit yang congshineng and trillion we appeal to the u s congress the u s government and international community for assistance in pressing the lao regime to release our family members and restore human rights and freedom to them so that we can be reunited and these american citizens can return home once again from this terrible darkness

4472965 i believe you have every right to expect excellent performance from windows vista and im going to back that conclusion in todays post the latest in my fixing vista series with details on how to use vistas built in tools to find and fix the problems that stand between you and an excellent vista experience specifically i believe all of the following statements should be true on a new pc built with up to date hardware windows vista should start up in a minute or less and shut down in 30 seconds or less video performance and audio playback should be smooth and glitch free programs should open quickly and do their work without affecting your ability to perform other tasks file transfer speeds should be limited only by the capabilities of your hardware disk controller and network system crashes should be nonexistent and application crashes should hang the faulting program only without affecting other programs if any of those conditions fail you have a pc that needs fixing despite what you might read from self proclaimed experts there is no secret formula magic bullet or special makerocketshipgofast registry hack that will suddenly send your system zooming into warp speed nor do you need third party diagnostic or repair software instead the formula for getting excellent performance out of a windows vista pc is much more prosaic start with quality components make sure every piece of hardware has the right drivers and every piece of software is up to date and fix any performance bottlenecks

4472979 the centre had on thursday announced to accept the recommendations of the sixth pay commission we are examining that
4472980 it was not easy for he is the world champion but once i levelled the score i knew i cannot lose
4472981 its not possible to assure you of the gold but i can tell you that im here to win only gold
4472982 i know things would not be easier in fact it would get even more difficult from now onwards but im here to do my job and return with the gold if luck decides the outcome i may return with the bronze but if confidence is the determining factor gold is mine
4472983 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4472984 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4472985 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4472986 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4472987 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4472988 that was heat of the moment stuff he hit it right at me
4472989 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its part of the game you were on top of the game
4472990 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4472991 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4472992 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4472993 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player
4472994 i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played
4472995 if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way

4473000 in clear terms i want to say here that at no point the state government will bow down before any such individual or organisations who have no faith on democracy who are engaged in violence or who are traitors
4473001 the people of the state will also not excuse them
4473002 today was the day to remember the valour and patriotism of the people who had liberated us from the britishers
4473003 the people of the country have not yet actually been liberated
4473004 the local population seems genuinely proud of the fact that their country is hosting the rest of the world the average person seems to be stepping over themselves to try and give you a good impression of their city
4473005 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4473006 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4473007 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
4473008 we think there is a defect in their kidneys in the normal mechanisms that allow them to excrete salt
4473009 when blood pressure goes up due to stress their kidneys ought to get rid of more salt so their blood pressure will come down and they dont
4473010 we have animal model data that says the endothelin system normally functions to help your kidneys get rid of salt
4473011 from our point of view angiotensin promotes sodium retention directly and it also increases aldosterone another hormone which promotes sodium retention
4473012 ultimately you want to know how to treat people with this variation
4473013 there is still a need to figure out why some people respond to some therapies and other dont
4473014 that is not our specific question but these studies will help address that we have to identify what is it about different individuals that make them react more to stress makes them retain more salt
4473015 we are arguing in our study that you might want to treat patients differently depending on whether or not they are obese the angiotensin receptor blocker may be more effective in obese individuals who have angiotensin falling out into their bloodstream
4473016 we also found out that endothelin actually is the stimulus for increasing reactive oxygen species
4473017 when we gave the rats a specific type of endothelin blocker that also blocked the increase in oxidative stress blocked the blood pressure increase and improved recovery
4473018 this early life stressor is being mediated through the endothelin pathway
4473019 we took that to mean their blood pressure could also be hyper reactive sure enough that is what we found
4473020 this has a lot of implications for earlier detection of risk increasing environmental exposures and what you can do about it
4473021 if you cant alter the environment that quickly in life you know now where they are headed and maybe you can preempt it pharmacogenetically
4473022 what we are doing is looking at chronic environmental stress in combination with some bad candidate genes that are stress activated
4473023 if you have a tendency to have high blood pressure or if you are obese we can see the inner layer of the carotid getting thicker than normal people your age
4473024 itd be very very difficult for us to put it out
4473025 because there is so much environmental impact around that why would we want to eat anything that comes out of the ground here

4473030 people know he has no license no solid waste permit no certification and no town permit and they still do nothing
4473031 why do we have these laws on the books that are being completely ignored
4473032 what is the point if no one has the authority or desire to enforce them
4473033 but if you dont have the staff that are skilled and able to follow through on things its problematic
4473034 if this guy goes out of business today or tomorrow or next week i dont know bake sale how else are you going to get all those tires out of there
4473035 what youve got here is see if you can kick the shit out of one yard so that you can kick the shit out of all the rest
4473036 theyre relentless they seem to get all charged up by creating hate and discontent
4473037 youd have to be na ve to think that youre gonna find water that tests like mountain water where nothing but the birds and the bees have been
4473038 if i lived to be twice the age of methuselah i might be able to remove all those tires
4473039 but if i should lose my appeal against the town the judge is gonna have to find the money because i aint got it and im not gonna work the rest of my remaining years just to piss it away
4473040 we look at junkyards now and its really a solid waste issue
4473041 when you deal with stuff like that the people who are really better suited for it are people in natural resources
4473042 we didnt do that because frankly we were concerned that wed end up owning the property and assuming any liability
4473043 i think everyone is in the process of trying to determine whats there and that information is slowly but surely coming out
4473044 a lot of things now being done could have been done a long time ago and are beyond our resources to do
4473045 no one has had to shut down a junkyard and face the consequences of whos responsible for what
4473046 from our end of things what we want is compliance thats our main goal
4473047 dont just put it off on the state because keep in mind rhoades didnt pay his taxes for quite some time
4473048 the town could have taken the property and closed him down at any time they chose not to because they didnt want to be responsible for the tire pile
4473049 the same way the town doesnt have the funds to clean up all these tires
4473050 the state doesnt have a pool of money for removing these tires either
4473051 is inflamed by mystery suspicion and secrecy hard and exact facts will cool it

4473053 the problem is that theres absolutely no evidence they work
4473054 the idea of the act seems to be that most sex offenders have to be on the internet registry i dont think a lot of legislators have a problem with that

4473061 we really encourage our staff to start with where people are at
4473062 we ask that they assess peoples knowledge before they launch into an educational thing
4473063 that the next time your family goes to wic for a visit you can see a difference
4473064 after years of opposition to nuclear energy it appears gov jim doyle became the first democrat to abandon barack obamas no policy as americans continue to struggle with high energy prices
4473065 now willing to lift the nuclear moratorium doyles stance is more in line with senator john mccain who has called for 45 new nuclear power plants in the united states by 2030 we support doyles willingness to follow mccains leadership as he listens to wisconsinites in need of a solution to our energy crisis
4473066 its good to see senator mccains message of expanding the use of nuclear power is resonating in wisconsin
4473067 modify wisconsins current moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants to allow this option to be considered in the future
4473068 i dont know why politicians like to propose things that are going to cost their constituents money
4473069 all of the nuclear recommendations could only take place if we invest in energy efficiency as recommended by the task force and if wisconsin implements stronger requirements for renewable energy
4473070 one is that there are two steps that you can take right now that are more effective really positive steps those steps are energy efficiency and conservation and then moving toward a renewable homegrown energy portfolio
4473071 there are many steps that will require some sort of approval so its a question of how to package it and move it all for ward

4473074 students need to comprehend that it is lack of judgment not only lack of skill that increases the risk of injury to oneself and others not wanting something bad to happen is simply not enough
4473075 in addition to giving teens the knowledge and teaching them the technical skills injury prevention programs must also address teens attitudes about being immune to illness and death as a means of changing high risk behaviors such as driving while impaired

4473089 recent problems with wheat streak mosaic high plains virus and triticum mosaic virus in much of western and parts of central kansas remind us of the importance of controlling volunteer wheat well before this year s crop is planted
4473090 in most cases an infection of wheat streak mosaic can be traced to a nearby field of volunteer wheat although there are other hosts such as corn millet and many annual grasses such as yellow foxtail and prairie cupgrass control of volunteer is the main defense against the wheat streak mosaic virus complex
4473091 the wheat curl mite is the vector for both wheat streak mosaic the high plains virus and triticum mosaic virus the curl mite uses the wind to carry it to new hosts and can travel up to half a mile from volunteer wheat
4473092 hessian flies survive over the summer on wheat stubble when the adults emerge they can infest any volunteer wheat that may be present which will keep the hessian fly population alive and going through the upcoming crop season in years with a wet summer and or a long open fall there can be two broods of hessian fly in the fall and this is even more likely where volunteer is allowed to grow and become infested early
4473093 while this insect has wings and can be windborne for hundreds of miles the vast majority of fall infestations in kansas appear to originate from nearby infested volunteer
4473094 during some years infestations become established during late summer and early fall on volunteer wheat later as the quality of the volunteer deteriorates mites move from the volunteer into adjacent fields of planted wheat or other small grains occasionally mites will survive the winter and continue to spread into the planted wheat following greenup in the spring
4473095 where infested volunteer is allowed to grow right up until seedbed preparation just prior to planting early planted continuous wheat is likely to become infested similarly volunteer that is allowed to grow through the fall and into the following spring may also serve as an attractive chinch bug host

4473124 the lack of an effective framework for adaption in nsw is a major gap in the states response to climate change

4473126 it is a criminal offence and anyone siphoning water off illegally in my view should be locked up rather than the fines that i am told are currently in place
4473127 people must understand there simply is no water available to pump into ailing systems
4473128 there is no doubt consumer preferences have moved to smaller more fuel efficient cars
4473129 the combination of a carbon price under emissions trading and grants for research design and development can put us at the leading edge in being able to get a first responder advantage in the market
4473130 that is certainly one option which we would like to see considered
4473131 harmonisation and in some cases reduction of state charges would encourage new car purchases which has fuel efficiency outcomes
4473132 we want to move to low emission vehicles and we want to reduce the cost of cars
4473133 we want to take pressure off peoples wallets and take pressure off the environment
4473134 the worst criticism of a politician is when people say i dont know what he stands for
4473135 a politician needs to demonstrate a compass a set of beliefs and values that guides him or her so that in a storm the way ahead is clear people may not agree with the direction but they will expect politicians to know their minds
4473136 people are starting to believe that kevin rudd is all talk
4473137 your base your swing and those you will never persuade
4473138 in any campaign you have your base your swing and your enemies
4473139 you have to lock in your base persuade your swingers and neutralise your enemies
4473140 are you sure they labor wont switch leaders on you
4473141 1 terms would be enough and he would hand over to p c
4473142 there was no doubt in my mind peter costello would have contested the leadership had the above arrangements not been in place
4473143 he said he wasnt going and he entered the formula that he put down for a long time which was i will stay as long as its in the interests of my party and my party wants me to stay
4473144 but in all of these things you know what politics is like you always keep your options open
4473145 the coalitions poor standing over the course of the year
4473146 in the end we decided that unless the pm would say that he had decided to stand down then there would be no change
4473147 he would be seen by history as being a coward who feared losing his seat and losing the election and wouldnt stand and fight
4473148 mrs howard was there and she made that patently clear you cant ask him to walk out of a job after all hes done as a coward
4473149 wont serve another full term if he wins the election
4473150 quit politics as soon as his election program is implemented
4473151 if the australian people are good enough and kind enough to re elect me again there are a lot of things i want to do and i would want to approach those things with enormous energy but i would expect well into my term and after those things have been implemented and battered down i would probably certainly form the view well into my term that it makes sense for me to retire and in those circumstances i would expect although it would be a matter for the party to determine if peter would take over
4473152 no i wouldnt do that youre not going to resign because it would look like youre running away your colleagues have to ask you to leave thats the only way its going to happen not give you the discretion
4473153 the vast majority of them thought that we were going to lose and there was nothing john howard could do to turn it around and on balance but with a lot of reservations it might be better if costello took over although we could do worse with costello there was also a possibility that we could do a lot better depending on how he went in the transition
4473154 out of the blue because i didnt think that would have produced a different result and that i would have rightly been criticised for cowardice
4473155 the claim wrongly implies that mccain is proposing a special tax cut for oil companies he is not
4473156 people are starting to look at mccain and see how hes a real guy with real answers

4473179 the san bernardino valley lies only an hour east of los angeles by the san bernardino freeway but is in certain ways an alien place not the coastal california of the subtropical twilights and the soft westerlies off the pacific but a harsher california haunted by the mojave just beyond the mountains devastated by the hot dry santa ana wind that comes down through the passes at 100 miles an hour and whines through the eucalyptus windbreaks and works on the nerves
4473180 january 11 1965 was a bright warm day in southern california the kind of day when catalina floats on the pacific horizon and the air smells of orange blossoms and it is a long way from the bleak and difficult east a long way from the cold a long way from the past

4473200 the conservatives might think they can cheat during an election but they cannot cheat us with their embarrassing non plan for the military
4473201 just like when they broke the law during the last election the conservatives are using taxpayer dollars to mail out millions of political advertisements to canadians

4473236 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4473237 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4473238 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4473239 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4473240 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4473241 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
4473242 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
4473243 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
4473244 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
4473245 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
4473246 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4473247 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4473248 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4473249 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4473250 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4473251 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4473252 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4473253 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4473254 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4473255 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4473256 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4473257 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4473258 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4473259 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4473260 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4473261 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4473262 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4473263 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4473264 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4473265 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4473266 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4473267 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4473268 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4473269 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

4473283 the worlds first and only monthly newsletter exclusively devoted to successful ip marketing
4473284 this monthly guidance will help spur the commercialization of innovations and other ip
4473285 the need is greatest in the academic and government research sectors their budgets are under pressure but theyve got cabinets full of invention disclosures and patented innovations just gathering dust and bringing in no royalties more effective aggressive marketing is the missing link in the commercialization chain that will bring in more licenses and more royalty revenue
4473286 the european market especially germany spain and italy is the center of pv demand from 2006 to 2007 the european pv industrys capacity grew over 43 and is expected to continue this growth into the foreseeable future the need to expand spires reach into this critical marketplace is crucial
4473287 our spi sun simulators are truly leading edge this year alone they were chosen by the most technically demanding users such as the national renewable energy laboratory located in the united states and underwriters laboratories located in the both the united states and china spires spi sun simulators are used by crystalline silicon module manufactures worldwide as well as leading thin film producers such as first solar
4473288 in short while we recognize that we cannot devise a net metering plan that will satisfy everyone we believe that it is time to implement net metering with an eye toward a further evaluation of the efficacy of its use once it has been in place for a period of time
4473289 that these advanced renewable tariffs should be based upon the specific production costs of each particular generation technology include a return comparable to the utilities allowed returns and be fixed over a period of time that allows for full recovery of capital costs
4473290 recognized that advanced renewable tariffs would likely result in increased costs per unit of electrical output compared to utility scale renewable projects but that these costs are justified by the economic and environmental advantages from encouraging distributed small scale generation
4473291 this is significant for south carolina with rising energy costs net metering can further reduce solar customers energy bills by up to 30 percent because those systems can feed more energy into the grid than they could keep in batteries
4473292 i see this giving customers much more of a choice previously you had to get into systems that were pretty complex using net metering you can put up a system that is pretty straightforward and simple
4473293 obviously were very pleased that there are more renewable energy options available in south carolina it is still in its early stages but were encouraged by the response from the utilities and from the public
4473294 in short while we recognize that we cannot devise a net metering plan that will satisfy everyone we believe that it is time to implement net metering with an eye toward a further evaluation of the efficacy of its use once it has been in place for a period of time
4473295 during our first month of the program we had 60 inquiries two customers have signed up and four or five more are in the process it takes time to establish a program like this but were very optimistic about the future of the program

4473300 pg amp es announcement represents the largest single photovoltaic commitment from an electric utility anywhere in the world
4473301 it represents the pinnacle in a series of large and innovative u s electric utility solar projects that have been announced in the last six months
4473302 these two solar project configurations represent competing technology advancements we have seen in the photovoltaic industry recently
4473303 each is aiming for the lowest cost per kilowatt hour but have diverging techniques for getting there optisolars thin film technology is lower efficiency but the panels and installation configuration are designed to minimize costs sunpowers technology is the highest commercial efficiency in the industry which commands a premium price but with the tracking technology they are aiming to produce more kilowatt hours per solar panel
4473304 pg amp es solar portfolio has continued to grow year after year
4473305 they continually raise the bar for other utilities and send a clear message that solar electricity is an option to be taken seriously by all those in the energy business
4473306 disappointed at the defendants continued resistance to provide the information
4473307 a good middle ground is to keep the courts out of it
4473308 the unique thing about our group is that because we have these technically trained attorneys we can enter and be in a hazardous materials zone
4473309 we have the ability to go to the scene while the fires are still smoking
4473310 i have this problem in a bad way one moment ill have very strong 3g reception and in the next ill have dropped the signal and switched to edge i can barely keep a call from dropping on 3g and this is in san jose and san francisco metro not the back woods
4473311 honestly at this point im a lot happier just turning off 3g and running the thing on edge all the time battery life is much improved obviously without all the switching and most applications run at a reasonable speed most importantly calls dont drop
4473312 i really do hope i can use the 3g on my iphone 3g sometime soon though thats kinda why i bought it
4473313 its entirely possible that theres a huge problem with the chips the phones or the network
4473314 its also possible that the press is going to latch onto any problems with the iphone because writing the word iphone guarantees people read the article cell phone reception varies so i can only report on what im seeing i have used the iphone almost daily since i got it and have had bugs a lot of random slowness some minor app crashes and issues with the battery it dies before the end of the day and you cant carry a spare battery but ive had no problems with reception
4473315 it may have been a temporary glitch or volume overload
4473316 listening to your customers for a large corporation very important but why just for iphone users i am in possession of an htc diamond but say the direct counterpart of the iphone my range is dramatically bad
4473317 it is certainly not the iphone i have an mda vario iii and also has poor coverage in various places in the country
4473318 my main issue with all of this is apples complete and utter silence on the matter what would be the harm in acknowledging the issue and saying we will have a fix in short order it wouldnt hurt and most likely would garner apple more respect
4473319 wow those numbers are definitely impressive we all knew it was going to be successful but i doubt any of us would have predicted this
4473320 and this is with how shall i say a flood of less than stellar apps imagine how this store will do once it grows to include more useful applications
4473321 iinet is offering itunes content quota free which is great hopefully other isps will follow
4473322 my guess is that its not just apple its that the usage rules for online rentals are based on what the rights holders want and demand and what the infrastructure supports

4473333 even though guilt and shame are often interchangeably used each is a distinct emotion
4473334 participants who felt guilty about the impulse buying used proactive coping strategies such as adjusting budgets and planning to reduce impulse buying in the future on the other hand shameful buyers used more avoidant emotion focused strategies such as denial and reframing the incident to be less injurious to the self

4473336 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4473337 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4473338 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4473339 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4473340 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among preschool children the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it
4473341 more web sites are adopting recaptchas each day so the rate of transcription keeps growing
4473342 more than 4 million words are being transcribed every day it would take more than 1 500 people working 40 hours a week at a rate of 60 words a minute to match our weekly output
4473343 we are demonstrating that we can take human effort human processing power that would otherwise be wasted and redirect it to accomplish tasks that computers cannot yet solve
4473344 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4473345 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4473346 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4473347 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4473348 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time
4473349 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it

4473351 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4473352 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4473353 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4473354 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives

4473373 involved in their lives with their butlers and their valets and their breakfast in bed dressing for dinner and going to nightclubs and coming back late at night supper clubs cocktails piano bars that world for some reason clicked in for me

4473436 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4473437 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4473438 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4473439 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4473440 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4473441 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4473442 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4473443 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages

4473445 as a whole the study shows that a peaceful balanced and respectful family life is wished for these values are shared by muslims and the finnish population in general and may serve as a bridge between finnish law and islamic law
4473446 a significant amount of conflicts have to do with things that are not a duty of a muslim but instead are possible to do in the purview of islamic law
4473447 everyone has the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom either alone or in community with others and in public or private to manifest his religion or belief in teaching practice worship and observance
4473448 the fact that the low status of women in the muslim countries and muslim culture is simplistically connected to islam as a religion in the western rhetoric is not well based at all from the point of view of the most important islamic legalistic source the koran secondly in my opinion this doesnt in any way help the progress of womens rights riffat hassan has said that there are three things that make an average muslim woman in the world she is poor illiterate and lives in the countryside if a defender of human rights wants to liberate this muslim woman she cant do it by telling her about the un declaration of human rights because this doesnt mean anything to this woman but if she is told about the justness and mercy of allah and of the possibilities that her own religious frame of reference contains hope shall light in her eyes and at the same time these are the things secured by the international human rights as abdullahi has pointed out
4473449 we can enhance the status of muslim women both in muslim countries and in finland without denying the religion of islam by bringing to the fore the rules and instructions included in the koran that emphasize the equality between the sexes we can erode the foundations and justification of the traditions that violate the womens rights
4473450 by bringing to the fore the rules and instructions included in the koran that emphasize the equality between the sexes we can erode the foundations and justification of the traditions that violate the womens rights
4473451 practicing muslims are an integral and valuable part of the global community as well as essential to any movement for secular faith respecting states that work toward universal human rights we acknowledge the peaceful observance of islam to be a legitimate choice for many we stand by those who embrace an islam that defends critical thinking empathy justice and non violence they are our allies and we are theirs

4473453 following threats to our staff of a very serious nature
4473454 losing gsp plus would lead to a 4 cut in sri lankas garment exports
4473455 a nnual inflation is close to 30 the rupee has appreciated against the dollar further hurting exporters by one estimate economic growth which was 7 6 in 2006 will be 4 3 this year as elsewhere inflation is being driven by high food and energy prices
4473456 garments bound for british high streets represent one of sri lankas strengths an innovative garment industry which accounts for 67 of total industrial output and the equivalent of 10 of gdp
4473457 is waged mostly in the north and east leaving the populous well off west largely unscathed
4473458 beneficiaries must comply with 27 international conventions on environmental labor and human rights standards
4473459 sri lankas sovereignty and territorial integrity like those of serbia georgia and many others has always been contingent on these being sufficiently useful to all the great powers at the same time
4473460 the moment the emergence of tamil eelam becomes useful to any of the great powers a new game will begin
4473461 this is welcome news for motorists as all of the big four supermarket chains which represent 38 per cent of all fuel sales have now cut petrol prices
4473462 asda has dropped unleaded fuel costs for the second time to match morrisons while tesco with the most supermarket fuel courts has pledged to match the cheapest petrol price in each local area
4473463 with oil prices beginning to fall it is good to see these major retail players passing on savings to their consumers but are they doing enough to combat the 14pc fuel price increase we have already felt this year
4473464 its been very busy busier than this time last year
4473465 the enquiries have been from a range of people but we have had quite a lot of interest from those already living in suffolk and thats partly due to the current economic climate

4473475 we will not stand back and allow labour costs to determine whether contracts are won or lost
4473476 baa gatwick is disappointed to learn that the trade union representing some swissport employees has voted for strike action later this month
4473477 baa gatwick is working closely with the handling agent and the airlines it represents to minimise the potential impact on passengers planning to travel on the proposed strike dates
4473478 swissport believes that a fair offer has been made to the unions in the light of the current economic climate and one that reflects the cost of living increase
4473479 each condition of metabolic syndrome phenomenon high blood pressure type 2 diabetes and obesity independently raises the risk for erectile dysfunction just on their own
4473480 and so when all are present in combination as part of this syndrome you have a situation where you dont even need to be as diabetic or hypertensive as you might otherwise have to be to experience erectile dysfunction and that fact has been raising concern among clinicians
4473481 so we followed up on case reports and anecdotal evidence that statins being used to lower cholesterol over a six to eight week period among patients with metabolic syndrome seemed to also quickly improve erections even before cholesterol levels go down
4473482 and in an animal model we found this to be the case
4473483 statins are used by everyone under the sun and as far as i know theres been no hard evidence that it can be used to treat erectile dysfunction
4473484 on the other hand it may be that it could prevent or modify some of the other risk factors for erectile dysfunction
4473485 this is because we do know that an increase in rho kinase leads to heightened tone of the corpus smooth muscle which is one of the causes of erectile dysfunction
4473486 so while i wouldnt go too far with this and i would probably not see statins becoming a primary treatment for erectile dysfunction if these findings turn out to be true then there could perhaps be an additional good use for statins

4473488 both of these players are going to add size and depth to our roster for the 2008 2009 season
4473489 jamie is a big strong defenseman who can clear the front of the net and comes highly touted as a solid two way defenseman
4473490 derek is a big power forward with soft hands around the net
4473491 everyone we talk to about derek feels that he will be a big scorer in the pro game we look forward to him being in our line up
4473492 obviously yannick has proven he is a very good player and weve had a lot of desire to have him
4473493 hes the kind of player that can be a big impact for a team and were glad we were able to reach an agreement to bring him to our club unfortunately we had to give up not only quality players but quality individuals in return its the tough part of the business when you have to part with players who have meant as much to your club as those three have but we now look ahead and are excited to see what yannick will bring to our organization
4473494 i had the pleasure of coaching yannick at the all star game in stockton this past year and i was very impressed by his determination and drive to win a championship
4473495 personally im very excited to coach him and i think hell add a terrific offensive dynamic to our club at the same time the sad part is saying goodbye to quality players like mike jarret and steve and i wish them the very best
4473496 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4473497 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4473498 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4473499 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4473500 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4473501 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4473502 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4473503 we felt there was sufficient evidence to back it up
4473504 freely sharing with him confidential proprietary and trade secret information

4473519 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case

4473521 it would be foolish to deny that the prospects for american acceptance of such institutions as stoning or flogging or amputation are virtually nil at least for the foreseeable future
4473522 the second thing to keep in mind is that notions of what is cruel and unusual of what is barbaric of what is draconian which is the real basis upon which america rejects these punishments are a function of culture not law it is only through changes in american culture that american attitudes towards such things are likely to change
4473523 we have achieved what we set out to achieve in iraq
4473524 so it is possible to envisage a mission next year which is in the early hundreds
4473525 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint as a key coalition partner the u s is intimately involved with the development of our future plans
4473526 subject to security conditions on the ground our military commanders believe that the iraqis will be able to take over development of basra airport by the end of this year
4473527 as the focus shifts from training combat troops we will then move forward to the specific task of mentoring headquarters and specialist staff
4473528 as we complete these tasks and as progress continues across these different areas we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq

4473548 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4473549 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4473550 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4473551 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4473552 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4473553 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4473554 it was really one or two points and who played those one or two points better
4473555 you probably shouldnt be there because it would be uncomfortable for me it would be uncomfortable for john and potentially uncomfortable for you except maybe not because you arent ever uncomfortable and youre not bothered by circumstance
4473556 hmmm he was quiet when helping me today why u say i
4473557 i love all of u so i never punish any of u
4473558 hmm i guess after national day i may not coming to teach u for 2 weeks
4473559 among the intelligentsia colour feeling only occurs in the transposed form that is as a belief in the innate superiority of the coloured races even among those who do not feel strongly on the colour question snobbery and imitation have a powerful influence almost any english intellectual would be scandalized by the claim that the white races are superior to the coloured whereas the opposite claim would seem to him unexceptionable even if he disagreed with it
4473560 at a time when hes under investigation and running from revelations of election fraud and bribery the davis campaign is practicing the lowest form of politics by distorting simple facts
4473561 jon was written a ticket for jaywalking never arrested and never showed any disrespect to law enforcement
4473562 when you look at the full statute jaywalking is part of that statute
4473563 hindering or preventing the movement of persons on a public street
4473564 we need leaders in congress who believe in transparency and accountability
4473565 i wonder how many people at that press conference put their lives on the line in iraq how can they criticize someone who braved the horrors of that war and then willingly returned to help the many children from families that were killed or displaced by the war
4473566 the fact that republicans are intervening in a democratic primary indicates their desire to avoid facing jon powers in november
4473567 i saw it was a very fast time but for us its no coincidence that they made the final and then raced so fast
4473568 getting the start today should bring in total confidence to the entire camp
4473569 in this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes
4473570 im unable to get insurance from the majority of insurers i represent
4473571 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4473572 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with
4473573 i hope you recognize that all the people who have spoken are giving a consistent message we are united together
4473574 i think inflation has peaked for certain countries like china and singapore its probably in the process of peaking for other countries like vietnam indonesia and malaysia in the coming months i think as a whole if oil prices continue to hold below us 120 barrel and inflation doesnt make a comeback then its very likely that were going to see more modest numbers by year end
4473575 we still feel that there are significant stresses in the financial markets brought about by the sub prime crisis which in turn has also caused significant stress to global economic growth and given these premises we think that earnings potentially could disappoint in the coming months
4473576 the referee didnt allow us to serve to the back of the court only the front this made it very difficult for us because we have never encountered such a situation before so we couldnt understand what was going on
4473577 in terms of real financial impact it has been limited japanese banks have a relatively small exposure to the sub prime problems in the united states if you look at the whole japanese banking sector it only amounts to about one us bank
4473578 they are likely to use that bank in the future not in the immediate to make other us acquisitions on their behalf of course banks in the us are in delicate situation at the moment especially after the housing market crisis and us banks are all a lot cheaper than they were before
4473579 it could be some good opportunities not only for mitsubishi ufj but for other japanese banks to go into that market and pick up some good solid banking franchise
4473580 especially in emerging market i see a lot of consultancy groups manufacturing groups from the states like microsoft and intel they come here and stay shipping petrochemicals they come in here they set up their business for 3 4 months before they fly back they need an apartment they need a home and thats where we see great demand for it there is a pent up demand for the service residences
4473581 i feel that a lot of the secondary cities like chengdu chongqing and dalian are looking forward to investments land prices there have not come up as high we see that as a potential
4473582 fresh produce for children at school gives them an early start on healthy eating habits that can stay with them after school and throughout their lives
4473583 this program will help educate students about the importance of good nutrition including eating fresh fruit and vegetables we know that far too many young people are struggling with being overweight and even obese now more than ever children need our help in building good eating habits so they can have a long and healthy life
4473584 im going to sit down with the coach brewster coach jason smith and my parents and talk about which schools are the best fit

4473586 weve talked about possibly having a visit with them the situation is pretty new to me
4473587 i talked with the coaching staff they really like my game i thought the campus was nice it was a beautiful campus i could see myself playing for coach fred hill and at rutgers
4473588 i hope to be an impact player at whatever school i go to
4473589 i want to come into the game and make shots and make plays

4473599 i just dont understand why my driving chipping putting isnt better
4473600 you know that recent heroes who have done super human feats like this have always seemed to end up like marion jones barry bonds what do you say to the american people who say this is so good its too good to be true
4473601 with a program like i have i have to work on speed and endurance and all four strokes
4473602 you cant do it on talent alone a lot of hard work a lot of dedication it has been a combination of everything trying to sleep as much as i can trying to recover set up every workout as well as i can and just try to bank a lot of workouts back to back

4473613 it was completely innocent and certainly not meant to cause any offense to customers however we will now consider our next steps in relation to the small number of items remaining on sale
4473614 were having a lot of phone calls about getting students home a little earlier but its not going to make it easier to get those kids home a little sooner with fewer buses on the roads fewer drivers more stops to make and the cost of fuel going up
4473615 theres pretty widespread agreement among the superintendents throughout the state that this is the worst its been in recent memory
4473616 it means it will take us longer to reduce our deficit than we originally planned
4473617 we are moving to a four day workweek which will enable us to cut out most utility costs for 20 percent of the time we are normally operational
4473618 im going to throw inside thats what i do im going to hit him and hes going to get upset

4473671 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
4473672 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
4473673 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
4473674 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
4473675 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
4473676 having this ability to really exhaustively try everything very quickly could potentially be quite helpful

4473757 vede dottore io e mio marito da qualche tempo abbiamo delle divergenze in fatto di sesso il problema in sintesi questo appena mi sveglio la mattina gli salto addosso lo bacio gli faccio qualche coccola e poi facciamo lamore
4473758 il fatto che appena lui torna a casa per il pranzo la prima cosa che faccio saltargli addosso baciarlo fargli qualche coccola e poi fare lamore
4473759 mi fa piacere scoprire che la vostra coppia funziona cos bene
4473760 la stessa cosa succede anche quando ritorna per cena e poi prima di andare a letto e a volte anche in piena notte mi sveglio gli salto addosso lo bacio gli faccio qualche coccola e poi facciamo lamore
4473761 ma complimenti davvero non mica facile trovare attivit sessuali cos intense in coppie non pi giovanissime
4473762 si ma vede dottore il guaio che appena io esco per andare al lavoro lei attende il lattaio e appena lo vede gli salta addosso lo bacia gli fa qualche coccola e poi fanno lamore
4473763 e poi la stessa cosa con il portiere il postino lelettricista e lidraulico li bacia li coccola e poi ci fa lamore

4473776 folklorists cannot provide the kind of evidence necessary to prove the existence of bigfoot or other entities whose existence is disputed to those who are not already convinced we collect investigate and analyze texts not bigfoot carcasses crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft or bottle ghosts while folklorists can discern some truths from these texts the absolute truth about the core belief is no shining pearl that we can make emerge that pearl remains obscure truth in most instances becomes a matter of faith not fact
4473777 may very well be the body of the creature commonly known as bigfoot

4473795 the perfect blend of electro pop that the industrys been waiting for master d is ready to take on the industry as a singer too
4473796 were really excited with this single its just a reflection of how groundbreaking the album will be
4473797 this year is moving much faster and were excited to take our music to a new dimension weve already painted our goals for the year and we will definitely make an impact globally
4473798 the songs on this album are very eclectic it ranges from urban pop to bollywood ballads everything is fresh to the ear
4473799 its been more of the same on the diner scene here for a long time they need help
4473800 my aim is to apply principles of fine cuisine to a diner
4473801 i am not going to take away diner staples like roast beef or broiled seafood people expect to have such comfort food at diners
4473802 i am trying to broaden the horizon for people who eat at diners
4473803 i named it sushi at a diner just to draw attention to its presence on the menu
4473804 its affordable and it allows someone down the street to come and try sushi at a diner
4473805 i had to stick to items that were ethnically from italy or brooklyn italian
4473806 theres no limits to what i can do here right now in our specials i have a caribbean mango salsa on top of pan seared grouper with citrus soy sauce
4473807 right now i am running a grilled salmon with a jersey peach and honey glaze on top of mixed greens with balsamic vinegratte
4473808 why does everything in restaurant kitchens in new jersey have to come from california or mexico or canada jersey right now has beautiful heirloom cherry and grape tomatoes peaches nectarines i am a big fan of shopping locally
4473809 i continuously ask them what can you pick for me and bring to the restaurant today
4473810 fish is a beautiful thing and using frozen fish is blasphemy to me you cant use something that has been preserved in ice and expect to create great flavors with it i get fresh fish that comes from new york markets
4473811 one of the biggest things i am going to do is to tighten up the actual menu as much as you want to have the variety as a diner sometimes it becomes meaningless
4473812 i am going to have amazing seasonal specials all year round right now its summer time lots of fish salsas and bruchettas lots of fresh citrusy things fall comes around and you will find a lot of pumpkin and squash on the menu
4473813 in the winter everything gets a little creamier a bit heavier you shouldnt have short ribs on the menu all through the year technically its a winter dish
4473814 because of my background in nutrition my food even when on the heavier side is always very clean tasting
4473815 diners are a great part of the culinary history of this state
4473816 these are places you can go to at any point of the night and day to find something that can appease you like having pancakes at 3 a m
4473817 bringing someone with fine dining and corporate backing somebody who can clean up a diner allows for the fine dining specials at the low diner prices
4473818 it improves the quality of the food in general and feeds the public better who wants to eat roast beef everyday who wouldnt want a caribbean roast beef special like i am running tonight
4473819 there was only one other person like me who was in the program because he thought it would help his culinary skills
4473820 i knew to cook since i was a child i have been doing this for about 14 15 years now i started when i was 10 years folding boxes at the naples pizzeria in campbells junction where my parents worked
4473821 city cooking and being a line chef teaches you a lot about hard work time management and cleanliness
4473822 this profession is not for the weak or the unorganized you have to be on your feet for 12 14 hours and do your job
4473823 i want to make this diner the best in central new jersey
4473824 i am looking to offer what no other diner in central jersey has which is a fine dining chef at the helm in the kitchen making fine dining specials at affordable prices

4473864 lhps executive team pioneered the joint venture shared governance model that we were looking for in moving ahead with the new medical center
4473865 we werent going to give up significant local control and we wanted the communitys physicians to be confident they could continue to deliver good medical care to their patients under the proposal from lhp both of those things are guaranteed i think the residents of bannock county are going to be very happy with the proposed relationship and the safeguards of local control built into it
4473866 if were going to ask the voters in bannock county to approve this measure in november then they deserve to know whats in that document
4473867 legacy hospital partners inc s strategy is to partner with not for profit hospitals such as portneuf medical center in the operation and ownership of community hospitals we are very honored to have been selected as the capital partner for portneuf our team has been impressed by the community and its commitment of time and energy to find the right partner for the hospitals future i want to thank the community leaders elected officials physicians hospital employees educators and others who have invested so much in this process we look forward to working with you in developing a regional medical center that is second to none
4473868 this governance model absolutely guarantees that local influence over our hospital will continue
4473869 ive had people ask me why a capital partner that owns the majority of a new medical center would give us 50 percent control if you think about it its very smart on their part whos going to know better what services our local hospital should deliver than our local residents and our physicians if were meeting the needs of the region the hospital will grow and thrive and that makes lhps investment worth more
4473870 what the voters decide in november will shape health care in our region for decades to come
4473871 we can go forward or we can fall backward its our job between now and november to answer every question and satisfy the residents of bannock county that this represents a tremendous opportunity for all of us

4473907 were pretty fortunate to get a person of his stature to make an appearance
4473908 when the experts were asked to look at it they said no we cant recommend award
4473909 that whole bid letting was just very suspect to me
4473910 never done anything contrary to the recommendation of the awards committee
4473911 obviously we just finished a walk through but from a playing time stand point the ones will get the first half on both sides of the ball and the twos and threes will mix up the rest there will be some twos to mix in obviously because of any injury theyll be some twos playing prior to that that will play with the ones but other than that theyll be some ones that dont finish the first half isaac bruce for example someone like that or even frank gore may not finish the half and some other players possibly but well see how the reps go in that respect and in respect to the quarterback position were going to maintain the same rotation that we did last week and well let the number of plays that the quarter second quarter and the half to dictate when we make a switch
4473912 i dont know at this point like i said were kind of like last week well let the game dictate that if we get enough work prior to the end of the first half then we may make a switch prior to the first half ending
4473913 i dont have an idea although scot mccloughan had mentioned it today he had talked with ted thompson they were kind of kidding about whos playing what but i dont have an idea at this time no
4473914 they will be there in the third quarter yes theres not a lot of thirds as you all know theres not a lot of those guys so the group that sometimes you see at the beginning of the second half if its twos sometimes theyve got to run it to the end of the game because its just not the numbers
4473915 well its another opportunity to showcase what he can do as it is for everyone else
4473916 at no time did i say that we would have one guy for one game to the next we would not discuss the specifics because i didnt know what they were going to be we did have a plan for practice and as practice goes through you kind of adjust that because thats an evaluation process but were continually doing the same thing decisions are made and obviously were talking about what gives us the best opportunity to win i am still encouraged by all three quarterbacks its just very difficult to say whats fair and fair to the team the things that were trying to do right now are trying to get ourselves in position to win obviously so that the entire football team is affected by what we do but i am encouraged by all three guys i feel good about that i feel a lot better than i ever have since ive been here at any time
4473917 all of the quarterbacks like ive said in the beginning i want to see the efficiency of the offense again in all of them
4473918 right now we are just in an evaluation process we are utilizing this time in the preseason practice and in the games to evaluate our people
4473919 you know guys i think it is unfair to even comment on that issue with how it relates to what we are doing because thats a personal issue we went through that last year and i know alex is having a difficult time and id rather leave it at that than tie it into what we are doing because i dont think thats fair
4473920 he wont play a half wed like to get a series with him but to be honest with you i dont need a series with him but were down in numbers so hell get some because we only have about five or six healthy wide receivers we are going to have to do something there just to utilize a little bit and it doesnt hurt its good for him to get time in with the players no question and we are trying to get some continuity and some consistency in what we are doing but i dont believe hell finish the half
4473921 well you know what im going to let aaron salkin announce the names so i dont sputter on them because id have to take a few minutes here to think about it but there are some guys that are out for the game obviously michael robinson and then david baas rather than leave somebody out id think youd get an accurate deal after
4473922 well hes going to be a one in the game in the preseason game but again we are still in the process of determining things if a guy is not on the field its hard for him to compete for the job
4473923 he will probably finish the half i would hope that he doesnt have to go in the second half thats the plan going in if it changes it would change at halftime
4473924 other than watching this little bit that i see here i didnt pay close attention to any of the things that were going on in this last month or so with brett favre and that whole situation so i really dont have a lot of experience watching it is kind of difficult for me to comment on the play of another team other than a little bit of film and getting ready to play it looks to me like hes got a pretty good feel for the offense its been mike mccarthys hes got two years now in that same attack and he looks like hes doing a good job the other day he came out with some decent numbers but outside of that its hard for me to say much about it
4473925 that first unit taking that first half i would hope that was exactly what happens but well see again without putting a number of reps on it we want to finish that half depending on how those guys do well muster it up from there
4473926 we are best friends to me thats a joy its not only a joy to enjoy life but to enjoy it with someone you love having her in my corner will always be my motivation
4473927 its about life and that you only have one chance to take advantages of opportunities because you dont know when they are coming while youre here you have to take advantage of every opportunity that you have because when its over its over what are you saving it for
4473928 as a rookie i thought this is whats supposed to happen to us and its going to be like that every year when we didnt go back to the super bowl the second year we finally realized it takes a lot of work its tough to get there
4473929 with those guys around me it made me better the way that it did was that they took me to the side and said this is how you do this having the veterans around me i think that helped plateau my career
4473930 it was pressure but i took everything in stride and i knew my ability i knew i was in the room with a bunch of hall of fame guys so knowing that i didnt get caught up in the awe of it i used what they had to benefit me
4473931 to reach that plateau in my career it was amazing
4473932 i was on the outside looking in on what was going on my job was to keep outside containment suddenly gary plummer goes over the top of the pile to hit the running back the ball drops i saw it and reacted
4473933 jim kelly tried to bring me down but that didnt work i took off and started running that play never gets lost in my mind
4473934 every player they will go through the struggle of getting back into normal life
4473935 when football becomes your life for eight years its hard to remove yourself from it because its all that you know
4473936 watching the 49ers practice you get that feeling like you want to be back out there
4473937 of course you understand your age and think do i really want to go through those sore days again but being able to watch practice as an outsider i think is a good thing i can just remember my days and be grateful for them
4473938 whatever happened on the field we got into a little scrap but we went back to work
4473939 we were just trying to give our offense a good look for green bay and when we get back into the locker room were going to hug matter of fact im going to hug vernon right now
4473940 i was blocking hard and i got him pushed back and he shoved me afterwards and i shoved him it ends there for me im not going to swing on anybody unless they swing on me i know we dont need that we dont need to be hurting each other
4473941 any time im involved in the offense like that i like it

4473959 the approach hes taken is one that is political he expects there to be no change in the outcome this is only to draw attention to himself and his re election efforts it begs the question whether the congressman is as concerned about the 15 and 16 year old girls at western hills high school as he is about his election i think its a question voters should be asking
4473960 the first pan asia web technology event bringing together executives entrepreneurs and venture capitalists from throughout asia
4473961 we are just enjoying being engaged and being with each other
4473962 we feel that when the time is right we will know it
4473963 a business opportunity for us at the time had a requirement for outbound dialling and email
4473964 we considered some hosted service offerings from other vendors to do that alongside smaller telephony products from companies that could provide outbound campaigns but we know how reliable and trustworthy nortel is and that it does what it says it will which ultimately is what matters
4473965 the return on investment comes from the deal that was won on the back of the upgrade we have not done the metrics properly yet but we are much better off in terms of ease of use and staff management
4473966 part of our business is an online tours reservation engine when we have bedded down the email handling and outbound dialling we will look at the web collaboration part of the package
4473967 we have additional agents kept for contingency planning and the platform can scale up to 400 people
4473968 we looked at collaboration technologies to support home working previously and we are capable of doing it but have chosen not to do it so far it may become more attractive in terms of cost efficiency as fuel and transport bills rise

4473976 even his own shadow cabinet knows that david cameron is all about slick pr and not substance
4473977 michael goves boasts about how david cameron is good at pr and that his image is important just show how much his boss puts shallow salesmanship ahead of leadership
4473978 but as michael gove today admits david cameron has simply put a new gloss on a completely unreformed conservative party
4473979 star centre forward imported to an otherwise unreformed and grumpy team
4473980 our volunteers have been so involved from the organizational end of things they really havent had time to digest the fact that the tournament is only days away
4473981 they had lots of enthusiasm when they initially started and theyve certainly put the work in the excitement level as the event approaches is tempered somewhat by the work involved but lately weve been getting more people stepping up to the plate trying to help out
4473982 at this point its mostly down to the nitty gritty stuff
4473983 just making sure we have all the scorers and officials in place the facilities programs hospitality all the so called major stuff has been taken care of
4473984 its been an eye opener and certainly had its moments
4473985 i knew there would be a lot of work and i accepted it this is not the first time ive run a big event like this but its the first event of this kind its been interesting and ive learned a lot now its almost time for the all the good people weve had working for us to sit back relax and reap the rewards of their labour
4473986 as i said before everything seems to be falling into place and were putting the final touches on things just making sure all areas have been taking care of
4473987 we started in 1969 and by 1977 we had won a national championship
4473988 when can eight year olds get a chance to rub elbows with the likes of karen furneaux we are very unique in that regard
4473989 our goal is to achieve success at all levels we have athletes that have made those elite teams but we are also focused on long term athletic development in the early years it has to be fun obviously not all of our athletes will reach the olympics but they all have a chance
4473990 its time for city hall to make a commitment to halifaxs intellectual capital by approving plans for a new spring garden road library

4474000 well have a very good august as far as expenditures go
4474001 in yet another indication that barack obamas financial advantage may not prove to be all that formidable the mccain campaign has just announced a solid fundraising month for july campaign manager rick davis said on a conference call with reporters just now that they took in 27 million compared to 22 million in june
4474002 to come out and ride a personal best is what the olympics are all about the world record is on the cards
4474003 if i win three gold medals at the end of the week ill do a dance for you i promise

4474011 this is what its all about the past present and future of nodaway county
4474012 i think if people come in and see this work theyll appreciate it so much more
4474013 ive been to them all over the world i cant even count the number of museums ive been in we are lucky to have this one here in nodaway county
4474014 its a good place to live i love it here
4474015 were going to be real conservative this year with the budget
4474016 and watch expenditures real closely and try to hold some expenses down from previous years
4474017 theyve been going down but how long is that going to last
4474018 at some point we have to be prepared for when they go back up
4474019 we really dont have a lot of schools close to us that play baseball
4474020 so once again transportation is going to be a big issue
4474021 through the efforts of many regular blood donors we have been able to meet the daily needs of patients in area hospitals
4474022 but we have been unable to replenish our inventory to the level that will assure future needs are met we need all types but we have a critical need for type o positive blood
4474023 in addition to the expertise of our senior partners experience on demand provides a team of 24 associate partners specializing in key aspects of management and professional business services
4474024 our firms business model is rooted in research conducted at the university of missouri st louis college of business administration which reveals there is a talent gap at many organizations between entry level managers and experienced executives leaving their jobs resulting in a vacuum of capable management expertise
4474025 we established experience on demand to fill those professional gaps on an interim basis at small and large companies anticipating change or dealing with new challenges but which lack the crucial executive talent to address the specific issues that they confront
4474026 experience on demand is a unique management consulting consortium our senior partners and associates provide dedicated high level professional skills and proven expertise on a part time basis to help organizations manage special projects address workload peaks plan for strategic change and apply objective business management insight on an as needed basis
4474027 each organization we serve seeks professional expertise on a focused transitional basis to help the organization address challenging internal or external goals in each case one or more of our partners may be on assignment for several days or several weeks per month until the project goals are met
4474028 we are very optimistic about experience on demand because this consulting consortium was established during a period of transition in the u
4474029 many employers today see the need to engage senior level talent on a per project basis rather than hiring executive managers full time to deal with business issues they confront
4474030 experience on demands value proposition is that we provide seasoned management and professional skills in many business disciplines and apply those resources to strategically help client organizations in cost effective ways
4474031 after one can it seemed to turn the young individual into one with more of the type of profile you would expect to see with someone with cardiovascular disease
4474032 people who already have existing cardiovascular disease may want to talk to their physician before they drink red bull in future
4474033 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4474034 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4474035 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4474036 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4474037 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4474038 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4474039 could not and did not protect larry from the threats and ultimate death
4474040 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4474041 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4474042 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4474043 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4474044 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4474045 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4474046 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4474047 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4474048 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4474049 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4474050 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4474051 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4474052 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4474053 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4474054 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4474055 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4474056 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4474057 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4474058 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
4474059 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4474060 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4474061 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4474062 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4474063 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries
4474064 a lot of the troops here are on the fence or disappointed
4474065 whatever is the courts judgment some of them would not be satisfied it is not far fetched that such dissatisfaction would further impinge on the fluid security situation in mindanao
4474066 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again
4474067 being alive after all the troubles just makes me thankful despite the difficulties
4474068 give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore send these the homeless tempest tost to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door
4474069 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory
4474070 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
4474071 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
4474072 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
4474073 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
4474074 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
4474075 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
4474076 then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life
4474077 the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war no matter how justified shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of early wars were treated and appreciated by our nation
4474078 change is something god intends his people to experience together
4474079 let him who cannot be alone beware of community let him who is not in community beware of being alone
4474080 parents shopping for back to school gear could be forgiven for walking into a store nowadays and thinking they have gone through a time warp
4474081 with 1930s prices for pens glue notebooks and even t shirts the season seems more
4474082 for purposes of time comments may be limited to two minutes
4474083 but honey i never visit those sites they must have uhhhmmmm stolen my email address from a republican mailing list
4474084 some sad incidents happened at a time when we had a boom in the tourism industry it is as if the sun had set at noon
4474085 my effort will be bring the leaders of the agitation to the table so that all the problems are resolved
4474086 even in their absence the court believes it has authority to proceed with the case
4474087 in the past we thought if a marine had post traumatic stress disorder he was gone now its more like breaking a leg
4474088 the life and times of the woman who brought down a cabinet minister will be chronicled in an autobiography due out in the fall
4474089 all i can remember is going up i went up and i came down and i hit something very very hard
4474090 a soldier told me i hit the footpath but as far as i was concerned i thought i hit a telegraph pole cause all i could see was sparks and the smell of rubber
4474091 i looked down and i could see annes skirt and i thought oh poor annes been injured too
4474092 i thought wheres the rest of the girls and they werent i couldnt see anybody
4474093 i think the intelligence services have not fully cooperated with the investigation
4474094 my father said and i do believe his words theres a time for you to be born into this world and a time for you to be taken out of it
4474095 thats quite true cause its been proved cause all those people round me were all taken and i was saved but in saying that it was a hard fight a very hard fight
4474096 real madrid president ramon calderon was very polite with us
4474097 i told him that we had an offer of 32million euros from chelsea and that robinho wanted to leave the club
4474098 he said he didnt want to hear that a player was unhappy with the team but at the end nothing much was going to happen
4474099 calderon said that he wouldnt sell robinho even for 100million he was very emphatic
4474100 i left the meeting thinking that was that but then i spoke to other directors of the club and saw that this position could end up changing
4474101 if they do not release him robinho will continue sad and in the year that comes he could leave for a sum that is much less than chelseas current offer
4474102 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4474103 i am really starting to wonder more and more where he is now the nights are colder and colder his family must be aching in their hearts i do not know how i would be if i lost my child i cannot imagine it please come home little yadav
4474104 my heart goes out to his parents and i pray for his safe return
4474105 its something weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4474106 it shouldnt be on the short list let alone win
4474107 i maintain my innocence and id like to know why i was excluded because the chief commissioner has not given me a reason
4474108 its not about the money at all and anybody who knows me will testify to that
4474109 if theyd just said thank you to me 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 then that wouldve been the end of it
4474110 but theyve never even bought me a cup of coffee
4474111 for years people have thought i was earning a lot of money from the show but i havent received a single cent since my last pay cheque from fauna about 200 in 1968 when i saw the latest boxed set of dvds i thought ive had enough
4474112 when i signed on for the first season of skippy i was a young and probably naive actor and i was given a verbal agreement that if the show was successful after the first season then wed talk about a few more bikkies in the bikkie tin
4474113 i believe george has severe anger management issues georges anger is constant and persistent
4474114 he is unable to control his anger in front of the children george would criticise and pick fights with pam or the nannies
4474115 george faulted me with the incident and yelled at me that i was useless in front of son georgie
4474116 when i asked george if he was serious in blaming me for such an incident he fired me on the spot and sent me to my room to pack my belongings while he stood over me in an intimidating way
4474117 george then realised that since pam was away and he was incapable of handling the three children on his own that he needed me to stay
4474118 i agreed to stay because i was concerned for the kids and i had promised pam i would take good care of the kids in her absence
4474119 it was a very scary incident pam terminated our trip early because of georges drinking and angry rages
4474120 it was so much fun because the public were here you could feel the energy
4474121 i would never recommend any woman to have her baby delivered in a private hospital
4474122 doctors have a general duty to inform their patients of the risks so they can make informed choices
4474123 we thought we were paying for the best of care
4474124 this has occurred in all areas of the city but is a particular issue in the old county road and villa avenue areas where auto repair shops are operated

4474133 it is kind of surreal it is a feeling that leaves me elated the one thing while doing khatron ke khiladi was that the journey should be fantastic and it has been just that
4474134 for me winning was great am not saying no to that but the journey of reaching the finals was worth everything it is actually worth more than winning winning was just like the cherry on the pudding it was a thrilling experience
4474135 the new york boot camp is always worth the cross country trip

4474143 we love our peg channels we understand and respect the value they deliver and were willing to pay to improve their ability to serve our community so stop dicking around and start delivering us the service we know our community deserves
4474144 a few days ago french president nicolas sarkozy got agreement on the six points from the russians and then from the georgians
4474145 and there was agreement on these points as a set of principles it now needs to be a formal ceasefire and thats what were working on
4474146 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off

4474150 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4474151 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4474152 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4474153 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4474154 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4474155 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4474156 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4474160 i dont care about this medal i wanted gold this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4474161 the olympics isnt just about who can run the fastest or whatever it is also about sportsmanship
4474162 we transported a total of 103 pieces of equipment from kaiserslautern here to bulgaria to support the jtf east mission
4474163 so far my short experience with the bulgarian soldiers has been very productive and very positive
4474164 i think they are very eager to receive this training in support of the global war on terror
4474165 the soldiers from my battalion have done a tremendous job as far as getting these vehicles trucked both at a battalion level and a garrison level
4474166 it is really a big muscle move to push these vehicles out of germany to bulgaria
4474167 this has all been in conjunction with an overall battalion move from one location in germany to the next all while training for this actual mission and putting together this whole logistics plan i have to say the soldiers have done a terrific job and have worked very hard to make this mission a success
4474168 for the most part we have a uav on station for the majority of missions that involve the capture of high value targets or terrorists
4474169 the aircraft is an active contributor to the actual apprehension of these criminals
4474170 its hard to imagine combat today without uavs the aircrafts capabilities are continuously improving and they are beginning to do a lot of the same missions as our manned aircraft
4474171 our guys fly them out hand them off to the brigade combat teams in theatre and at that time the specific brigade tuav elements actually fly the missions
4474172 at the conclusion of a shadow mission the brigades route the aircraft back into our airspace and the uav operators here pick the aircraft back up and land them once they land we conduct maintenance and prep them for another mission
4474173 everything we do in terms of maintaining the aircraft is annotated by inputting information into our computer system we keep track of just about anything you can think from actual flight hours to required services and inspections
4474174 the uavs can provide at least 70 percent of the support you would get from an attack helicopter minus the armament
4474175 the operators can observe perform route reconnaissance and report immediately over voice what they see to the ground forces very similar to conventional aerial reconnaissance methods its very helpful
4474176 the shadow provides coverage for a lot of raids we do road scans for roadside bombs and have actually caught terrorists in the act of implanting these bombs in the road the uav mission is imperative to todays combat operations
4474177 when the infantry troops are going into a certain area to clear buildings well go in ahead of time and scan the area and well be able to report to them exact grids of potential enemies in the area
4474178 james blake is clearly upset with the umpire after a call went against him in the closing stages of his epic defeat against fernando gonzalez in the mens semi finals
4474179 today i was supposed to be getting a medal for my grandfather
4474180 i guarantee if he was still alive i would call him and tell him what happened today and he would probably say well i won my bowling tournament whether he did it or not
4474181 i think about that he wanted me to know one of us was winning so i still owe him
4474182 i just came out and tried to work a few things and it worked out
4474183 hes gotten a whole lot better i think even bigger and stronger his wrist is like the size of vcr tapes
4474184 its his home country a lot of honor is in your heart when youre wrestling in front of your people you want to give them a medal because sometimes there are people out there who deserve it more than you my hats off to him thats a tough loss for him and his home crowd he brought it he was really trying hard i was just able to hold him off
4474185 he came out real fast so i was ready for it
4474186 i got out there and saw that he was feeling it just as much as i was and my offense wasnt working for me in the end like when i really needed to i tried to hit that gut wrench as many times as i could and it didnt pan out
4474187 thats my go to move and it wasnt there for me my lift i wasnt able to get off on him hindsight is always 20 20 looking back i know for a fact i should have been doing a whole lot more on my feet
4474188 i already know coach army staff sgt shon lewis is going to say that right off the top i missed a couple of key opportunities to score on my feet and ill never get em back and this is not the place where you should walk around saying anything like that
4474189 in competitions like this youre looking to see your soul out there gasping on the mat for air and it didnt happen today
4474190 i walked off i wasnt tired i was like man if im not tired then i didnt do everything i shouldve done
4474191 usually we say you get back to the hotel room and your mirror will be the most honest thing youll ever see i dont even have to make it that far to know i dropped the ball today and i apologize to anybody i let down theres more fight in me theres a whole lot more fight in me and im going to have to make sure thats shown the next competitions the next major ones the next olympics
4474192 if these rules were something that started last week i would probably have a whole lot to say about it but ive won some matches the same way
4474193 its something we know its an occupational hazard i guess but we accept it the way it is
4474194 greco roman wrestling regardless of the rules and what changes they make when it boils down its wrestling
4474195 and if you dont go out there and wrestle head down no anthem no flag thats the way it is
4474196 theres something in us that makes us keep going it might be just drive determination american spirit me and my background soldiering i dont know but theres just something in here that says its never time to quit weve got something we can accomplish here so were going to hit it hard these next four years and do everything we have to do
4474197 honestly its a lot smaller tournament than what i thought
4474198 and i couldve brought a whole lot bigger fight im kicking myself for that
4474199 i think there was times when i was holding back i always joke that i can outrun anybody on a treadmill i dont have to think when im on a treadmill but if im outside running i forget what im doing but on the treadmill im a heavyweight king running a marathon sometimes it happens in wrestling ill be out there and my mind will wander
4474200 people are very friendly architecture is amazing the great wall experience was awesome
4474201 you cant put a cap on the fight in an americans heart
4474202 were just craving another chance now this is just fuel for something bigger and the only thing bigger is the next olympics
4474203 if we make a difference in one soldiers life and possibly that of his or her children we have been successful but to impact so many soldiers and families is simply overwhelming and fills the heart with pride
4474204 this program has grown so large for us that nearly everyone feels the positive influence of this family interaction
4474205 i cannot be more proud of our ministry team and the positive impact they have had on our daily mission
4474206 its a wonderful blessing to be able read to my daughter on video receive a video in return and be able to watch her sit and follow along with the book
4474207 it helps with the separation and i get to help teach her to read at the same time
4474208 many soldiers do not have the time to come to our reading room so we take our video camera and books to them
4474209 the main idea for this program is simply to keep soldiers in touch with their families the greatest reward however is the knowledge that someone back home will cry smile or laugh as they see their loved one in living color live before them on tv

4474214 wat moet ik zeggen we gingen gewoon niet hard genoeg
4474215 we kwamen pure snelheid tekort dat is een vervelende conclusie
4474216 ik voelde dat ik met een lagere snelheid mijn eigen ronde inging theos rondje was niet zo hard als normaal

4474223 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4474224 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4474225 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4474226 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4474227 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4474228 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4474229 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4474230 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4474231 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach

4474245 women certainly do seek out opportunities to assist other women
4474246 so many of the issues and problems are the same the bond of being a woman business owner supersedes the cultural differences
4474247 the pastor as spiritual leader is emerging as a much more dynamic and effective pastoral role than those of pastor as caregiver teacher and preacher not the pastor as spiritual authority but as spiritual leader guide or mentor
4474248 the public reading of scripture to preaching and to teaching
4474249 it would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of god to wait on tables we will give our attention to the prayer worship and the ministry of the word

4474251 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4474268 the expo aims at promoting young up coming entrepreneurs and thereby encouraging young people to get involved in the creation of employment for themselves and others
4474269 it encourages young people to take charge of their lives and to get into the main line of economic development and decision making processes
4474270 enterprise has the potential to alleviate poverty through providing alternative livelihoods to the vast majority of our people further enterprise is the engine that will continue to drive job creation economic growth and prosperity
4474271 most important challenges are access to finance and banking products suited to the youth market very often it is mistakenly taken that young people are unwilling to submit themselves to the demands of the banking industry

4474276 farmers both active and retired should be aware of changes in the most recent farm bill concerning land in the conservation reserve program
4474277 i and many of my colleagues took exception to that irs notice the 2008 farm bill did not follow that guideline and effective december 2007 taxpayers who are retired or disabled will not be subject to taxes on crp payments
4474278 as part of the crp contract farmers are required to maintain the land whether planting grass or other things by virtue of them working on the land the irs apparently didnt consider these folks to be retired
4474279 more importantly for young families the farmer had to be covered for the most current quarters for disability
4474280 farming is a hazardous industry and until this change in the 2008 farm bill the quarters of coverage was translated to 400 per quarter or 1 600 per year over the past 6 8 years inflation adjusters were added on and the 1 600 per year only bought one quarter of coverage since the law required two consecutive quarters the old guidelines 400 per quarter had no value
4474281 growers need to be aware there are some options under form se
4474282 for easy math lets say the value is 1 000 per quarter the farmer will be required to pay 15 3 percent tax on the four quarters of value or 4 000 it is more money up front but it does provide them with disability benefits
4474283 a family should really think about taking this deduction because it basically takes away any development rights for the farmland the new law takes away development rights on the land for perpetuity or forever plus two days
4474284 this has been a year where it is all about rainfall
4474285 it is still a little too early to make any predictions the next six weeks rain wise will make or break the crop
4474286 in some parts of the state peanuts look tremendous but we do have some that are very dry
4474287 we dont have any that are devastated beyond hope that i am aware of
4474288 but we are a long way from bringing this crop home there is so much that could go bad or good
4474289 any time you have the dry weather weve had it affects the corn
4474290 last year we had enough rain early in the season but the eastern and southwestern parts of the state are extremely dry this year
4474291 for the most part we are beginning the harvest of a normal season
4474292 my most memorable experience was walking out onto the field for my first game in new delhi
4474293 i can remember everything but at the same time everything was such a blur the only way to describe it was a complete sensory overload from the seas of screaming fans the smell of the field and the surprisingly warm night heat to the pulsing beat of the royal challengers theme song echoing through the stadium while cheering in indias capital
4474294 they were so beautiful and the dance style was so intricate classic and beautiful
4474295 mother rings hold gem stones of her children only for your mom it would be you and your brothers birth stone
4474296 so i need four stones your are december and we need my sister in law whats her birth month
4474297 no not me your mom will only need your birth stone and your brothers
4474298 oh well your moms ring is going to be expensive because april is a diamond your moms birthday is in april right
4474299 no my mothers mother ring doesnt have her birth month in it just mine and my brothers
4474300 i don t see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4474301 but a superhuman effort by 30 strangers who lifted the vehicle off her body miraculously saved her baby before she died
4474302 a gun bust and arrests for driving on a suspended license grand larceny menacing and aggravated harassment
4474303 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and we are forever grateful
4474304 it is a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4474305 yeah we all have our not so hot stories the curse

4474312 i wonder what russia would have thought of another country marching over its borders to interfere
4474313 perhaps mr saakashvili was a little reckless in seeking to stamp out the separatist guerrillas
4474314 georgia did not invade its neighbours georgia did not torture and murder hundreds of thousands of its own citizens
4474315 the same eu that is always eager to pump itself up at the expense of democratic institutions
4474316 unrealistic force plans overoptimistic cost estimates unrealistic projections of technical feasibility and inadequate program management have created an unaffordable ship building program led the navy to phase out capable ships for new ships it cannot fund and threaten the us navys ability to implement an effective maritime strategy
4474317 the problem starts at a conceptual disconnect between strategy and reality the navys cooperative strategy for 21st century seapower is a set of concepts that was not linked to any clearly defined force plan modernization plan program or budget navy shipbuilding plans are now shaped more as the result of budgetary constraints than as a response to strategic requirements they seem to be an expression of wishful thinking rather than a realistic strategic guideline for naval procurement
4474318 the navys procurement policy is in serious disarray and is creating situation where the most serious threat to the us navy is now the us navy
4474319 the congressional budget office estimates that the execution of the navys current 30 year shipbuilding plan would cost an average 25 billion per year 30 percent above navy estimates cost overruns such as estimated 1 billion for the cvn 78 aircraft carrier jeopardize the entire program overoptimistic cost estimates have led navy officials to shift funding to the outyears this will cause a temporary shortfall of carriers and a breach of us law
4474320 is a case study in failed leadership on the part of the most senior officers and civilians in the navy

4474331 net property taxes in wisconsin rose 5 7 percent in 2008 the largest increase since 2005 the year before the recent levy limits on municipalities and counties were imposed the new study notes that 2006 property taxes here were ninth highest nationally and higher than those in all surrounding states
4474332 from 1977 to the present south dakotas tax burden ranking has dropped 25 places from 20th highest to 45th primarily by maintaining a zero rate on individual and corporate income the tax burden ranking in arizona has dropped 24 places from 17th highest to 41st and the residents there now pay the tenth lowest tax burden most of the change came in the wake of a property tax limitation in 1980 and their ranking has changed little since montana has dropped 22 places primarily by maintaining a zero rate on general sales colorado has dropped 19 places in the ranking over the last 30 years it levies every major tax but the rate on each is among the lowest in the country spending discipline in the form of a so called tabor taxpayer bill of rights has helped the state keep tax rates low two politically liberal states have dropped sharply oregon and massachusetts oregon has done so by never enacting a sales tax dropping 16 ranks from 10th highest to 26th massachusetts has dropped 17 places by imposing a property tax limitation and keeping a lid on its personal income tax rate living down its taxachusetts nickname
4474333 wisconsin falls from ranks of top 10 highest taxed states for first time since 1980
4474334 wisconsins taxes actually rose slightly in the fiscal year ended in june 2006 but those of other states rose more quickly

4474338 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4474352 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4474353 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4474354 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population

4474367 there is no chance at current rates for a competitor to steal craigs listings and readers by charging less
4474368 the achievement gap is the greatest civil rights issue facing our country today
4474369 when you have a healthy middle class it really does change the dynamic of schools and housing
4474370 i recognize there is still a huge achievement gap but i dont want to lose the idea that our kids are gaining
4474371 some are gaining at a faster rate that is what is widening our gap
4474372 it gives me hope when we find out there are some places in spite of difficult situations that are doing well
4474373 all of this work is going to be around the achievement gap
4474374 they are focused like a laser beam on making sure all kids get a quality education all kids get what they need out of schools

4474509 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4474510 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4474511 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4474512 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4474513 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4474514 all of us must try to resolve the problem of slow service delivery with the new processing centers payments now take less than four weeks
4474515 im glad that the centre is right here and that i will now be able to lodge my claim

4474526 this sector has conducted a series of roadshows and awareness campaigns in october 2007 covering all six regions of the province
4474527 during the campaigns union leaders and members encouraged citizens in shopping malls taxi ranks and other public areas to support the campaign

4474531 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4474532 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4474533 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4474534 it will be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo ante
4474535 any measures that they are allowed to take have got to be of a very limited nature for a very limited period of time

4474547 we therefore need to invest in womens education and therefore their ability to enter the labour market and be economically empowered is the greatest investment any family community and country can make
4474548 these are elements that give women a fighting chance including education and micro credit
4474549 some of these sectors that our countries under invest in and that are critical for women include agriculture
4474550 this conference will therefore play an important role in pointing us in the right direction

4474590 senator edwards knew nothing about the relationship between these former co workers which began when they worked together in 2006
4474591 i cant think that there is another possible explanation knowing the way i know rielle
4474592 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
4474593 all you left wing bloggers who want to smear mr corsi
4474594 theres over 300 pages 700 footnotes and ill stand by the truth of every statement in this book
4474595 a large number of e mails were received from readers objecting that obama was not the messiah but rather the biblical antichrist prefigured in saint johns apocalypse
4474596 i had to read it about six times before i began to figure it out
4474597 why obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
4474598 what is obama trying to hide and why would he do so
4474599 that obamas father was a polygamist and an alcoholic may or may not tell us much about obama
4474600 interestingly obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack senior or to his indonesian stepfather missing from the dedication are the grandparents who raised him in hawaii
4474601 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book
4474602 in the introduction that he wrote after this was going with the second book and the original book had no dedication page and this is not the typical way that you dedicate a book so im making the distinction there is no dedication page in the book at all never has been
4474603 never states precisely how many wives his father had or how many half brothers and sisters he has from different mothers
4474604 sayid obama was not even sure how many wives his brother had
4474605 obama blames racism for breaking up his parents marriage not his fathers polygamist ways
4474606 obama is again lying about history to claim jfk had anything to do with bringing his father to the united states to study
4474607 obama senior following the prescripts of islamic sharia law divorced
4474608 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond
4474609 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to africa on the 1992 trip
4474610 after our engagement i took michelle to kenya to meet the other half of my family
4474611 what would be heard by most listeners is that obama hates the military so much that he might leave the united states defenseless against our enemies
4474612 i did not see my brother practice islam especially after he came back from his studies in the united states
4474613 there is no doubt obama senior was a muslim by birth and upbringing
4474614 obama did attend a government run public school in indonesia and he did receive islamic instruction including study of the koran
4474615 barack obama is not and never has been a muslim
4474616 that physical description does not match the indonesia television news videos showing the house
4474617 it is hard to decipher what obama might be trying to hide by not being clear about the specific location of the houses where he lived in jakarta
4474618 the black man who tried to peel off his skin
4474619 advertisements in the negro magazines still hymn nadinola skin bleach lightens and brightens skin
4474620 the entire episode suggests what psychologists call hypothetical lying in other words imagining something that has not happened but imagining it with so much precise detail that the made up memory functions for the person as if it were real
4474621 has obama lost the ability to tell the difference between something that actually happened and something he invented
4474622 after the date obama wants us to think he left indonesia
4474623 the puzzle just adds to the growing list of factual discrepancies or outright fabrications that obama manufactures very likely on an ongoing basis
4474624 if we cant trust you to remember which magazine you read in indonesia when you were 9 how can we possibly ever trust you to protect our country
4474625 asked me to run as its presidential candidate in 2008
4474626 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4474627 didnt john kerry begin practicing judiasm he also has paternal grandparents that were jewish what religion is john kerry
4474628 obamas mother chose another third world prospect for her second husband
4474629 the race obama embraces is not that of his mother although he does have that choice
4474630 obama wants to will all the white blood out of himself so he can become pure black
4474631 if obama does win the presidency in 2008 he will be the first president in our history to have an extended family in another country
4474632 we cant yet get the authentic birth certificate im convinced its a forgery
4474633 if a birth certificate were forged and put on a website its conceivable that somebody committed a felony
4474634 president bush intends to abrogate u s sovereignty to the north american union a new economic and political entity which the president is quietly forming why doesnt president bush just tell the truth his secret agenda is to dissolve the united states of america into the north american union
4474635 nobody has worked harder to convince people that the completely moronic north american conspiracy theory is real
4474636 many of the black rage paragraphs obama wrote in dreams from my father bear a striking resemblance to passages frantz fanon wrote in his first book black skin white masks
4474637 ray assured me that we would never talk about whites without knowing exactly what we were doing without knowing that there might be a price to pay
4474638 for several years certain laboratories have been trying to produce a serum for denegrification
4474639 frantz fanons revolutionary writings were instrumental in shaping obamas own political analysis of race
4474640 we do not know if obama senior ever shared fanons writings with his son but much of the expression of black resentment obama offers in dreams from my father appears strongly influenced by fanons pages
4474641 obama railed against the same forms of racial oppression his father must have felt under british colonialism
4474642 the use of change as a political slogan dates back to socialist saul alinsky and his desire to cause a radical redistribution of income from the haves to the have nots in america
4474643 obama has borrowed phrases freely even from movies taking bamboozled from spike lees movie about malcolm x and the phrase he is the one from the matrix movie series
4474644 is a plagiarist plain and simple he cannot be trusted
4474645 likes to present himself as the distinguished professor of education at the university of illinois at chicago
4474646 could easily block obama from the white house and not just in 2008 but forever
4474647 in his eleven year reign of underground terror ayers participated in thirty bombings
4474648 palmer would never have introduced obama to the hyde park political community at the ayres dohrn home unless she saw an affinity between ayers and dohrns radical leftist history her own history of far leftist politics and the politics of barack obama
4474649 either he did not know ayers and dohrn are still radical leftists in which case he is implausibly naive or obama did know which would confirm he joined with ayers and dohrn because obama too continues to believe albeit silently and secretly in the far lefts radical agenda
4474650 even today ayers appears to hold the same radical political beliefs he did in the weather underground and obama had to know that was also the case when he first met ayers in 1995
4474651 mccarthy era committees seeking to expose communists considered to be a security threat
4474652 when obama tells audiences that his community organizing experience taught me a lot about listening to people as opposed to coming with a premeditated agenda he is reciting pure alinsky dogma
4474653 conservative columnist ann coulter has characterized obamas dreams from my father as a dimestore mein kampf
4474654 obama engages in what appears to be animated conversation with the professor
4474655 bookcase in the quincy house dorm included titles by karl marx and howard zinn
4474656 the socialist viewpoint is a magazine published by the socialist workers organization a group that describes itself as formed to advance the revolutionary marxist political program in the united states
4474657 little green footballs has called graham felsen a hardcore marxist
4474658 exactly what is a democratic candidate doing with a staffer who acts as the campaigns publics face when the staffer is featured in marxist publications
4474659 how possibly can obama argue his association with radicals such as bill ayers and bernardine dohrn was a long time ago when he continues to recruit a marxist sympathizer such as sam graham felsen to be an official blogger of his 2008 presidential campaign
4474660 reverend wright adapted the phrase to imply that the terrorist attacks of 9 11 were divine retribution for white americas continuing racial injustice
4474661 how could obama know these were the subjects of wrights sermons unless he had heard them
4474662 before obamas baptism at trinity when he was nearly thirty years old there is no other life incident evidencing he is a christian
4474663 a calculated decision to position yourself favorably in the eyes of those you want to lead whether you believe in the decision or not
4474664 along with other prominent black leaders such as al sharpton and barack obama farrakhan helped lead the million man march on washington
4474665 obamas supporters who clearly want to move obama as far away from farrakhan as possible will be certain to disavow that obama had any leadership role in farrakhans 1995 march
4474666 obamas 2006 trip to kenya evidenced his continued ties to a raila odinga a fellow luo tribesman who was running for president of kenya as a muslim sympathizer with well known communist political roots
4474667 obama by being seen this prominently with odinga in public had injected himself into the presidential contest on the side of his tribesman
4474668 senator obama has continued to insert himself into kenyan politics
4474669 morriss showing up in kenya makes no sense outside the obama odinga connection
4474670 morris had been openly critical of hillary clintons campaign against obama
4474671 as we shall see rezko was persistent ultimately convincing obama to drop working for political organizing causes so he could supplement the dwindling advance he had received at harvard to write a book with real income as a lawyer working the small chicago law firm where the lead partner did much of rezkos slumlord legal work for him
4474672 obama could work for rezko indirectly and benefit from rezkos connections
4474673 the likelihood is that rezko played a role in getting obama to join davis miner barnhill amp galland
4474674 alinsky taught that power was everything and that image words and positioning were just methods to capture power working from communities up
4474675 took steps that helped davis and rezko in their business relationship
4474676 continued to work for a law firm that had rezko as a client
4474677 there is no record that illinois state senator obama ever so much as placed a speech in the record objecting to the public housing practices perpetuated in his district by tony rezko let alone calling for investigation of rezko and his business practices
4474678 in an article titled obama is one lucky fellow rezko watch found it was unlikely that sreenan would actually construct any condos on the lot he had bought from rita rezko
4474679 even if no illegality is ever identified obamas continued willingness to take campaign contributions from his friend rezko even after serious allegations about rezkos low income housing empire began to be raised have the feel of impropriety
4474680 investigative reporters have drawn a line from obama to rezko to saddam husseins oil for food scandal with the key connecting point being billionaire nadhmi auchi
4474681 overlooked rezkos questionable activities to take money not just to finance his campaigns but to buy the mansion he feels his family deserves
4474682 if he sticks to the issues mccain will defeat barack obama
4474683 video clips that show his saying he wants to reduce the military
4474684 america seeks a world in which there are no nuclear weapons
4474685 he gave his famous antiwar speech in october 2002 but didnt officially declare his candidacy for the u
4474686 obama has consistently refused to support legislation that would define an infant who survives a late term induced labor abortion as a human being with the right to live
4474687 he insists that no restriction must ever be placed on the right of a mother to decide to abort her child
4474688 obama on the floor of the illinois state senate said that woman had an absolute right to abortion to kill the baby even if it survived that abortion
4474689 the government ends up collecting less capital gains tax revenue not more
4474690 the economics of this principle have been proved repeatedly in the two decades since reagan was president

4474737 around the globe wind generating capacity has been expanding at a rapid 30 clip in recent years
4474738 its most promising division is the production of structural wind towers
4474739 led by states such as texas and california wind farms around the country will generate almost 50 billion kilowatt hours of electricity this year of course the u s is still playing catch up with many other regions
4474740 in fact countries such as spain portugal and denmark all rely on wind farms for as much as one quarter of their total power needs
4474741 across europe wind turbines will account for roughly one third of all new generating capacity installed over the next few years and could provide electricity for 90 million people by 2010
4474742 the outlook is even brighter in many booming energy hungry asian markets in china installed wind power capacity surged 130 last year and will reportedly supply a great deal of the electricity needed for the upcoming 2008 beijing olympic games
4474743 thanks to the great strides in engineering wind turbine output has increased by a factor of ten or higher in some cases over the past decade
4474744 the power generating potential of wind is enormous the wind resources in north dakota alone are enough to power a staggering one third of the countrys total power needs
4474745 it comes as no surprise to hear that 36 billion will be spent on wind generating equipment this year i see trinity as a great way to participate
4474746 trinity is a top supplier of several different industrial product lines including railroad cars highway girders inland cargo barges and propane tanks all of which happen to be doing pretty well at the moment
4474747 however the firm has a large and growing stake in wind towers the company is among a handful of recognized leaders in the market for these giant tubes
4474748 this facet of the firms business is growing rapidly amid heated demand wind tower revenues have spiked 35 fold over the past four years soaring from just 11 million in 2004 to an expected 390 million this year
4474749 better still order backlog over the past 12 months has surged from 200 million to 1 6 billion representing a highly visible stream of future business within the next five years management is forecasting that wind tower revenues could double again to 800 million
4474750 even without energy equipment the firms other business segments alone merit a closer look
4474751 the firms fleet of 41 000 railroad cars available for lease is 99 6 utilized and the average lease has over five years remaining
4474752 these revenues are locked in and will provide some stability regardless of what happen on the product sales side

4474759 the normal business records that producers keep are all that are needed to prove compliance if they are audited
4474760 these records may include the inventory records sales receipts health papers etc that most farmers already have
4474761 there will be more communication and paperwork between buyers and sellers
4474762 keep documentation if you have animals of different origin on the same farm then be able to inform the buyer
4474763 ignored france germany george bush and even john mccain but he snapped to attention when he heard obama s request
4474764 we are not going to shoot we are not going to kill
4474765 we came here simply to restore order and now it is secure here see i can drive around unarmed
4474766 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4474767 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4474768 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4474769 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4474770 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4474771 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4474772 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4474773 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4474774 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4474775 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4474776 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4474777 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4474778 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4474794 the conduct of the presenters of the footy show in regard to the portrayal and treatment of women and the reaction and conduct of other people following the broadcast attracted widespread media interest and debate
4474795 what we found hard to work out is that she went out a week later and bought two tables at an auction to the footy show and rang the office here and demanded those tables be up the front
4474796 by pleading a purported defence of honest opinion the conduct of each of the defendants has been lacking in bona fides unjustified and unreasonable in a manner which has further aggravated the damage to the plaintiff

4474805 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase
4474806 everybody assumes they can resist such language but most of our decision making particularly under financial stress is made at an emotional and unconscious level and positive language and images like pictures of a gold card can all support the argument that we deserve this and as a result it debt is a lot easier to take on

4474811 but its timely to take a look at the awards and see where they are going

4474817 i am disappointed that the aeu is not open to looking at improving our training system
4474818 the aeu seems to be more interested in a recruitment campaign than negotiating a pay deal
4474819 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4474820 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4474821 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4474822 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4474823 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4474824 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4474825 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4474826 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4474827 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4474828 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4474829 i think this is a war that is much less about objective objectives as it is about emotional objectives
4474830 i just want to know if your athletes would listen to the us anthem or that of the virgin islands
4474831 all i know is we aint gonna win no gold medal
4474832 talks are under way and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment
4474833 it becomes very unimportant for me to comment on these reports i have been hearing all this for the past many months
4474834 we agreed with french president sarkozys main principles for resolving the conflict these principles must be accepted by the georgian side
4474835 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians
4474836 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4474837 it is more important for these politicians to tackle the problem of price hikes than this thing with the president
4474838 i suppose i will have to eat less so that i can send my three daughters to school
4474839 i dont mind if it is musharraf or any other politician i just want someone to give us some solace from these high prices
4474840 quest to find an orthodox biblical worldview for how god relates to us and the world remains ongoing
4474841 is simple enough like black coffee its just beans and water some people hate it some cannot start a day without it that god is the decider of fates may seem at first bitter to him that distrusts gods benevolent intentions but the sugar and cream of resulting joy and humility make the doctrines of grace more palatable for those who are learning the taste
4474842 more logical or biblical than arminianism but because it is satisfying certain cultural needs better than arminianism does
4474843 we have achieved what we set out to achieve in iraq
4474844 so it is possible to envisage a mission next year which is in the early hundreds
4474845 this is a real find for a time period that is not very well documented in that part of the world
4474846 now ossetians are running around and killing poor georgians in their enclaves
4474847 its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4474848 they used a john mellencamp song until he made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4474849 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission
4474850 the bacon from the designated bacon supplier was so fatty that you had to burn it black to make it edible
4474851 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4474852 i think both are going to be very difficult the 1500 has three rounds and those three rounds are very taxing so i think that is the race thats going to take a little bit more out of me
4474853 what happened in london was that i wanted to run a smart race but it wound up not being a smart race
4474854 i wanted to run basically strong at the end but i got boxed in with about 250 meters to go i wasnt planning that but ill use that as a learning process
4474855 once i got out of that trouble i started to kick hard i wasnt really disappointed but i learned something out of that race
4474856 that was good enough for me thats a good indication that my trainings been going well
4474857 everybody who makes the final especially the 5000 meters has a chance to win the race
4474858 everyone knows he can really run tough anytime he wants at the beginning of the race or at the end of the race so its really going to change everything
4474859 but my thinking is that everyones going to be tough but i also want to believe that my preparation coming here has been fantastic and i want to believe that im going to be ready for any kind of race thats going to develop
4474860 if it is fast from the beginning thatll be better because im used to that the only thing that i have to be very careful about is not to get tripped boxed in or pushed around its important to know my position when im running thats the most important thing and to know when to run hard
4474861 if i dont get it you know life is not about winning all the time after the race even if i dont get a medal i will embrace whoever won it because they worked hard and they deserve it
4474862 hay mucha tensi n en el municipio esto es muy triste la gente estaba celebrando cuando ocurri la explosi n
4474863 en el momento que sali a correr segundos despu s de lanzar el artefacto fue capturado por la polic a
4474864 en el sitio hab a mucha gente y todos estaban bailando cuando hubo la explosi n todo el mundo comenz a gritar y a correr a esta hora 12 40 am el pueblo est solo a penas hay movimiento por los lados del hospital
4474865 hay muchos negocios almacenes comercio bares y tiendas en la zona
4474866 its a positive sign that more people are getting involved in something that for so long has been the province of the very wealthy elite few
4474867 ive got more than 1200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters
4474868 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4474869 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot
4474870 why would you want to do that why not just blow on it and it displaces half your coffee
4474871 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed
4474872 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
4474873 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
4474874 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
4474875 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
4474876 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4474877 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4474878 the gori police chief is in gori trying to hold negotiations on the handover of the city
4474879 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4474880 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4474881 in order to get to that point there really did have to be important clarifications on a couple of these points in the ceasefire in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected
4474882 i am not planning to agree to any compromises with putins regime
4474883 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4474884 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4474885 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely ossetians and abkhaz can live in one state with georgians
4474886 critical importance of safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to all conflict affected areas
4474887 the premier and the government are now looking at how to respond to climate change but they dont recognise the scale of the problem or the scale and urgency of the response that is needed
4474888 how can you tell people climate change is important and then say were going to have this new black coal equivalent power station and were going to put lots of money into it
4474889 could scarcely empty a scuttle of ashes so handless was the poor creature
4474890 to sit back hoping that someday some way someone will make things right is to go on feeding the crocodile hoping he will eat you last but eat you he will
4474891 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
4474892 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
4474893 the winemakers cycle repeats itself over and over year after year always the same and always different and the winemaker is always hopeful
4474894 if there is anything i am lacking in ive got to tell you it is taste in music and art and other great things in life
4474895 here rests in honored glory a comrade in arms known but to god
4474896 for europe to stop treating putin like a democrat if all opposition parties are banned or what if they started shooting people in the street
4474897 staying engaged will always be the best hope for the people of both europe and russia
4474898 obama has outraised mccain from us troops stationed overseas by overwhelming ratios in both number and amount but the actual numbers are so damned small as to be statistically irrelevant
4474899 if you want to see reasoned analysis at its best you have to read the paragraph farmer
4474900 my friend patrick ohannigan shows why he is the jimi hendrix of pundits
4474901 frankly i think patrick ohannigan ought to be out there making a bazillion dollars from his writing

4474910 all previous booms have passed africa by the investment climates have been too hard
4474911 that an iron ore deposit in a remote corner of guinea a remote country most australians would have difficulty finding on the map could influence the prospects for a takeover that would represent a major consolidation in the international mining industry was certainly a situation no one would have predicted five years ago
4474912 it looks like they could have lost the whole thing even if they start negotiations with the president the sovereign risk you would have to say has gone up
4474913 in each negotiation baxter used its market power in the sterile fluids market to achieve exclusive dealing by means of bundling to endeavour to snuff out competition as it threatened in the pd peritoneal dialysis fluids market

4474919 its all about how quickly the consumer can get that confidence back and for that a lot of things need to be in place
4474920 if things work in favour and in the right way the confidence can come back fairly quickly but i think everything would have to be aligned for that to happen
4474921 every store you talk to every retailer you talk to they all have one common theme theres not as many people in the stores
4474922 it doesnt matter whether you talk to our stores or other peoples stores we all say to each other hows business mate and everyone says oh shit its a lot quieter and like everyone says that you dont find one who says oh it has picked up
4474923 what i think you can say so far this year is that retailers havent really understood the slowing down of the marketplace they have overreacted to the marketplace
4474924 they had a tough february and march recovered a bit in april worried about may so brought sales forward and they ended up with nothing in june
4474925 now i suggest to you that a lot of middle management in retail have never seen a seriously slow market
4474926 yes we have the potential in the next couple of years to be challenging but how many people are ready for a seriously challenging market
4474927 in general women stop spending on their home and their men first
4474928 people always buy cosmetics you always need a lipstick or your skin care they wont buy a new tv or fridge or bed and they will delay buying the new jumper for their husband
4474929 in our marketing programs these days in times of recession we must appeal to a broader market
4474930 the worst place to be in any recession is the middle ground
4474931 whether you are a manufacturer retailer or a service provider the worst place is the middle ground
4474932 it is not just the one off boutique its the small chain of 10 or 20 stores which hasnt really got scale yet that are finding it difficult because they dont have the leverage with an operating structure to support a much larger turnover base
4474933 i think that is challenging and the ones that will survive will be the very good operators
4474934 in our focus groups weve seen a number of people start to use this
4474935 the worse off people are the better off we are
4474936 yes people are more value conscious and they shop more often for smaller basket sizes which means they come to the local store
4474937 in tough times people shop more often for less they dont want to spend 200 in a massive woolworths store and be subject to all the promotions and impulse buys they spend 20 or 50 to feed the family for one or two days then come back it plays right into the hands of the local store
4474938 its been easy for everybody in australia for the last 13 years whether you are a manufacturer in advertising retailing in the hotel industry
4474939 when we hit a recession people dont stop going into shopping malls they dont stop going into retail stores in fact they spend more time in there what we need to do is once they get into those stores woo them in to spend their money on things that are different fun and innovative
4474940 if you can picture us as a family sitting at home with our friends what can we do to make that a nice evening people will spend more money on cheese instead of going out to restaurants we have to help them with that
4474941 predictably retailers will seek refuge in more aggressive price promotion and value offers
4474942 we are probably a month or two behind the uk in terms of economic severity there for instance grocery retailers like sainsburys have been offering to feed the family for a fiver look for more of the same here
4474943 no ones got a better barometer on economy than ive got no one because ive got a shop in every town in australia and ive got daily sales figures theres no business in my opinion that can pick up whats happening on a daily basis as we can woolies and coles cant bunnings cant

4474950 its a very rare occasion when something like this can be acquired
4474951 a woman who appeared particularly incongruous and out of place like a naked housewife in the artists somewhat spartan north balwyn suburban living room
4474952 since the previous months poll the cost of petrol in australia has dropped 8 per cent according to westpac figures
4474953 any respite for the already tired and stressed household budget would be seen as a positive and the falling oil price is doing its part helping to trim consumer fuel costs in just the last month the average household spend on fuel has fallen by almost 20 great news in helping to free up some much needed cash
4474954 consumers would also have been delighted to see an increase in pay packets over the last month courtesy of the tax cuts that took effect at the start of july while sentiment has improved it is still a far cry from the highs hit mid last year and the latest result still represents a generally pessimistic view
4474955 this may seem paradoxical at the moment with talk of restrained consumer spending and increasing unemployment but there are pockets of opportunities in retail property for savvy investors
4474956 over the year to june 2008 effective rent growth in sydney and brisbane was 25 per cent and 22 per cent respectively however as the global credit crunch continues landlord book values have come under pressure
4474957 while we have seen demand drop off in the financial sector other sectors like legal and recruitment are flourishing and in particular are taking advantage of new sub leasing opportunities
4474958 the highest rate of rental growth was experienced for secondary stock in the south
4474959 leasing activity was muted during the first six months of 2008 with less than 200 000 square metres leased across sydney in this time through 51 transactions significantly down pro rata on the 834 000 square metres leased during 2007
4474960 the south region experienced the largest number of leasing deals transacted during this period while the outer west and south west dominated the number of leasing deals in terms of space volume for the same period
4474961 the prestons development represents a great opportunity for major companies to lease valuable office and warehouse space on major road transport routes allowing them cost efficient operations
4474962 we believe one or a combination of the following triggers needs to occur to stimulate pent up demand house prices fall by 10 to 15 per cent rents rise by 15 to 20 per cent and or mortgage rates cut by 75 basis points
4474963 while we still think sydney office fundamentals are solid we believe they have peaked vacancy has crept up 60 basis points in the past six months to 4 3 per cent job growth is likely to slow to 0 75 per cent annually tenant incentives have increased and pay out ratios for the office real estate investment trust are among the highest due to high recurring capital expenditure
4474964 we are forecasting distributable income of 261 4 million and earnings per unit of 11 6 cents per unit up 11 5 per cent and 4 8 per cent respectively
4474965 the already announced distribution per unit of 12c is 3 4 per cent above the 2006 07 figure look for an update on any property income impacts from slowing consumer demand the renewal of discretionary tenant leases on passing rents and the lease up of new developments are two areas most at risk fashion tenants contribute about 25 per cent of net property income
4474966 we have women from all sorts of backgrounds hairdressers a bank manager an accountant food is really natural to women and women are very much customer focused
4474967 healthy habits fits in with where women really are with their healthy attitude it is almost about the future their health and that of their children i didnt consciously set out to tailor healthy habits around women but i knew it would appeal to mothers
4474968 they can still drop the kids at school and leave at 3pm to pick them up they can choose to never miss an assembly or sports day
4474969 there are far more expectations on women in business they still need to be mum wife social organiser but i am a mum and i also run a household as well as being a business woman so i understood what was needed
4474970 the business provides me with a relatively passive income so i can avoid the long hours of other types of franchises and still earn a fantastic income
4474971 doing everything in the business from cleaning parts and servicing the machines to invoicing takes an average of 20 hours a week
4474972 im doing something i really enjoy with the flexibility to manage my time between family and work life and im also supplementing my familys income it has created a balance in my life which is something all mothers want
4474973 the first thing women should do when they are looking at buying a franchise is to look for an industry which they feel passionate about you really have to love what you do
4474974 you should also do lots of research and this is an area in which women are particularly strong
4474975 no it doesnt the african emerging market index correlates with nothing
4474976 nothing is emerging in africa thus nothing correlates with nothing its simple maths
4474977 the great thing about the green movement is that they seriously believe we matter this is touching arrant nonsense
4474978 australians are eagerly willing to pay for a carbon emission trading system while the developing world spews ghastly muck into the atmosphere without caring a jot for all these little aussie battlers in the lead
4474979 banks buy banks the four pillar policy is about to collapse westpacs bid for st george is the beginning of the meltdown
4474980 its a dirty job but someone has to do it and look weve got the cash cochlear has bounced back
4474981 in a desperate love tryst four australian investment professionals vie for the heart of shaylene a polygamous colonoscopy nurse in utah its the beginning of a wonderful relationship boys
4474982 weve been brought up at dining tables talking about clothing
4474983 we always kept coming up with some gimmick angle to keep the market growing
4474984 my brother and i would fight i thought what am i doing here
4474985 hed turn up the next day crack a joke and wed be back into it
4474986 small business employers who are obligated to pay the current compulsory superannuation guarantee suffer a form of sticker shock when they calculate the 9 per cent they must pay below their wages line
4474987 there are relatively few employers who would remember that the compulsory superannuation guarantee origins were collective bargaining and the national wages policy were it not to exist their actual wages bill would be commensurately higher the use of the taxation power to collect it has probably not enhanced some employers views of it
4474988 most payroll systems are fully automated and an increase from 9 to 10 per cent will be handled by that software
4474989 for smes which do manual calculations of every payroll especially micro businesses there will be more work
4474990 for example an employee will receive a total package of 54 500
4474991 if insufficient funds were raised from the issue to cover the companys working capital requirements further funding may be required by the company
4474992 would have a materially adverse effect on the companys ability to operate as a going concern
4474993 we do see a very busy year coming this year with the drinking and partying and i think that well do well
4474994 as ceo of empowernet i see this merger as an exciting new stage in the growth of the company
4474995 there are many synergies between ourselves and sfs and as a combined entity we look forward to capitalising on both new and existing opportunities within our shared markets
4474996 money gives people greater control and freedom over their lives
4474997 a lethal combination that will annihilate your competition blow them out of the water without even seeing or hearing you sneaking up on them
4474998 send a direct mail letter to client profile b a cross sell promotion that is irresistible by creating reciprocity first and then removing the offer with brian tracys classic take away phrase this may not be for you
4474999 the taser is a useful weapon and it worked on this occasion to allow police to arrest him safely
4475000 until we can see sentiment improving its still going to be tough for developers
4475001 in recognition of weaker market conditions in all regions management has marked all investment property assets to market as at june 30 2008 all canadian investment property has been independently revalued a representative sample of about one quarter of the australian and european portfolios has been independently revalued with all remaining investment properties marked to market using comparable metrics
4475002 the canadian revaluations reflect both an easing in capitalisation rates and an increase in the valuers allowances for future leasing costs and vacancy
4475003 during the first seven months of 2008 the fund has sold over 120 million of secondary and non core real estate at a weighted average cap rate of 7 35 per cent these sales compare very favourably with the average capitalisation rate for australian secondary assets of 7 68 per cent
4475004 a combination of weak demand and rising completions pushed the second quarter vacancy rate up 34 basis points to register 8 52 per cent in individual metro areas 36 markets experienced an increased vacancy rate while 20 saw vacancies go down

4475015 access to credit is becoming increasingly difficult so while other project fundamentals might stack up some new projects are still in jeopardy
4475016 we see the current holding pattern for interest rates as a small relief in the current climate
4475017 rising interest rates and a general tightening of lending criteria have impacted on project viability and weakness in the residential sector is being masked by growth in other sectors particularly commercial and engineering thus keeping pressure on construction costs in general

4475030 it would seem that palo pinto county has a lot last day to see 2 exhibits new york waters amp twilight on the streetsblog last day to see 2 exhibits new york waters amp twilight on the
4475031 and we should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once and we should call every truth false which was not accompanied by at least one laugh
4475032 i think that one of the two will come now that they have seen the success of aldi and with the possibility of zoning for stores being made easier i wouldnt be surprised at all its an advanced market
4475033 australia is seen as a natural area to expand in the asia pacific region
4475034 aldi has been able to grow without those planning changes so its only going to make it easier for others
4475035 anticipates that the 2008 09 distribution will not be less than the 2007 08 distribution of 13 05 cpu the distributions will be payable entirely from cashflow and does not include any benefit from the buy back of additional units or any profits from potential opportunistic property sales
4475036 we have no short term refinancing risk a well located diversified property portfolio and an experienced asset management team in tokyo
4475037 the tokyo office market where our assets are predominantly based still has low vacancies of about 4 per cent which is at historically low levels there is sign of some slowing but the japanese property market fundamentals remain sound
4475038 we dont want the archetypal city idiot waving his cash about at the bar and braying like a buffoon and annoying women

4475042 its a club so i guess everybody has the right to decide which clients they want to have theyd rather have a client thats more into arts than money
4475043 have a great time looking at all these great funky people and really people are looking at them thinking whats happening to this club
4475044 to reject only on the point that theyre coming from a banking background its like discrimination

4475046 nearly 1 million taxpayers will need to do no more than lodge their pre filled return electronically millions more will need to provide only a few additional pieces of information to complete their returns
4475047 the figures are disastrous the economy is being hit on all fronts consumption which had been the main contributor to growth for some time is being hit by soaring inflation and tighter lending conditions
4475048 the bad thing is that we do not see a significant change in this situation in the coming months indeed most of the negative factors affecting the economy will remain in place for the rest of 2008
4475049 against this backdrop the recession in france defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth is an increasingly likely scenario
4475050 i am one of those people suffering pain im a major investor in the fund as are many of the other directors and we are suffering exactly the same as the other investors are suffering the same consequences
4475051 i feel extremely concerned for the unit holders that are not getting their distributions and will not receive them next month the business still has to run and the business still has to ensure that we dont lose our investors capital and the management fees that it earns through the fund
4475052 there appears to be a shift in the willingness of firms to raise prices
4475053 costs are rising so rapidly that many businesses have no choice but to pass along price increases
4475054 with gasoline and other consumer energy prices rising in recent weeks inflation seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term
4475055 retailers are saying that china is getting too costly and they have to shift their operations out of china
4475056 wages are escalating there and shipping prices are out of control
4475057 customer is reflective of society in general while some of them live pay cheque to pay cheque our customers represent a broad income segment and they are all challenged today
4475058 when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation in health care and core food items theres a great deal of pressure on the customer
4475059 clearly the future direction of interest rates and employment levels will impact on the environment in which the company will be operating in fiscal 2009
4475060 in these circumstances it is not possible to accurately forecast results for the 2009 year
4475061 this is a good result in a tight retail environment
4475062 images of these packs stuffed in jeans pockets can give kids the wrong idea it turns this into an alcoholic candy bar

4475070 oh my how am i ever going to fit this in
4475071 the only place you dont want to be in the second half of this calendar year is in the call centre of a superannuation fund
4475072 and thats not up significantly on what the normal year end call volume is for us
4475073 the advantage for us is that advisers take a lot of the heat it may be that if you have a large percentage of advised business as we do that it may enable you to get through that hump quicker
4475074 how well has disclosure worked for our customers well its worked about as well for our customers as it has for any customers in the industry and that is it hasnt worked very well at all
4475075 disclosure is a necessary but far from sufficient consumer protection mechanism
4475076 the bureau of statistics earlier this year released the latest version of their life skills and numeracy survey
4475077 nearly one in two australian adults could not meet that criteria
4475078 there is a yawning gulf between our materials and consumers financial literacy and the notion thats put forward from time to time that disclosure in its various guises can bridge that gap is just utter rubbish
4475079 ive put commissions first slightly tongue in cheek but not wholly tongue in cheek of course there are a lot of financial planners who derive a substantial proportion of their income through commissions and through either their own personal preferences or those of their employers dont promote those funds that dont pay commissions
4475080 theres a big and growing market of advisers who are happy to sell products that do not pay commissions
4475081 if youve got no commission you can stand in the market and win but you have got to pay strict attention to those issues i went through before because if you cant tick those boxes theres not going to be demand for the product
4475082 does paying for advice meet the sole purpose test i think it does provided that the advice bears on superannuation
4475083 but its stretching the very elastic beast that is the sole purpose test to breaking point i reckon if we say that superannuation monies can be used to provide advice on non superannuation issues youre getting really into swiss chalet territory there i think
4475084 but an issue i want to raise in this area is to do with subsidisation the question around subsidised advice
4475085 product manufacturers subsidise for want of a better word advice givers in many forms commissions is one actually hiring internal planners and everyones looking at that at the moment at salaried planners ownership of dealer groups through capital subsidy or direct payment of advice fees
4475086 when a product manufacturer subsidises in that sense advice theres a potential conflict but does that mean its bad
4475087 in my view no because it gives access to reasonable advice in a cost effective way
4475088 potential for conflicts can produce good outcomes for consumers because they will be better advised and better insured
4475089 weve got an interesting point here about the intersection between public policy and private delivery
4475090 i dont think its in the interests of any party in the industry for the competitiveness to ebb away we are the custodians of the nations retirement incomes policy except for that part of it that is held by the government which is principally the social security system and the age pension
4475091 so we have this act of parliament which dictates that this torrent of money is in our hands and that behoves us i think to operate in a way or be conscious of the fact that this is not an entirely competitive market
4475092 that puts an extra onus i think on all of us in the industry to act with public policy considerations in mind rather than strictly commercial considerations in mind
4475093 if the business models remain broadly as they are there should always be a material margin between the two thats a structural issue that defines the differences between the two funds
4475094 i cant see them having parity with one another nor can i see them getting effectively close to parity so theres no material difference
4475095 price is only ever relevant to the utility you derive for that price
4475096 theres been an enormous amount of work done and we talk about innovation and efficiencies and productivity thats been brought to bear in the last 15 to 20 years which is manifest in the way these products are built and the efficiencies they provide in the advice market
4475097 there is no better person in the market to understand service levels than advisers simply because they do hundreds if not thousands of transactions a year with hundreds of different providers
4475098 they get a better feel better than any consultant better than any single player as to who has the best efficiency and accuracy and timeliness around service
4475099 i asked what it was for and he eric said that craig stubbs fincorps then chief executive wanted it to be moved out of fincorp so i signed the document
4475100 i am trying to be better and im optimistic my second album will be better than this
4475101 as part of its social responsibility and unwavering quest to contribute to national development sanlam namibia introduced the music awards in 2003 in conjunction with the nbc we responded to calls from artists and music industry players for a platform to recognise brilliant music
4475102 we are proud to state that our efforts have been rewarded by the positive developments in the music industry as well as personal growth of individual artists we have met all the objectives that we set ourselves when this initiative was conceived
4475103 since inception more than 150 recognition awards and certificates have been given to musicians producers and other stakeholders over n 350 000 has been given out as cash prizes to artists of which more than 750 have entered for the event
4475104 more than 50 artists have been given a platform to perform at the main event as well as a wider audience of the nbc tv viewers our third objective was to encourage and motivate the public to appreciate namibian music and musicians the ever increasing volumes of namibian music played on our different radio and television stations at parties and functions in homes and our cars is testimony that interest in local music has grown
4475105 our message is that nothing compares to the live experience we invite anyone who is interested in hearing exceptional music to attend and encounter the unique experience
4475106 old mutual would also like to acknowledge the importance of our continued partnership with both air namibia and kalahari sands on this initiative as customary in the past artists will be flown in by our national airline whilst the hotel and entertainment centre will take care of all accommodation needs
4475107 we have known each other with akon for six to eight years now we met in london i think we are now more than friends i and akon and his family are tight
4475108 im the only woman he knows in africa so he calls me whenever he is around i have been with him in all the african countries he has been to like nigeria tanzania and other places like miami in the us he even called me yesterday he had a show in japan
4475109 the other girls felt bad about it but you see whenever he is with other girls some of them are funny they take his money his bling bling and akon does not like that
4475110 one of the girls actually pinched me real hard when we were with akon in club sway some even showed me the middle finger
4475111 the games have provided us with a unique opportunity to demonstrate continued support for chinas long term development and its emerging role in the international community
4475112 oil gas coal and uranium will be big movers in the future
4475113 china has a big cheque book but it would be an enormous disservice to australia economically for a sell off of a national champion like bhp billiton or woodside
4475114 the ideals that the olympic movement promotes such as achievement integrity and respect mirror our own set of values which determine the way we do business
4475115 the olympic village project was a contractual roller coaster youve got to work in china the chinese way
4475116 whos to say that our way of sticking to the fine print of the contract is the best way
4475117 we had six australian and three chinese architects together with six to eight engineers working in sydney
4475118 we won the competition for the bid in 2003 and i moved to china the following year and construction started we won the olympic village competition six months later
4475119 the chinese government will never reveal the final construction cost
4475120 after the games the building will be gutted one pool retained and refitted with shops to make it commercially viable
4475121 about 40 australian firms ranging from small firms installing sprinklers and smoke detectors in buildings to bhp billiton are involved in the games
4475122 medieval england was as incentivised as thatchers england tax rates averaged 1 per cent property rights were secure violence was limited social mobility was extensive
4475123 we are adapted to capitalism we differ culturally and genetically from our forebears of the stone age
4475124 some societies had little experience of such a pre industrial regime some even went straight from foraging to the modern economy as australian aboriginals did in 1788
4475125 these societies have historically rooted disadvantages in competing in a capitalist world their response to market incentives can be limited this may explain the extraordinary difficulty forager groups such as australian aboriginals have had in successfully incorporating into capitalism
4475126 in all these societies without any initial wealth or political advantage the chinese and indians dominated the commercial economy and became the business class
4475127 its a very rare occasion when something like this can be acquired

4475129 en lo que nosotros denominamos comunidad sustentada en la realidad
4475130 cree que las soluciones se derivan de vuestro juicioso estudio de la realidad discernible
4475131 ese ya no es el modo en el que el mundo realmente funciona
4475132 ahora somos un imperio y cuando actuamos creamos la realidad y mientras vosotros est is estudiando esa realidad juiciosamente si quieres actuamos de nuevo creando otras nuevas realidades que tambi n pod is estudiar y as es como las cosas se organizan somos actores de la historia y a vosotros a todos vosotros s lo os queda estudiar lo que hacemos
4475133 aunque las masas conforman el ornamento no est n implicadas en planificarlo

4475136 no es verdad que el actual sistema pol tico es un absurdo
4475137 the parrhesiates says what is true because he knows that it is true and he knows that its true because it is really true the parrhesiatesis not only sincere and says what is his opinion but his opinion is also the truth he says what he knows to be true there is always an exact coincidence between belief and truth
4475138 indeed from the perspective of the law seduction was considered more criminal than rape for when someone is raped it is against his or her will but when someone is seduced then that constitutes the proof that at a specific moment the seduced individual chose to be unfaithful to his or her wife or husband or parents or family
4475139 parrhesia is opposed to self ignorance and the false teachings of the sophists
4475140 but thats diogenes game hitting his interlocutors pride forcing him to recognize that he is not what he claims to be which is something quite different from the socratic attempt to show someone that he is ignorant of what he claims to know
4475141 seneca does not know exactly what is the reason for his waverings but he characterizes his malaise as a kind of perpetual vacillating motion which has no other movement than rocking the boat cannot advance because it is rocking here we have an oscillating motion of rocking which prevents the movement of the mind from advancing towards the truth towards steadiness towards the ground
4475142 democracy has become lack of self restraint liberty has become lawlessness happiness has become the freedom to do whatever one pleases it is impossible to enjoy both democracy and parrhesia

4475145 proyecto personalista que vulnera el rol del militar venezolano y degrada las instituciones castrenses de la naci n
4475146 es asombroso como la carrera profesional de los militares quedar rebajada a su m nima expresi n con la instalaci n de un pensamiento pol tico que viola los preceptos democr ticos de nuestra carta magna vigente sencillamente con la lofan los efectivos estar n apegados a las decisiones de un jerarca sin valorar los m ritos obtenidos en los distintos grados militares y la preparaci n en las escuelas oficiales
4475147 si desde la llegada del presidente ch vez al poder se ha puesto en pr ctica una persecuci n indiscriminada contra los libres pensadores que se apegan a los preceptos democr ticas que siempre han prevalecido en las aulas militares ahora con la acumulaci n de todo el poder de decisi n en manos de una sola persona los funcionarios que no comparten la ideolog a chavista sufrir n las persecuciones de rigor
4475148 no resultar para nada extra o observar a los militares venezolanos haciendo campa a pol tica del partido socialista unido de venezuela psuv en pa ses vecinos con el prop sito de enaltecer los logros de la revoluci n bolivariana y llevar el mensaje militarista que emplea el gobierno nacional en el territorio nacional

4475267 in the sex industry a strip club is considered a safe sex work option its safe because you have bouncers staff and no contact options
4475268 for me exotic dancing saved me it was about performing it was about art it was about power and money
4475269 but it wasnt about having strangers touch my body in that way i find it really scary that exotic dance clubs are closing
4475270 with mugs and jugs closing were near the end of no contact options for women making a living in the sex industry

4475283 mugs and jugs was one of the clubs that was profitable
4475284 i did a poll on the naked truth with the dancers who are members of the naked truth mugs and jugs was rated number 1 as the most favourite club to work at
4475285 they have really great management you can go in there it is non contact vip dances the security is good the staff are amazing it is a very supportive environment to work at some places dont have security if dancers run into trouble they had to take care of it themselves
4475286 its just so sad all these clubs are closing we were going to hold our exotic dancers for cancer event there this year it is our signature event
4475287 i was going to hold it at the club rated number 1

4475295 this presidential election if it goes one way we could see a reimposition of the fairness doctrine i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate and i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem then whoevers in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine

4475306 the intense rain outside continues unabated and far in the distance the torn grey clouds merge with the earth obscuring any hint of a horizon a fitting scenery to a final act of ignominy i attended seven and a half funereal hours of meetings yesterday initially with celtic frost triptykon manager antje lange then including martin eric ain and celtic frost s accountant to discuss in detail the dissolution of most of celtic frost s business arrangements and the distribution of the groups remaining assets what an infinitely doleful and emotionally draining undertaking and one i did not ever wish to witness and yet one that was probably unavoidable

4475310 pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah kucukupkan kepadamu nikmatku dan telah kuridloi islam sebagai agama bagimu
4475311 apakah mereka mempunyai sesembahan sesembahan selain allah yang mensyariatkan untuk mereka agama yang tidak diridloi allah sekiranya tak ada ketetapan yang menentukan dari allah tentulah mereka telah dibinasakan dan sesungguhnya orang orang yang dhalim itu akan memperoleh azab yang pedih
4475312 barang siapa yang mengada adakan sesuatu perbuatan dalam agama yang sebelumnya tidak pernah ada maka tidak akan diterima
4475313 barang siapa mengerjakan suatu perbuatan yang belum pernah kami perintahkan maka ia tertolak
4475314 amma badu sesungguhnya sebaik baik perkataan adalah kitab allah al quran dan sebaik baik petunjuk adalah petunjuk muhammad shalallahu alaihi wa sallam dan sejelek jelek perbuatan dalam agama adalah yang diada adakan dan setiap bidah yang diada adakan itu sesat
4475315 hai orang orang yang beriman taatilah allah dan taatilah rasul nya dan ulil amri pemimpin diantara kamu kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesutu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah al quran dan rasul al hadits jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian yang demikian itu adalah lebih utama bagimu dan lebih baik akibatnya
4475316 tentang sesuatu apapun kamu berselisih maka putusannya terserah kepada allah yang mempunyai sifat sifat demikian itulah tuhanku kepadanya lah aku bertawakkal dan kepadanya lah aku kembali
4475317 katakanlah jika kamu benar benar mencintai allah maka ikutilah aku niscaya allah akan mengasihi dan mengampuni dosa dosamu
4475318 maka demi tuhanmu mereka pada hakekatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu sebagai hakim terhadap perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa sesuatu keberatan dalam hati mereka terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya

4475321 pahala yang didapat dari ibadah pada malam nisfu syaban menyamai pahala lailatul qadar ibnu abi mulaikah menjawab
4475322 wahai ali barang siapa yang melakukan sholat pada malam nisfu syaban sebanyak 100 rakaat ia membaca setiap rakaat al fatihah dan qul huwallah ahad sebanyak sepuluh kali pasti allah memenuhi segala kebutuhannya dan seterusnya
4475323 seratus rakaat pada malam nisfi syaban dengan membaca surah al ikhlas sepuluh kali pada setiap rakaat bersama keutamaan keutamaan yang lain diriwayatkan oleh ad dailami dan lainya bahwa itu semua maudlu palsu dan mayoritas perowinya pada ketiga jalur sanadnya majhul tidak diketahui dan dloif lemah imam as syaukani berkata hadits yang menerangkan bahwa dua belas rakaat dengan membaca surat al ikhlas tiga puluh kali itu maudlu palsu dan hadits empat belas rakaat dan seterusnya adalah maudlu tidak bisa diamalkan dan harus ditinggalkan pent para fuqoha ahli yurisprudensi banyak yang tertipu dengan hadits hadits diatas seperti pengarang ihya ulumuddin dan lainnya juga sebagian dari para ahli tafsir karena sholat pada malam ini yakni malam nisfu syaban telah diriwayatkan melalui berbagai jalur sanad semuanya adalah bathil tidak benar dan haditsnya adalah maudlu hal ini tidak bertentangan dengan riwayat turmudzi dan hadits aisyah bahwa rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wa sallam pergi ke baqi dan tuhan turun ke langit dunia pada malam nisfu syaban untuk mengampuni dosa sebanyak jumlah bulu domba dan bulu kambing karena pembicaraan kita berkisar tentang sholat yang diadakan pada malam nisfu syaban itu tetapi hadits aisyah ini lemah dan sanadnya munqothi tidak bersambung sebagaimana hadits ali yang telah disebutkan diatas mengenai malam nisfu syaban jadi dengan jelas bahwa sholat khusus pada malam itu juga lemah dasar hukumnya al hafidz al iraqi berkata hadits yang menerangkan tentang sholat nisfi syaban itu maudlu dan pembohongan atas diri rasulallah
4475324 pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah kucukupkan kepadamu nimatku dan telah kuridloi islam sebagai agama bagimu
4475325 barang siapa yang mengada adakan sesuatu perbuatan dalam agama yang sebelumnya tidak pernah ada maka ia tertolak
4475326 janganlah kamu sekalian mengkhususkan malam jumat dari pada malam malam lainnya dengan sholat tertentu dan janganlah kamu sekalian mengkhususkan siang harinya dari pada hari hari lainnya dengan berpuasa tertentu kecuali jika hari bertepatan dengan hari yang ia biasa berpuasa bukan puasa khusus tadi
4475327 barang siapa yang berdiri melakukan sholat pada bulan ramadlan dengan penuh rasa iman dan harapan pahala niscaya allah subhaanahu wa taala akan mengampuni dosanya yang telah lewat dan barang siapa yang berdiri melakukan sholat pada malam lailatul qadar dengan penuh rasa iman dan harapan pahala niscaya allah akan mengampuni dosa dosanya yang telah lewat
4475328 sebaik baik perkara adalah yang telah dikerjakan oleh para salaf yang telah mendapatkan petunjuk dan sejelek jelek perkara dalam agama adalah yang diada adakan berupa bidah bidah

4475342 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4475343 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience

4475399 it set an important new precedent saying that if you must build an importance piece of infrastructure in city parks it must be mitigated with new or improved parkland
4475400 unfortunately some businesses will continue to look for ways to charge excessive interest rates
4475401 it is absolutely in the spirit of the law and to the letter of the law
4475402 remember they had to be dragged to the line to do anything about it
4475403 now it looks like they just got to the point of embarrassment and had to show the government was doing something and its not good enough
4475404 we were pleased with the tough stance from the government but if there is a loophole we would want them to take action and investigate the situation
4475405 when the 58 per cent increase in the cost of money is considered one can easily surmise that rents must rise significantly otherwise investors will keep their money in high interest accounts
4475406 were celebrating our 125th birthday on august 17 but a lot of us feel that not much has changed in all these years
4475407 the most atrocious example was the torture inflicted on the notorious voyage of the ss angers during which most of the shipload of cattle died raising a cry of horror throughout england and australia it may be imagined what are the sufferings of unhandled animals improperly cooped up on vessels when passing through the tropics
4475408 another thing is that when people think about the rspca they think about dogs and cats but back in the old days our work was a lot more to do with horses and ponies

4475411 they will never forget you til somebody new comes along
4475412 perhaps the most surprising story about barack obama and money is one that no one talks about at all it involves ping pong it is the story of how state senator obama was paid more than 100 000 for legal work then helped his clients company get 320 000 in taxpayer grants
4475413 obama and his supporters have downplayed the legal retainer and grant
4475414 he obama consulted with shoman still his main political adviser
4475415 like the ill advised connection to obama in aurora thanks to dan shomon obama is mentioned in the same discusion with all these problems with giannoulias
4475416 shomons main activities are political campaigns and helping obama and his friends like alexi giannoulias who is now the treasurer for the state of illinois
4475417 we think its highly unethical of dan shomon or tom weisner to exploit the taxpayers of aurora for political purpose barack obamas credibility is also risked in the process of shomon and weisners games at the expense of taxpayers
4475418 in the 2006 democratic primary for example obama endorsed first time candidate alexi giannoulias for state treasurer despite reports about loans giannoulias family owned broadway bank made to crime figures records show giannoulias and his family had given more than 10 000 to obamas campaign which banked at broadway
4475419 andy martin says retainer by robert blackwell jr was classic illinois pay to play and may have been criminal behavior
4475420 after just a few years obama was talking about running for congress and thought he saw an opportunity in 1999 black congressman bobby rush had challenged richard m daley for mayor and lost obama conducted a poll says then campaign manager dan shomon and it suggested that some voters particularly white ones were looking for an alternative to rush
4475421 and he wasnt going to try to press me into ordering anything i agreed to try it for a couple weeks
4475422 the end of the cold war was supposed to usher in a new age in which the major powers would no longer dictate to their neighbors how to run their affairs
4475423 this program was implemented as a means to keep these kids busy and out of trouble as well as give them a sense of citizenship and teach them about the importance of why they need to keep their environment clean
4475424 i think the parents love it because all the kids are actually out doing something together working toward community goals and leaving their differences aside forming a good community
4475425 i would like to see this as a success story and implemented throughout iraq in future years to come
4475426 this taking of responsibility in lutifiyah shows that the ia is ready to protect that the ia is ready to fight and that the ia is ready to take control completely away from the enemy
4475427 we celebrate the taking over of security because 4 years ago this area suffered from collapse and was called a ghost city
4475428 most families here lost family members but from support of the coalition we switched this area to become very secure
4475429 aug 8 was our last day on the patrol base
4475430 this is one of the most prepared bns in the 17th ia div they are ready to take over
4475431 remember sacrifice today as today is a day of celebration we celebrate the bravery and hard work of these men
4475432 you have fought to free the people of this area from fear and intimidation now the ia stands strong to protect from the corrupt and the criminal
4475433 the iraqis now have a local police force to protect the people and handle the routine activities and business related to security here in radwaniyah
4475434 within a week of their arrival the goi launched the charge of the knights op to restore the rule of law here in basra
4475435 let me thank the leaders and the people of basra
4475436 basra now stands poised to be the economic miracle of the gulf with the sf providing security it will soon rival dubai or bahrain
4475437 we continue to take criminals off the streets to provide a safer and more secure environment for the iraqi citizens
4475438 there area lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4475439 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4475440 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4475441 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4475442 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4475443 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4475444 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4475445 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4475446 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4475447 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4475448 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia
4475449 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4475450 its quiet there but now there are problems with food

4475452 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4475453 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4475454 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4475455 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4475456 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4475457 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4475458 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now

4475479 like any top sportsman who senses he or she has the ability we are obviously disappointed to have so narrowly missed out on victory in june even so we played a leading role in what proved to be a thrilling race and we can be proud of the tremendous exemplary work our team has put in since the beginning of this project thanks to everyones untiring efforts we went to le mans this year with three cars which all had the necessary legs and reliability to contest what turned out to be a 24 hour sprint at full song the performance potential of the 908 hdi fap meant we were able to play several joker cards but we ended up needing one too many this years winner emerged after a fierce battle between the two main players who both deserve respect for their efforts and encouragement for the future we now have every intention of keeping up our effort in order to be in a position to top the podium in 2009
4475480 we have called on our core driver line up for this race but marc christian pedro and st phane will be joined by alexander and christian there are two reasons behind this decision to begin with they are both available while at the same time this race will give them a chance to gain extra experience of endurance racing
4475481 as last junes le mans showed it takes experience to take on a competitor that has the benefit of 10 years of this race behind it and which stays match fit by contesting 12 more races during the season compared with peugeot namely the alms in which it faces opponents like porsche and acura
4475482 thats what i like you slut let us know what were doing to you

4475485 was good at harassing journalists trying to find out the truth
4475486 presents russia as surrounded by enemies on all sides near and far and the military intervention in georgia as essential to protect the lives and interests of russians
4475487 the administrations of the georgian breakaway areas of abkhazia and south ossetia are stocked top to bottom with bureaucrats from the russian security services
4475488 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
4475489 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
4475490 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
4475491 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
4475492 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

4475531 evidence suggests that as joseph smith was translating he apparently saw some mark or perhaps extra spacing whenever a section ended but was unable to see the text that followed

4475544 but hes grant hackett and hes raced through these things before
4475545 its really only about being sensible about personal hygiene and preparation
4475546 the guy is the best the sport has ever seen no denying that the best the olympics have ever seen
4475547 but it would be good for the sport if he lost
4475548 lets be honest about that its true it would be good and you know its good to lose sometimes i know because ive lost a lot i think it would be good for the sport and good for him if he lost once just once
4475549 for him what would it mean i would hope that he would cut down his events for the next year and start training more for the 100 metres fly to help that event prosper
4475550 ive got nothing against michael phelps the guy is the king but do i want a make a rivalry of this sure why not but i have never disrespected anybody and im definitely not going to start with michael phelps
4475551 i gave that a little bit of thought but i dont like to put any more pressure on myself than i already am
4475552 it would be nice that one day historically they will speak of michael phelps maybe winning seven gold medals and having lost an opportunity to win eight gold when they talk about that they will talk about whoever that guy is that took it away from him i would love to be that guy
4475553 id like to bring my country the first swimming medal ever im just going to give it my best and if bronze is my best then then thats good enough for me but again im not going to give it the gold to him phelps
4475554 hopped in had a swim climbed out as quickly as i could
4475555 im so thankful for that because in athens i never got another opportunity so to come out there was wonderful
4475556 i really wanted to give it my absolute all i wanted to be hurting right at the end of it and i definitely did that full credit to britta she swam a fantastic race
4475557 really it didnt matter whether i got a medal or not but the way i see it i didnt lose gold i won silver
4475558 i think we will lift and team spirit will get us over the line
4475559 eat what i want to eat do what i want to do probably go ice skating roller blading and snowboarding all the things i couldnt do before
4475560 we are so successful as a nation in swimming and also seeing someone like michael phelps being so successful its always forgivable to go its easy to win a gold medal but its not its really hard but for me this was the way it was meant to happen
4475561 you can always go what if what if i did that better or what if i did this better if i was gold medallist i wouldnt think about that stuff you can always do that but why do that because its done its done
4475562 why not enjoy this moment and enjoy the achievement because its a huge achievement i have no regrets im so glad i got another opportunity which i didnt get in athens
4475563 very difficult and very emotional but thats been fairly standard throughout my career
4475564 no no no it would have been great to get the gold but at the end of the day i walk away a silver medallist at the olympics
4475565 people might think i could potentially be disappointed in my position but there is no way i could ever be disappointed i could have been out yesterday i was ninth i shouldnt have been in that final to walk away a silver medallist rather than ninth position its awesome
4475566 its 0 04 and its such a small margin but thats how it fell and thats fine
4475567 its going to push me further not just in swimming but in my life to always do things how i want to do them and enjoy every moment because you never know when its going to be your last one im going to enjoy this whole meet and atmosphere and moment because there is so much more to life
4475568 my family and friends are really proud of me and thats more important than any gold medal
4475569 i dont know i have two more events to swim then i have three months off and thats what im thinking about right now

4475583 the normal diet of the mbu is shellfish which help to keep their teeth worn down exactly like the gnawing rodents do to keep theirs at a manageable length
4475584 but following the fight we noticed henry had become lazy and was just chewing his food with the flat edge of the worn tooth instead of using the good one
4475585 now that good tooth has grown so long he cannot close his mouth and its starting to cut his bottom lip so we had to take drastic action it is a bit like being buck toothed

4475683 our family today still feels that the ruling just proves again that the justice system here in new orleans is still flawed
4475684 the danziger case is yet another example of a police department in crisis and a criminal justice system unwilling to keep them in check
4475685 the incident was further characterized by the nopd as the attempted murders of a st landry parish deputy sheriff and seven other new orleans officers but the deputy sheriff was later revealed to be a former police officer with a criminal record participating in the shooting while posing as a deputy
4475686 leonard bartholomew 44 his wife susan 39 and daughter leisha 17 were shot by the police

4475688 officer robert faulcon charged with first degree murder in the death of ronald madison says he shot the victim with a shotgun when madison turned toward the officer and reached into his waistband desalvo defense attorney says the victim was shot in the back because the gunfight was fluid and people were moving
4475689 susan bartholomew lost an arm to what the family believes was a point blank shotgun blast
4475690 nineteen year old jose holmes who had been hit twice and whose right arm was shattered hid behind a cement slab in a walkway alongside the bridge
4475691 later investigation revealed at least some of the shooting was by residents trapped by floodwater trying to attract the attention of rescue parties

4475784 well you know i kind of need to play when i sing
4475785 here im saying clearly i oppose barack obama and the book is designed to lay this information out and let the american public decide
4475786 he was registered as a muslim the documentation i thoroughly researched it from the indonesian newspapers and indonesian television he attended mosque with his stepfather
4475787 the friends who were in school with him attest that he was then considered a muslim and thats the testimony of the people in indonesia who grew up in those six years
4475788 right now vile smear peddler jerome corsi is back with a new book of lies this time about barack obama well need the combined efforts of every member of the action wire to push back against this years vicious republican attack book

4475800 one of my competitors walking out said it reminded her of melbourne for the commonwealth games so there you go
4475801 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4475802 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4475803 down by an average of 1 37 per barrel per session
4475804 we havent really had a chance to take it all in yet and now were about to start it all over again
4475805 shes singing on every track weve pretty much sort of taken off where we left off on the last record but where the previous record was pretty much a studio album this time weve tried to make a record that reflects our live performances a little better
4475806 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4475807 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4475808 down by an average of 1 37 per barrel per session
4475809 i believe hes entitled to be compensated for his role in the show
4475810 weve lodged documents seeking declarations that he is in fact entitled to be adequately compensated and weve asked that the matter be referred to an associate judge for an audit to be done
4475811 its going to be a complex and drawn out exercise but i would have thought were talking millions its amazing where this series has been shown
4475812 theres merchandising involved dvds so yes i think it could be millions
4475813 its not about the money at all and anybody who knows me will testify to that
4475814 if theyd just said thank you to me 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 then that wouldve been the end of it
4475815 but theyve never even bought me a cup of coffee for years people have thought i was earning a lot of money from the show but i havent received a single cent since my last pay cheque from fauna about 200 in 1968
4475816 when i saw the latest boxed set of dvds i thought ive had enough
4475817 when i signed on for the first season of skippy i was a young and probably naive actor and i was given a verbal agreement that if the show was successful after the first season then wed talk about a few more bikkies in the bikkie tin
4475818 when it did become successful i soon realised there wasnt going to be anything forthcoming
4475819 today is life the only life you are sure of make the most of today get interested in something shake yourself awake develop a hobby let the winds of enthusiasm sweep through you live today with gusto
4475820 treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being
4475821 when a person really desires something all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream
4475822 they say im crazy but i have a good time im just looking for clues at the scene of the crime lifes been good to me so far
4475823 life loves to be taken by the lapel and told im with you kid lets go maya angelou
4475824 thomas jefferson once said we should never judge a president by his age only by his works and ever since he told me that i stopped worrying
4475825 titus andronicus has a lot of humour its outrageous sick and its in shakespeare its in the writing its black comedy at the source the line between tragedy and black comedy is very blurred
4475826 theres black humour in king lear macbeth hamlet in all of shakespeare whether it goes into farce or comedy were too often denied that but in fact its there in the writing of course its more blatant in titus andronicus its more basic its right out there
4475827 its very contemporary and yet his commentary is written in a very shakespearean style its very hard to tell sometimes where muller stops and shakespeare begins but other times its unmistakable because muller mentions hots dogs or football or here come the tanks
4475828 muller is very unspecific if you look at the script theres no punctuation for a start there are some odd stage directions but you are free to do whatever you want with it something like hamletmachine is only eight pages long but it can run for four hours depending on whos directing it
4475829 the play is all about the world we live in there are certain references to the nazi era because i think muller was still coming to terms as most of germany still is with what happened
4475830 it reflects quite fully the horrors of the holocaust and since then events such as the massacres in rwanda
4475831 it doesnt pull any punches its just the way the world is whether you like it or not so the collapse of ancient rome and the collapse of germany to the nazi era are parallels
4475832 i think having a male cast gives it an extra kind of energy and brutality in a way there are no soft edges anywhere its pretty tough minded
4475833 its just one more rejection of reality were just actors doing this play there are no costumes no set were not impersonating not characterising not dressing up theres no reference to us trying to be ancient romans elizabethans or nazis its non specific and the audience is free to relocate us wherever they want
4475834 weve done nearly all the shakespeare repertoire now some four or five times we just thought we cant go on repeating ourselves
4475835 weve tried to find plays that are in some way connected to shakespeare like goldonis the servant of two masters comedia dellarte was very much the inspiration for shakespeares comedy so the more you understand goldoni the more you see where shakespeares comedy was coming from
4475836 shakespeare was subsidising new australian writing in a big way
4475837 weve been doing it now for so long that its become part of our theatrical consciousness
4475838 it seems quite normal now that actors use their own australian accents
4475839 we use modern dress we dont try to imitate the english way of doing it or any other way we make our own way and i think its generally accepted
4475840 you might find a few punters or critics who might say thats not authentic shakespeare we want the english accents we want the period costumes we want the shakespearean style whatever they imagine that is but i think theres no such thing
4475841 it has to somehow reflect what is perceived as our national characteristics and that is again perception rather than reality
4475842 but i think an outsider might say australians are more comic perhaps ironic suspicious of class distinctions a bit sardonic about authority and dogma that we have a bit of a reputation for being sceptical about those things more of an insistence on male bonding and camaraderie a gender conflict that is different to what you might find in an english or american production a lot of those things outsiders might say are typically australian i think its important to let them be rather than denying them
4475843 i think generally speaking our artists and sporting people have a youthful energy about the work or the approach and maybe thats because were uncluttered with traditions and expectations and we dont have that burden of history or tradition that sometimes can be a weight around the neck in england or europe
4475844 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4475845 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4475846 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4475847 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4475848 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4475849 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4475850 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4475851 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4475852 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4475853 the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
4475854 dream your dreams with open eyes and make them come true

4475869 banks should have to get their customers affirmative consent before signing them up for their most expensive loans
4475870 ive been working on reducing sky high overdraft fees for several years now
4475871 overdraft loans can be useful financial tools but many consumers are being enrolled in costly overdraft protection programs without their consent
4475872 in most cases banking customers can avoid overdrafting their accounts and paying any associated fee by knowing their balances
4475873 they can call pnc and we will automatically exclude them from the convenience of overdraft access for all atm transactions and purchases
4475874 i have the same goal ive had ever since i was a girl i want to rule the world
4475875 i sometimes think i was born to live up to my name how could i be anything else but what i am having been named madonna i would either have ended up a nun or this
4475876 im tough ambitious and i know exactly what i want if that makes me a bitch okay
4475877 a lot of people are afraid to say what they want thats why they dont get what they want
4475878 i stand for freedom of expression doing what you believe in and going after your dreams

4475884 thomas jefferson once said we should never judge a president by his age only by his works and ever since he told me that i stopped worrying
4475885 i was an adventurous kid so i tried the sport out with a view to trying the whitewater rapids in the rivers south of perth
4475886 dad and i started on the avon river and had no clue what we were doing
4475887 he wanted the degree first and no canoeing but when i got picked for my first olympic team he jumped on the bandwagon
4475888 i am just one of many in australia who struggle financially
4475889 a lot of athletes just dont get enough money i am ok but simply cant afford to do things like my mates are doing now i cant buy a house or go on holidays
4475890 if she has two hours of not doing something she tries to make me do more she makes me look lazy
4475891 well say no more today about the way sonny bill got on with the bulldogs or about the way the club was managed from the inside because negotiations are under way
4475892 we are hoping for a positive issue because if not there are a lot of things that can come out into the open and have very bad consequences for the bulldogs and nrl
4475893 the bulldogs have been honest open and transparent in these discussions with sonny bill williams and his management
4475894 its not ideal but the big issue for us was obtaining the injunction and the fact that he complied with it by not playing then entering into negotiations with the bulldogs
4475895 its a substantial sum but it was never going to finish completely satisfactorily
4475896 walking out mid contract is still a shock to most people in the game
4475897 it was either going to be three months or six weeks depending on the extent of the tear so it was the six week option thankfully
4475898 i would ideally like to be ready to go against new zealand in november but obviously there is a lot to happen until then i will be back into rehab on monday with the waratahs
4475899 i have had injuries before and i took them a lot worse than i took this one i have been through the whole six months out twice before with an ankle and a foot
4475900 i suppose the experience of those injuries helps with this situation ive dealt with it well
4475901 my contract starts in january next year with grenoble i am hopeful to be part of the end of season tour while i am here i want to be playing every game i can
4475902 i never wanted to take that role that i am here to sit on the bench and guide burgo through his test career
4475903 i am very open to helping burgo out in any situation but i think the best way i can help him is by being as competitive as i can
4475904 hes all right at the moment but not quite 100 per cent
4475905 these things take a bit of time you need to wait for the bruising to come out
4475906 i think hes pretty well but maybe im not quite as chirpy as i have been
4475907 i cant see kibbutz beating the other two weekend hussler light fantastic not over 1400m at weight for age
4475908 im expecting kibbutz to run a solid race and i will be looking for him to hit the line hard doing his best work at the finish
4475909 but its hard to tip against weekend hussler hes a bit of a freak and i think he will beat light fantastic
4475910 my gut feeling is hell run well but get beat
4475911 but hes the best ive had and nothing would surprise
4475912 i need to be confident of beating weekend hussler or im wasting my time the other horse has the score on the board and we have the potential but you cant eat potential
4475913 that is just not going to happen darren wont be able to lead and dictate like he did on mentality at canterbury
4475914 but will i lead on triple honour i honestly dont know
4475915 the horse has led and won before so i wont have a problem leading early but it will all depend on the race tempo
4475916 put it this way im going to be in the first five from the jump seriously my main objective is to ensure triple honour settles and relaxes early
4475917 he has had a good preparation and is proven at weight for age
4475918 he ran second behind apache cat first up last time and did beat takeover target home id say takeover target would be a short priced favourite in this
4475919 theres been a certain amount of pop sociology in america that the shia cant get along with the sunni and the shia in iraq just want to establish some kind of islamic fundamentalist regime theres almost no evidence of that at all iraqs always been very secular
4475920 i think well be vindicated when we discover the weapons of mass destruction and when we liberate the people of iraq
4475921 lots of mothers dont know what to feed their children anymore
4475922 in the past it was good to be a bit fat because it was a sign of strength but now children are getting too fat
4475923 he was playing for sydney olympic last weekend against bankstown in the tiger turf cup final
4475924 hes got two fantastic feet and is exceptional on set pieces
4475925 hes a very laconic sort of character you dont get much out of him in terms of vocal input but i think his football will speak for itself
4475926 i am ok i have been given a job to do so i will do it to the best i can
4475927 i have been told where i am playing but i will keep that to myself if i do the job well then i will tell everyone about it later
4475928 while it is disappointing not to have ricky ponting available we are confident continuing his recovery and missing this series will assure ricky is ready for the demanding cricket schedule ahead for the australian team
4475929 matthew hayden has been selected in this side subject to fitness his progress has been monitored closely by our physiotherapist and doctor and his overall participation in the series will be determined as we get closer to the date
4475930 he is on track to be available for upcoming cricket
4475931 matthew hayden is progressing well with his rehabilitation following an achilles tendon injury his availability for the series will be determined in the next two weeks
4475932 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4475933 weve grown through it and learned to trust god and do the right thing
4475934 life is a test we really have tried to live out our faith what we teach at church and that is love your enemies do the right thing when the wrong things happen have a good attitude even when things arent going well
4475935 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4475936 if the truth is so apparent and the truth stands firm then why would god withhold the truth of the situation involving caylee anthony from the world
4475937 he who stands firm to the end will be saved
4475938 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god

4475942 i dont think anybodys being tight with the money were trying to spend it maybe the gulf between the championship and the premier league is so huge you have to take a big gulp
4475943 we like to play a balance of two really rather than two out and out strikers wed like to have a striker whose natural game is to drop in and play but also be pressing the ball high up the pitch but at this moment we dont have that type of player
4475944 everyone is entitled to their opinion but we just need to stay concentrated on what were trying to achieve if we sign better players then i expect to evolve to the next level
4475945 at the end of it all it comes down the players
4475946 they have their own reasons their own responsibilities and their own outlook on life its not for me to tell them what to do and what not to do lots of players have big egos and others may not be willing to put their necks on the line therere other situations where players are very comfortable at clubs even if theyre not playing

4475979 more and more children are taking to the streets some to engage in petty trade while others are just there in search of food
4475980 i am on the streets daily to sell sweet potatoes due to the poor condition and hunger of my family i have no other choice my mother prepares this food in the house and i sell it in the market
4475981 similar assessments are also currently underway in bay benadir middle shabelle galgaduud and lower shabelle
4475982 the increase in children living or working on the street has also been reported by the benadir child protection network no figures are stated
4475983 among other essential protection issues for children the assessments will provide insight into the scale of the problem as such unicef is not in a position to comment on figures at this stage the assessments will be completed by this coming sunday in the field and will then be analysed
4475984 but we do support programmes that monitor the violations against children that provide psycho social care and support to children for example in afgoye through schools as well as community mobilisation programmes to highlight child protection issues at community level
4475985 this may very well include children living or working on the street
4475986 it is important to keep in mind that the au is pursuing a policy of stabilization of somalia and to achieve that objective we are bringing together the transitional federal government and the opposition i must say that the current prime minister of somalia nur hassan hussein has been very focused on talking to the opposition essentially the alliance for the reliberation of somalia ars and the alliance has also been very positive so we have jointly with the united nations facilitated the dialogue towards reconciliation between the tfg transitional federal government and the ars and this has led to the djibouti agreement
4475987 i think the two parties to the djibouti agreement are fully committed there is a high level political meeting and the security committee is meeting at a very high level in djibouti this weekend so there is a commitment and i would lead the au delegation so once we have launched this committee we hope that both the government and the ars will go in somalia and to galvanize the somali population i can tell you that when i was in somalias capital mogadishu i met with the civil society elders members of the cabinet and they are all for the total implementation of the djibouti agreement and i dont have any doubt that we are going to move forward
4475988 there is no rift as such there is only the difference in the interpretation on how the provisions of the constitution should be implemented i dont think there was a disagreement on the dismissal of the mayor of mogadishu what was the disagreement was how the process was conducted

4476004 for anyone who wonders whether any of todays architects could influence a city to the same extent a trip to edinburgh in this festival season would be instructive in this place of architectural marvels there is a new name to conjure with the successor to adam playfair hamilton bryce and gilbert scott the creators of edinburghs celebrated skyline is allan murray his may not be a name to conjure with in the wider architectural world but in terms of current projects and masterplans in this city he dwarfs everything that his more famous predecessors constructed
4476005 it is hard to take a walk from the narrow wynds of the 17th century old town to the stern splendour of the 18th century new town without stumbling across a murray site either completed in construction or in contemplation
4476006 a striking feature of the coverage was the ability of pundits who have enthusiastically advocated for u s invasions of sovereign countries dismissing concerns that these would violate international law to demand that russia be punished for breaking the same law by violating georgia sovereignty
4476007 these commentators seemed blissfully unaware of the contradiction as when new york times columnist william kristol wrote 8 11 08 that in iraq we and our iraqui allies are on the verge of a strategic victory over the jihadists citing this as evidence that 2008 was an auspicious year for freedom and democracy while two paragraphs later condemning the fact that russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border

4476217 i prepared keeping in mind the conditions in sri lanka the targets of the team and its nice that i succeeded immediately

4476228 desde hace 15 a os no logramos solucionar ese conflicto en el nivel pol tico pero tampoco podemos esperar otros 15 a os para encontrar una soluci n eficaz
4476229 south african writers have long been masters at balancing the political and the personal in their narratives
4476230 nadie rechaza el principio de integridad territorial como uno de los b sicos del derecho internacional
4476231 lamentablemente despu s de lo sucedido es poco probable que los osetas y los abjasios puedan vivir en un estado con los georgianos para lograrlo deber an emprenderse unos esfuerzos tit nicos para zanjar ese conflicto

4476244 he had a lot of things that would catch a coachs eye his body type was perfect for swimming
4476245 the thing that really struck me was that he was so competitive in everything he did whether he was playing a game on the playground or whether he was swimming in a meet
4476246 clearly were very close and we have a very complicated and very special relationship
4476247 while we know everything about each other and weve been together so long we still have to maintain that business relationship in the pool its hard to manage sometimes

4476249 i think he may be getting a little tired but hes only got two more races left so hell be ready

4476388 people are already struggling to keep on top of mortgage repayments and rent rises but this pay offer will see our members suffer a huge cut in their living standards

4476407 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4476408 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4476409 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4476410 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct

4476432 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4476524 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view it is for the people of pakistan to decide but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pak afghan border but clearly on our side of the border too
4476525 i condemn this act of human rights violation there is no doubt that every pakistani is with their brothers and sisters in kashmir on this occasion i have no doubt that kashmir beats in the heart of every pakistani and that kashmir runs through pakistans veins therefore every pakistani is with the people of kashmir

4476532 inzamam himself does not enjoy a good reputation as a captain as he made certain questionable decisions to taint the image of the country besides exhibiting his
4476533 the biggest mistake made by inzamam as a captain was the forfeiting of the oval test in august 2006 which caused a lot of confusion and problems for pakistan cricket at highest level of the game then he inzamam imposed his will on selectors by including injured pacer shabbir ahmad on the tour of south africa in 2006 and even threatened to come back from the same tour

4476537 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4476538 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks

4476583 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
4476584 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
4476585 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
4476586 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
4476587 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
4476588 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress

4476594 we want to try and get away from the nil points mark as soon as possible and there is no better place to start than against the team that finished third last season
4476595 a few years ago teams may have went to fir park and thought that it would be okay to go and attack them but there is a different respect now
4476596 they were deservedly third last season they have got a lot of good young players and there is no reason why they cant sustain the success they had last season

4476612 every interaction an enterprise has with customers partners or suppliers instigates a new trail of data which over a short period of time can create a deluge effect experts predict that within a few years it wont be uncommon to see enterprises with networks and databases storing over 100 tb terabytes of information one key area that has contributed to this data explosion is the continued global surge of online transactions this unprecedented growth is driving demand for better collaboration with back office systems within organizations it integrators have begun converging key systems such as enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management with traditional e commerce
4476613 many of the technologies and trends service oriented architecture business process management mobile technology and web 2 0 and enterprise data management are well known but what caught my eye was the x internet discussion the x internet term refers to connecting physical objects to the internet via rfid and sensors in theory the x internet will create new business processes and remote monitoring and control of physical assets just an aside it almost sounds like the beginning of cybernet from the terminator series but i digress
4476614 conducted by the economist intelligence unit london and sponsored by cisco systems the survey also revealed that improving it responsiveness to new business requirements was the top it objective for 57 percent of the companies of the companies that have completed a transformation 43 percent said that cost savings were the top benefit they realized another 40 percent reported smoother more flexible operations
4476615 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
4476616 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4476617 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
4476618 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen

4476621 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4476622 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4476623 not only are we going to have a relatively small workforce but also one thats more diverse
4476624 we need to become very concerned about getting the proper education track for those in the pipeline
4476625 although as youve probably read our organization american media is under the gun they have nevertheless devoted really big money to this
4476626 the enormous amounts we know edwards is spending to keep it contained
4476627 in those days we mostly played against other schools from usakos omaruru and the rhenisch nama school from windhoek but our school was very strong and always came out tops in many of our encounters against these teams
4476628 we were just playing friendlies around town against spoilers and magic tigers
4476629 when i arrived at flames in 1972 i found myself in the company of my hometown buddy oscar
4476630 we were unbeatable and i will never forget that historic day when we beat african stars hands down in the final of the now defunct herero cup at otjiwarongo in 1972 with gotty and kauru on song on that particular day
4476631 that was a good move because it came at a time when the teams old guard started to phase out for a new generation i remember very well the day when we played black africa in the final of the first ever sponsored tournament with a staggering amount of n 1000 which was a lot of money at the time

4476715 ive been here for the past two months before i was delivered of the baby today since i have been here ive never been taken to the hospital since nobody visits the hospital here i only mix and interact with other people around most people whose cases have been described as precarious or difficult by the hospitals are all here we all eat from a common pot and today when i noticed the signs of labour i called mama hajia raliat who followed me into the room with ease i gave birth to the twins

4476862 last season we had a staggered start tevez and anderson joined us and werent 100 percent fit ronaldo got suspended for three games after the first game then rooney got injured in the first match against reading and was out for three games
4476863 by the time we got everyone focused and fit we then went on a fantastic run with our consistency and really good football
4476864 id prefer to get a good start we want that but we are also able to go the long distance
4476865 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones a bit
4476866 but the backbone is with the midfield players and defenders and there is good variety there
4476867 hopefully that is enough to get us through the first game against newcastle which is always a good exciting game they will always have a go newcastle
4476868 we need to start well and get off to a flyer and just keep winning

4476873 unfortunately they did not perform in the way we needed last night
4476874 but we will see an improvement at the weekend we need to step up to the plate and become more dynamic it is important we show a bit more quality on the ball with the right pass at the right time

4476887 in this case i want to be clear since i talked with martin oneill in april i didnt talk with anyone else at aston villa all the talks have been between rick parry and the owner and chief executive of aston villa and they have been pretty good

4476914 well i guess if anybody would know whats not in the fundamental interest of newfoundland and labrador its stephen harper because he reneged on his promise and he worked against our interest by breaking a 10 billion promise
4476915 this election is not going to be decided strictly on green shift people have to stand back and say ok fine what do we get from stephen harper and the conservatives theyve cut back on funding for volunteers and minority groups and legal rights
4476916 from a green shift perspective as well newfoundland and labrador is just basically waiting to see where all the cards are going to fall here
4476917 its just one more thing that slipped out of his mouth that hes going to regret saying
4476918 if i were to send keesha to the jury this week shed be extremely mad at me because shes counting on my vote to keep her here
4476919 on the other hand if libra were to stay in the game that would benefit me tremendously because that leaves an enormous target in the game an enormous target who has no interest in coming after me
4476920 this has been a crazy game its a game of power struggles and each week it changes on a dime i definitely stand proud and tall with the way that i went last week i feel as though each week changes and each time something different happens in the game you have to think for yourself
4476921 so hopefully if i am evicted or not either way it goes you guys start thinking about the game and that youve got to play it for yourself at some point have fun its a game
4476922 were a bunch of women were all around the same age we have a lot of the same ideas about things very a type personalities dominant a little bit

4476924 they gave me a lot of credit i deserve some of it but not all of it
4476925 there are a lot of votes that lead up to evictions in the house and to just put it on one vote i was starting to call myself the puppet mistress i did do my dirt and it did catch up with me but at the same time it was fun doing it i had a lot of fun doing it
4476926 you leave your family because you want to hopefully win 500 000 you leave your family to do something for your family its one of those things that i figured if i were the winner of big brother than it would definitely help us in the long run for me it was about the challenge as well the challenge of going outside of the norm for me
4476927 its all about be yourself and that were all equal
4476928 i really enjoy interacting with the audience i want people to have a good time at my shows

4476931 what i really seriously wanted to be was a film actress that was my big aspiration i went into college for acting and had all these scholarships for it but i got a record deal and that took me off the acting track for many years

4476971 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4476972 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4476973 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4476974 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4476975 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4476976 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care
4476977 we do remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement thats both fair and equitable providing that union leadership is reasonable and realistic in its approach
4476978 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4476979 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4476980 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4476981 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4476982 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4476983 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4476984 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4476985 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4476986 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4476987 my great thanks to anne at just muttering for her very kind congratulatory post from my best wishes to her

4476999 why the heck is my party in so much trouble
4477000 it was probably a mistake to require seat belts on school buses
4477001 its extremely expensive and there is no evidence it would significantly save lives or reduce injuries
4477002 i will fight tooth and nail to make my colleagues understand how important this is
4477003 naf jobber aktivt som p driver i lokalmilj et for legge til rette for en trygg skolevei og at det etableres gode gang og sykkelveier gode p og avstigningslommer og gode kollektivl sninger til og fra skolen
4477004 a lot of these courses are ones that the kids selected and that they told us they would like to see the teachers come up with some of the ideas too we review the ideas and if we can do it we offer the class
4477005 most of our teachers are teachers in the district or are people who have grown up in the district and attended summer school here
4477006 he was always joking around in our office that he had a new trick to show us so i told him to go and get his substitute certification and to come back and teach a magic class
4477007 magic is a passion of mine and magic tricks are something that is disappearing as time goes by
4477008 i want to keep these secrets alive and the kids love learning how to do some of these tricks
4477009 and the kids love it too every day they want to know how a tricks are done and we watch dvds that show how some of the classic stage illusions are done
4477010 you bring your own camera and they go around taking pictures of nature and of things in and around the school and you learn how to use the different modes of the camera and how to use photoshop and things like that
4477011 its a lot of fun and ive learned a lot
4477012 i didnt know how to do anything on this camera i had barely used a camera before but i wanted to find out how to get better photos
4477013 i have been really interested in taking pictures but i didnt really understand my camera
4477014 i wanted to learn more about it because my pictures were always blurry now i know how to take good pictures and how to use the settings on my camera
4477015 i have learned how to be responsible and how to act towards adults and children to children you must be kind but when they go crazy and have bad behavior you must make sure they stop while still trying to be kind

4477018 el tanto anotado por el chileno renato ramos en los minutos de descuento dej a bol var a dos goles de anotarse en la siguiente ronda de la copa sudamericana pese a caer derrotado 4 2 ayer ante la liga deportiva universitaria de quito lduq en el encuentro que se jug en el estadio casa blanca
4477019 los celestes perdieron en ecuador y ahora est n obligados a ganar por 2 0 si quieren continuar en la cita internacional
4477020 el gol del chileno renato ramos cuando el partido conclu a sirvi como un b lsamo para aplacar las duras cr ticas contra el plantel dirigido por el argentino jorge carlos habberger porque material humano posee lo que no tienen es un equipo una idea un funcionamiento
4477021 el f tbol lateralizado como intenci n de quemar minutos congelar el esf rico matar la iniciativa contraria no siempre funcionan teniendo al frente un equipo dise ado y que adem s tiene s lidos conceptos futbol sticos es poco probable que con esta propuesta tan miserable se pretenda hacerle frente al campe n de am rica y peor a n intentar ganarle
4477022 las acciones del encuentro fueron dominadas por el cuadro local que tuvo en el volante de creaci n dami n manso a su principal figura adem s del aporte valioso de los laterales neicer reasco por derecha y pa l ambrossi por izquierda
4477023 la defensa de la academia tuvo demasiados problemas para contener el ataque ecuatoriano y cedi demasiados espacios tanto por los costados como por el centro
4477024 un penal dudoso que fue cambiado por gol y un tanto el cuarto en posici n adelantada le estaban dando a liga deportiva universitaria de quito un triunfo por goleada de 4 1 complicando el negocio de bol var en ecuador pero la anotaci n de ramos en los descuentos para establecer el 4 2 final devolvi a los celestes una parte de la esperanza que parec a perdida en su debut en la s ptima edici n de la copa sudamericana
4477025 los errores del rbitro y sus asistentes en esas dos jugadas tan determinantes que favorecieron a liga y que pusieron el cotejo 4 1 para los locales no suponen sin embargo que la victoria de liga sea injusta porque m s all de cierto equilibrio que hubo en la primera parte en la segunda el ecuatoriano fue superior en lo f sico y futbol stico y el resultado pudo ser m s amplio del que se anot en quito
4477026 i was staying over at my boyfriends place i said id make us coffee but i couldnt figure out how to use his co
4477027 then he and donivan played leaving louisiana in the broad daylight which hadnt been recorded yet
4477028 emmy and i sang duets at waylons house for an hour
4477029 and rosanne was over in the corner next to susanna clark i would be disingenuous if i didnt admit that the famous family johnny cash and june carter wasnt a flame to the moth i was a big time fan of both of them and i was a young man drawn to that fame it was something rosanne and her sisters had to deal with all of their lives that was a subtle part of it but i also became captivated by her susanna noticed and said heres her phone number call her so i did
4477030 but i cant begin to explain how shy i was i was a bit overweight and didnt want people to see me but carlene was going to waylons party and she invited me to come along i was living with my dad in hendersonville and i tried on everything i owned but nothing looked good i was so depressed that i said no im not going they walked out the door without me and i opened the door and yelled at them hold on im going to come i just knew that for some reason i had to go
4477031 i went to germany to stay with a girl friend renata damm who worked with ariola records
4477032 i was following her around to all her meetings and christmas parties and these guys at ariola said wed like to hear a demo from you they were interested because i was johnny cashs daughter i figured no one in america will hear it so what the hell i might as well do it
4477033 and recorded three or four tracks thats when we started flirting our relationship was born out of our working somehow we got work and romance tangled into one thing we never were able to separate the two thats one reason we eventually separated if we werent working together what were we doing
4477034 i remember telling my dad when i was 18 on the road with him
4477035 i dont want to be somebodys little wife sitting at home i want to do something he was totally surprised he was shocked that i had any guts im glad to be rodneys little wife but only because he doesnt try to make me do anything that i dont want to do he encourages me to fulfill my potential i love being married its not what i thought it was i thought it would be real stifling real boring but its not its wonderful the companionship the exchange of information
4477036 we went into her dads studio and tried a few tunes
4477037 and her natural talent rose to the occasion i started to believe in her and started to collaborate with her and push her she was very shy but in an innocent way i said try this do this it caught on and she began to grow i had never even thought about producing i joked you just used that as a ploy to get next to me but once i did it i enjoyed the work
4477038 he wanted me to record these jerk off songs i said no disco shit there was one song he wanted me to do and i said i am not going to do that song i hate it he had the musicians come in and cut a track on it but i said no way am i going to sing that song he said this song is going to be a big hit for someone i said fine for someone else not me after we finished my album he put his own voice on the tracks and had a number one hit in germany
4477039 of course he had to sing very high because the tracks were cut for me
4477040 i like how innocent i was but at the time i was so depressed i couldnt get out of bed i couldnt stop crying i saw how you could be manipulated into expressing something that wasnt you and i found that humiliating i told myself its going to be released just in europe no ones going to talk about my dad i can experiment and no one will know how it turns out i was thinking of myself as a european at that point i wasnt planning to go back i had an affair with an israeli pop singer then rodney called me in munich on my 23rd birthday
4477041 rodney and i started writing letters when i was in germany
4477042 he was recording his first album and was having a real hard time he was separating from his wife he had his little girl by himself and he had no money whatsoever he had to take the baby to the studio and put her in a playpen i was in love with him before that but i wouldnt admit it to him i called up my mother and i was crying i told her im so in love with this guy and hes married what am i going to do and my mother said you cant do anything you have to forget about him so i tried to i didnt make any advances to him until i was in germany and i started writing to him
4477043 i said yeah do you want brian to produce it i said yeah do you want me to represent you i said yeah it was that simple i had just been playing dodger stadium with emmy in front of elton john and i said ill do that ill make a record and have hits like emmy it was pretty jarring when it didnt happen that way
4477044 in this modern world were livin in the rules aint like theyve ever been
4477045 he slipped the handcuffs on behind my back then he left me freezing on a steel rail track
4477046 i had been writing folkie balladeer things but when i got to california i started writing differently
4477047 one of the first songs to come out of it was aint living long like this i was part of a rhythm section in a band so some of the things i wrote for a good while became more rhythmic given that that was my daily musical input the language and the melody were still just as important but the rhythm got underneath and became a part of it the chord changes though very simple were more designed to be played by a group of musicians its not what you would call a troubadour song its one of my songs most performed live by other bands just a good four to the bar rocknroll song
4477048 i know for a fact that it was the source we went straight for the art of elvira as opposed to the commerciality i was much more interested in exploring the song and finding some source of soul in there whereas making a hit record wasnt the first thing that came to mind
4477049 when my first record came out i ran off to germany with rosanne
4477050 i got back to l a on the day of carlenes record release party
4477051 after a long awful flight from munich i was exhausted from customs and when i got to the apartment i was sharing with rosey she wasnt there i didnt have a key so i broke a window let myself in took a shower changed and went to the party at the magic shop when i walked in rodney was sitting by the door i sat down next to him and didnt move the whole night he was no longer married and we were together from that moment on he started asking me to marry him hed ask me every day i never said no but i didnt think he was serious but i finally said yes and we got married in april
4477052 but i was kind of resentful of you i thought that you were given a chance to make records because you were johnny cashs daughter
4477053 but i didnt think you had paid your dues enough to make a record you had never slugged it out and if your closest friend and lover was judging you that way just imagine how other people were
4477054 theres no formal schedule of dues paying either i just paid them in other ways
4477055 when rick decided to sign me i said why not
4477056 everyone i knew was making records emmylou harris karen brooks carlene and rodney
4477057 i guess songwriters are making records now so thats what ill do i wanted to be part of that group but to do that i had to come out of my shell so i stopped being the shy plump girl and became the cute girl
4477058 even today im not a real good guitar player so if i play on my albums its for the personality of it it can be kind of sweet if im playing and singing at the same time for a long time i wanted to be good on the guitar now ive gotten to the point where i can accompany myself and write songs on the guitar
4477059 i didnt know what the hell i was doing and rodney didnt have a much better idea all i knew was go for the emotions and thats all i did we both have pretty good ears for songs we recorded a song called the winding stream a beautiful old carter family song but we decided not to go in that direction because it was too hippie
4477060 it was during the making of that album that we stopped being hippies
4477061 brian created a style in southern music the fusion of rock and country
4477062 when i started making records with rosanne it was an extension of that we recorded those records in the enactron truck with the same team of people only with me guiding it the fact that emmylous records became commercial and artistically successful at the same time stemmed from the fact that we didnt look at it commercially at all when i started working with rosanne we took the same approach
4477063 i was pretending to be a singer i knew i didnt have the real live ability i had no sense of my voice or how to place it or how to get around its limitations i was at the mercy of my voice if it was working a little bit i was really happy if it wasnt i didnt know what to do i had a gut feeling about what i wanted and i just found it by feel
4477064 she had inherited a tone in her voice from her father hers is real sweet when she doesnt sing too hard it has her fathers resonance when shes in a comfortable musical environment thats a real cool sounding voice i started to believe in her and started to collaborate with her and push her she was very shy but in an innocent way i said try this do this it caught on and she began to grow in confidence
4477065 i never would have done half the things ive done without rodney
4477066 he had so much more confidence in me than i had he had an unshakeable faith in me so many times i felt i cant do this i should do something else i should just stay home but he was unfaltering in his faith if for nothing else ill owe him for that for the rest of my life
4477067 she wrote a song called this has happened before played it for me and i was stunned
4477068 she possessed a kind of melancholy some of that lennonesque melancholy like youve got to hide your love away
4477069 i asked him not long ago i said if i had been you i would have had severe reservations about marrying me
4477070 and he said well i did at first just because my family is so intense they all are all of them i cant explain to you how intense all of the back and forth is the little things that go on and he said yeah and you know he separated me from that
4477071 besides we were really in love when you marry and have you own family that naturally helps you get a distance from it i dont need to be enmeshed in all the goings on of my sisters and my parents i have to put that energy into my kids we really make a conscious effort to stay out of it you cant lead their lives for them
4477072 and they said this is a country record i said no its a pop record like the eagles or the byrds i know what country music is and this isnt it i thought i was signed to columbia not columbia nashville
4477073 i thought my songs would go straight to the top of the charts emmy had been so successful that we thought wed all be that successful we were shocked when rodneys first album flopped
4477074 maybe for an hour id want to be a woman and feel that phantom power
4477075 under the right scenarios csp could meet a significant portion of todays energy needs
4477076 i love all kinds of art and i love music i enjoy rap hip hop reggae reggaeton and soul music i have to listen to it everywhere i go i draw and paint too but i dont have much time for that im into computers and sometimes if i have a little time i like to play computer games i like to watch the simpsons and south park on tv my life has become very busy since i started to model for score people ask me how i became a score model i discovered score when i answered their website beascoremodel com

4477101 for city life and the jpndc affordable housing advocacy is the core of their work we are partners on current and past projects and we will continue to actively support affordable housing
4477102 i think that it would be dangerous for us to join an advocacy group it could jeopardize our role in zoning and design review
4477103 other folks helping us promote the position of the jpnc
4477104 the main goal is for any proposal is to be based on what the community wants
4477105 we want development to enhance the community not create an exclusive part of the neighborhood with benefits just for a few
4477106 feel like the affordable housing advocacy is as much about business as it is about housing
4477107 people who are board members of community development corporations who also live in the community
4477108 not a big deal no one should be out of the room
4477109 once we are involved in applying for something we would not be involved
4477110 our role and this is something we have been doing for 30 years is to get as many people as possible involved in the conversation it is an emphasis of ours to attract people who tend to be less active and involved
4477111 i think that the role of the housing and development committee has been very strong in the whole process it has been strong in insuring community participation and promoting the jpnc affordable housing guidelines

4477120 whats this oh just a little something i picked up from my
4477121 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4477122 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4477123 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4477124 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4477125 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4477126 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today

4477129 it would appear our market here in australia is prepared to pay a premium price for this sort of narcotic
4477130 what we have to do is to treat demand as much as we deal with supply

4477142 the mocker certainly displays very wonderful powers of mimicry and self training
4477143 publishing detailed accounts of the singing of individual birds was the kind of thing that early 20th century ornithologists did but that kind of ornithology has unfortunately long since gone out of fashion
4477144 it has increased since the first season of his singing he has developed into a mocker exclusively not seeming to sing at all the song of his own species
4477145 if so he is a most philosophical bird and merits admiration for his resourcefulness as well as his great achievements
4477146 more than locally celebrated songster whose reputation for vocal ability promises to rival that of any bird of this race yet recorded
4477147 he seemed to like the constantly varying companionship of the passing cars with their occupants who however knew nothing of the mockers presence in their rapid passing by

4477152 how do i feel about it i obviously feel like its long overdue i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4477153 that many of the repetitive motifs that coalesced into the genre of science fiction represent ideological ways of grasping the social consequences of colonialism including the fantastic appropriation and rationalization of unevenly distributed colonial wealth in the homeland and in the colonies the racist ideologies that enabled colonial exploitation and the cognitive impact of radical cultural differences on the home culture

4477157 la migraci n de productores de tabaco a otros cultivos va a continuar hasta desaparecer
4477158 durante mucho tiempo el tabaco burley misionero no ha sido reconocido con precios satisfactorios para el productor este a o se avanz en algo con el precio pero est lejos de ser el que verdaderamente le corresponder a recibir al que produce un tabaco de excelente calidad reconocido internacionalmente como uno de los mejores cumpliendo con todos los requerimientos de los compradores llevando adelante programas de buenas pr cticas agr colas utilizando insumos que le solicitan nuestro productor fue un adelantado en la eliminaci n del bromuro de metilo est reduciendo el consumo de agroqu micos a trav s de un programa manejo integrado de plagas y enfermedades que es nico a nivel mundial

4477164 uno de los detenidos siempre estuvo apoyando las carreras de autos e incluso nosotros apoy bamos la parte log stica de ese tipo de eventos pero de alguna manera no nos sorprendi demasiado porque ven a corriendo el rumor y los vecinos hac an comentarios en la calle de manera informal yo hab a los hab a escuchado pero siempre estaba involucrado con mi funci n nada m s por eso creo que el hecho no sorprendi sino que fue una confirmaci n de lo que se hablaba

4477198 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more

4477203 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4477204 at the end of the day what it means is that workers are going to be priced out of health care

4477213 hpp diperlukan supaya perbankan mampu menghitung rata rata kebutuhan dana untuk melakukan investasi di minyak nilam kita targetkan tahun ini akan selesai
4477214 pada tahun ini kami perkirakan nilainya akan meningkat 20 persen menjadi usd120 juta per tahun
4477215 kita sudah mengajukan kepada pemerintah tetapi keputusannya seperti apa kita tunggu
4477216 belanja untuk kepentingan kementerian pusat sendiri nilainya mencapai lebih dari rp300 triliun sementara belanja untuk keperluan daerah memang juga sekira rp300 triliun tetapi jumlahnya masih jauh lebih kecil
4477217 seharusnya pemerintah memiliki keberanian yang radikal agar belanja itu lebih diperuntukkan ke daerah karena negara kita ini lebih luas ketimbang jakarta dan itu memang konsekuensinya harus semakin mengurangi birokrasi di pusat desentralisasi dan otonomi harus berjalan dengan sukses
4477218 tingginya produksi rumput laut ini juga berpengaruh terhadap ekspor ke sejumlah negara seperti china dan jepang
4477219 harga per kilogram rumput laut mencapai rp19 ribu dan kami berharap harga ini akan terus meningkat sampai akhir tahun

4477230 we dont have a specific intent to develop the property other than to further the goals of the depot district project area
4477231 they are broadly to encourage transit oriented development and to foster the creation of a medium density urban neighborhood with a wide mixture of land uses
4477232 their thinking was that the hotels would be medium rise structures but also around the base the buildings would include a wide array of retail shops that provides guests as well as travelers and visitors easy access to a pretty good selection of retail goods and services
4477233 the catalyst fund meets an important need in the community development field
4477234 it will look beyond real estate and housing development to finance organizations expanding their innovative activities in sectors such as workforce development education and access to healthy foods among others financing for these activities often is difficult for organizations to obtain
4477235 the living cities catalyst fund will play a key sector building role
4477236 many foundations are exploring the use of pris to advance their agendas the fund is an excellent vehicle for new pri makers enabling them to invest alongside the institutions that pioneered these investments and create a pri portfolio without having to build specialized staff to underwrite and monitor individual investments
4477237 living cities is about making markets work for underserved urban communities and their residents the fund will bring new capital to cities by providing a convenient vehicle for philanthropic investors who care about cities and in turn enabling organizations to expand their impact on the ground and leverage additional investment
4477238 it is simply not right for the city council to seize private property by eminent domain and give it to another so that they can profit
4477239 if the city did its homework they would not approve a plan to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to benefit an organization that tried to swindle taxpayers of millions of dollars i fail to understand why the city continues to favor an organization that has mismanaged taxpayer dollars
4477240 state wants money back from non profit los angeles time 12 22 04
4477241 i think we do have a team that would replace us versus tulane which would free us up to play the game in atlanta against virginia tech

4477244 indiana has so many outstanding employers that understand the importance of providing a positive work environment the best places to work program allows us to honor those deserving businesses that make company culture a priority

4477254 in a sense its economically viable for them to skirt the law and wait to see if they get sued because the exposure is not that huge
4477255 if they can settle a complaint for less than 100 percent of what they owe people for overtime theyve gotten away with a good deal its almost worthwhile to break the law the way its set up
4477256 i just want them to know they are not alone
4477257 i know what happened to those boys because it happened to me too
4477258 we would invite pastor crumbley to report the allegation to the district attorney
4477259 and to meet with appropriate representatives of the archdiocese to relay his story and prepare a signed statement as we would with any person having an allegation of abuse
4477260 sexually molested numerous times on various occasions by father harris from the time i was 13 to 16 years old
4477261 he and i were so close when i was growing up that people used to call me little father harris
4477262 i loved him but father harris repeatedly manipulated seemingly innocent everyday situations to his advantage to create any excuse to touch me improperly more specifically to fondle or to grab my genitals
4477263 with the exception of sharing this information years ago with a couple of very close people in my life i have held what happened to me in secret
4477264 as a result for years i have lived with intense anxiety sleeplessness and night terrors the experience also has affected my personal relationship with women
4477265 i do not believe the allegations that have been made against monsignor harris you would have to know him to know that he is a man of integrity compassion sound judgment and superior intelligence
4477266 what his parishioners say is all true he is a great guy capable of great things
4477267 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4477268 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4477269 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4477270 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4477271 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4477272 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4477274 scott garretts statements suggest that he would like to privatize social security on behalf of the special interests that fund his campaign just like his leader president bush i call upon scott garrett to state once and for all if he would like to hand social security over to wall street he has handed his congressional office over to a former lobbyist for the disgraced company at the center of the housing crisis countrywide financial and i fear he wants to hand social security over next
4477275 we intend to take a series of steps to liquidate the fund and redeem all fund investors at the same pace
4477276 after labor day we will commence a sell down of the funds security holdings in order to raise cash to fund redemptions
4477277 one of the largest gold derivatives portfolios in the world
4477278 the liquidation event is a result of it not being possible to effect redemptions in six of the investments within the credit investment portfolio
4477279 extreme volatility of certain capital markets over the last six months
4477280 returns have been hurt by one of the most volatile periods for fixed income in particular municipal markets in recent memory
4477281 the investment from citigroup provides the funds with additional equity capital and enough liquidity to make margin calls continue to operate and potentially recover a portion of the decline in net asset values
4477282 returns have been hurt by one of the most volatile periods for fixed income in particular municipal markets in recent memory
4477283 the investment from citigroup provides the funds with additional equity capital and enough liquidity to make margin calls continue to operate and potentially recover a portion of the decline in net asset values
4477284 meet demands for more collateral from its prime broker citigroup
4477285 the firm founded in early 2005 by tim obrien and philippe bubb had generated strong returns until this year
4477286 sowood and bear lost money primarily through market action but these were redemptions that were planned to occur when the lockup period ended
4477287 managers ability to know where to place a bet has been extremely difficult in this market with all of these announced transactions that appear as if they arent going to get done
4477288 from the siv managers point of view because its a leveraged business they are better positioned to take advantage of tight spreads than someone who doesnt have leverage and has to utilise capital
4477289 obviously it is harder getting returns than in a wider spread environment but the siv model allows you to outperform other investments if you have the appetite experience and can source the right assets at the same time in a tight environment its generally easier to find capital investors because a siv is a proven conservative structure but again the leverage provides good returns relative to other products
4477290 we have accomplished what we intended to do in connection with recent withdrawal requests and have an ample surplus in all respects
4477291 our poor performance this year generated significant withdrawals with redemptions of roughly 15 of assets in the september quarter end constraining our ability to fund and execute on our fundamental investment ideas
4477292 the decline in our assets has caused a significant strain on our infrastructure that was built for a much higher asset base the volatility caused by our down performance combined with our heightened awareness of the funds quarterly liquidity detracted from our goal of finding and maintaining significant positions in winning multi year ideas
4477293 the proposed restructuring of cheyne appeared to be a good solution for senior investors
4477294 if it does not succeed i would expect that senior investors in other troubled sivs will be disappointed as it seemed to give some hope should their siv also go into enforcement
4477295 we are trying to bring some stability to the situation while we see what the refinancing options are
4477296 forced to liquidate 6 billion in assets backing a commercial paper program
4477297 even though you are a well regarded investment vehicle if you cant roll over your paper and the market is concerned about the asset value of rolling over that paper investors are not going to refinance you in this environment
4477298 any fund with securities backed by lower quality u s mortgages is having trouble finding prices and valuations
4477299 there will be a flow on in the marketplace surrounding the problems experienced by basis and its investors but its too early to say exactly how that will pan out
4477300 the complete evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments of the u s securitization market has made it impossible to value certain assets fairly regardless of their quality or credit rating
4477301 the situation is such that it is no longer possible to value fairly the underlying u s abs assets in the three above mentioned funds
4477302 therefore unable to calculate a reliable net asset value nav for the funds
4477303 like many actors we have tried to revitalize the performance of our funds by investing in cdos
4477304 like others we noticed recent problems with short term liquidity and were caught out by the subprime dilemma
4477305 we did that as a defensive move because we had an unusually high number of redemption requests and we didnt want to be a forced seller in this market
4477306 these positions didnt get marked down until june nobodys hand was forced in the market until then
4477307 my guestimate in the subprime world is that the majority of loans are going to go into default not just 5 or 10 percent but the majority
4477308 orderly return of all of its capital to investors over the next 12 months in order to maximize value for shareholders
4477309 the message here is were not going to sit by and wait to connect all the dots before we go in and freeze
4477310 whether its conscious or not everyone is more attuned to concerns to whats going on with hedge funds
4477311 the commissions ability to inspect books and records is a critical regulatory tool that allows us access to a registrants daily operations
4477312 had 638 million in investor capital on march 31 and borrowed at least 6 billion to make 11 5 billion in bullish bets and 4 5 billion in bearish wagers
4477313 no one in the subprime business wants to ask the question of whether they need to re mark all the assets that would open the floodgates
4477314 everyone is trying to stop the problem but they should face up to it the assets may all be mispriced
4477315 this was related to the u s mortgage securities market which was obviously weakened by the u s subprime sector
4477316 operating a proprietary trading platform outside the investment bank and managing client money alongside became too complex and expensive that among other reasons is why we have chosen to reintegrate drcm into the investment bank and to redeem the outside investor funds
4477317 generate liquidity for investors in an orderly fashion with the goal of maximizing the proceeds of asset dispositions
4477318 ive never seen a hedge fund so highly leveraged in energy
4477319 we are in the process of developing a detailed plan for winding down the fund
4477320 there is a pretty high rate of mortality among hedge funds
4477321 when things are good they are very good but when theyre bad theyre awful
4477322 i actually have clients speculating that motherrock is not the only fund thats imploded its like the cockroach theory a light has been turned on and motherrock has been exposed just when the light turns on all the other roaches go scurrying under the refrigerator
4477323 i wouldnt be surprised if and when and it doesnt necessarily have to happen this week we find out another fund out there has been mortally wounded
4477324 failed to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade and failed to cooperate with nfa in an nfa audit and investigation
4477325 i still cant see any ow stop pushing my head

4477364 there is a lot of bitterness among ioc members towards mccain
4477365 several have come up to me and said that were mccain to be elected they would not be voting for
4477366 the ioc may have changed in many ways since he held his hearings but their attitude towards him and the rancour and the bitterness towards him runs deep
4477367 he rang me one day and he asked me to come over to his office
4477368 he asked me to lead the bid and i said i would so long as he answered two questions first how committed he was to the candidacy and he replied he was heavily committed and secondly could we sort out the problem over building the main stadium
4477369 this had been a crucial problem for new york when they bid for the 2012 games they came fourth and for our rivals for the american nomination san francisco
4477370 however we called on architects and engineers to come up with a plan and the architects especially produced an economically feasible plan

4477383 i feel like my personality is being squashed down and hidden away i need to get a bit aggressive and get pumped up when i do that i can shoot 10s
4477384 i was cheesed off with my performance and then went straight into interviews
4477385 sometimes you say stuff in the heat of the moment which you otherwise wouldnt
4477386 ive got loads and loads of individual medals and you learn from your own mistakes
4477387 maybe if i had gone in there with a bit more aggression there might have been a different outcome
4477388 but i think i thought this is just another step rather than going in thinking this is it winning this one match is all i need to do
4477389 any concerns the archers have and take away from these games we will be reviewing and discussing and looking how we can address those concerns so we are fully prepared for 2012

4477432 when i was about 8 or 9 years old i invented the slap shot
4477433 i was practicing a lot one of the newspaper men in montreal charlie boire said if you can name mantle mickey how about if i call you boom boom well do whatever you want to do i dont care i think a nickname is great
4477434 montreal was a powerhouse for five stanley cups in a row when we got beat by the trying for our sixth in a row in 1960 61 we didnt have that drive after the fifth one
4477435 we wanted to win the sixth one but i have to give credit to the with glenn hall stan mikita all of those guys rudy pilous was the coach they beat us and they deserved to win it we didnt deserve to win at all
4477436 i dont think thats going to be broken i hope one team one day they are going to do it but i doubt it very much i think the closest one was the islanders cup winners between 1980 and 1983 and they blew it
4477437 you know you can have all of the records in the world but when you put your name on the cup for the first time when you are 18 or 19 years old it is the greatest thrill in the world i got 50 goals in 60 61 that is nothing compared to winning the first stanley cup of your life
4477438 in montreal it was terrible there must have been a million people there
4477439 it was just like when the yankees were winning in the 1950s and early 1960s they used to have a parade we werent allowed to take the stanley cup but they gave us a miniature one we used to go all over with it click for larger photo

4477585 were no shrinking violet on that issue but we dont choose to use the olympics to make that point
4477586 seeing how quietly this news has been released has surprised us all
4477587 officials have confirmed that a press release will not be issued by either the ministers of canadian heritage or foreign affairs
4477588 that this communications strategy was specifically intended to minimize negative reaction from industry stakeholders
4477589 were surprised by the cancellations because this government has been quite vocal about the importance of canadas role internationally the importance of our exports and being competitive globally it feels counterintuitive and counterproductive
4477590 we were on a teleconference with the canadian conference of the arts and somebody checked their web site and found out that theyd posted this
4477591 apparently thats how most of us are finding out not that anyones contacted us from heritage its just posted on web sites and all of a sudden the programs are gone
4477592 if its not short term electoral strategy what the hell is it

4477600 the clearest example of echoing hezbollah came monday when thousands attended a so called victory rally and mahmoud zahar an influential hamas leader briefly came out of hiding to tell the rallygoers that his organization would rebuild any house that had been damaged by the israeli strikes
4477601 very concerned that the role model for hamas in gaza is the lebanese hezbollah
4477602 to allocate 5 million to compensate gaza residents whose properties were damaged in the israeli campaign
4477603 the israeli operation increased hamas popularity in the eyes of residents of the strip the zionist leaders are blinds they didnt learn from al aqsa intifada
4477604 hamas now is knowing that the zionist entity has the excellence just by the war planes
4477605 if the israeli ground forces had not been backed up from the air

4477613 our distribution benefits immediately from having a superior product with the same high level of service and support that they expect from us cary martin brings to aqua control many years of lake and pond management experience in addition to strong sales and customer service skills he is an industry expert and has tremendous knowledge of aeration and water quality

4477619 the leading clubs have a responsibility to try to make the games attractive they can never be a long term target to play a dirty game or one which is not attractive
4477620 we want to play our game because we feel it is the most efficient way to win
4477621 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other when it comes to points it becomes a bit different

4477653 the plan is to play in the first game of the season i dont know my involvement because i wont have played pre season but thats the plan
4477654 i dont question that ive always had the desire thats the animal i am i cant question that
4477655 i said some time ago about practice its not a conscious choice any more its something i know that its part of my life and i will do it
4477656 the difficult one will be telling myself to give up certainly not wondering whether now is the time
4477657 maybe someone will have to come in there and decide for me
4477658 my shoulder is really good i dont know when it started feeling bad i think i was getting some pain pre world cup in the six nations 2003
4477659 my neck took control after that and ive not really played since so once i strung some games together there was obviously a problem
4477660 the shoulder problem has been there five years it was quite a long way gone so it was a great idea to get it done
4477661 when i was playing in some games i felt like i had no problem but in others i was waking up really struggling
4477662 it was tough to keep going so when there was an opportunity to get it done in the summer i took it
4477663 it had degenerated quite a lot so it needed quite a bit of sorting out i was told id be out for four months and at the moment im on schedule
4477664 his fear factor is a good thing i feared him for about six years of playing with him it was about that long before i spoke to him
4477665 having got to know him you still have that respect and awe for him so things do not change
4477666 some of the younger guys have asked what its like having a guy you played with for so long in that position
4477667 different or odd because of his supernatural father im guessing none of the above because from all indications mary received her child with nothing but humility and joy

4477674 so much time has passed 16 years since the war began but at the moment we are speaking only about today when we restored our territorial integrity
4477675 this is where we stopped them 16 years ago i was here that day armed only with a two meter stick and a bottle of petrol but we stopped them
4477676 now we have driven them out of kodori i will tell you one thing no georgian foot will ever set foot on our territory
4477677 everyone says the russians have armed us but they havent
4477678 here wait write this america has provided weapons to abkhazia i major general kupalba officially announce this they used the georgians as intermediaries
4477679 the georgians ran away and there were piles of kit like this all around
4477680 it is easy for us to fight because we are just defending our own
4477681 uitm adalah darah daging saya darah bangsa saya dan saya rela bergadai nyawa untuk mempertahankannya jangan sesiapa cuba mengganggu gugat keistimewaan ini

4477683 as an organisation we had built up a high degree of debt that we could not service but that all changed at the point of sale
4477684 we are now debt free have changed to a more conservative accounting policy and have reduced our cost base
4477685 there are only five credible players and we have more capabilities for global enterprises than anyone else because we can get them anywhere in the world and have a leading ethernet technology under our own brand
4477686 jika anwar juga bersumpah laknat seperti itu maka jadilah mubahalah dan kita akan lihat hukuman tuhan nanti
4477687 saya terkejut dengan keberaniannya bermubahalah tetapi dia sebenarnya menanggung risiko yang amat besar
4477688 tetapi dia juga perlu faham akan kesan sumpah yang dibuatnya jika dia berbohong

4477690 ries smits van het cda krijgt deze week de prijs van meest doortrapte politicus
4477691 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4477692 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4477693 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4477694 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4477695 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4477696 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4477697 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4477698 the squad is better but we now have problems on the left because we have lost john arne riise harry kewell and sebastian leto
4477699 we will see what happens in the future with that situation but clearly our squad is better
4477700 you have to be opportunistic when you have a squad like ours i would just like our olympic players back to help us but we will probably have one player in the final the rest can return soon
4477701 the age of the squad is much lower they are good players and can be a very good team for now and the future
4477702 our fans want a trophy every season they would want the league title the champions league the fa cup and the carling cup in that order
4477703 but if you asked me what i would prefer then i would say i agree with our supporters
4477704 what we appreciate in the relations with our german partners is the confidence and the commitment to listen to each other
4477705 of course this does not mean that we are always of the same opinion
4477706 doctors are keen to introduce solids as early as possible as a supplement to breast feeding and they couldnt be more wrong

4477719 everything that exists had its origin in the primeval celestial waters
4477720 we were sitting in the corner near the pool when we heard a woman yell help help at first it didnt sound like a frantic yell but this all happened in seconds so we responded
4477721 i got there first and when i got to him he was kind of drowning me too i got down under the water and pushed up on him while nestor pulled him toward the shallow end of the pool
4477722 the man was at the shallow end of the pool when he was still panicking and kicking and punching
4477723 it was at this point that nestor said you can stand up now
4477724 when this all started i was just sitting there looking at my books
4477725 when we jumped in sergeant cobo was pushing him up on his left knee and i pulled him by the waist to the shallow area
4477726 when he and his family went back in he did wave and say thank you i think he may have been embarrassed but i do know he was happy nothing worse happened
4477727 it was scary in the beginning because ive done this before but not to this extent the first thing i thought about after we finished was the mans two young daughters who were also in the pool i can only imagine what could have happened if we werent there and how devastating that would have been to those two girls
4477728 its one of those things you can feel good about and know that you helped someone
4477729 when someone calls for help you respond as security forces members thats what we know to do

4477739 you will be more than guaranteed in the hands of the republic and you know the banking sector of venezuela is one of the most solid in the world
4477740 riot police used tear gas as they blocked hundreds of venezuelans protesting what they call new moves by president chavez to concentrate his power
4477741 blacklists barring key opposition candidates from elections and socialist decrees destroying whats left of their democracy

4477746 is using his decree powers to enact a set of socialist inspired measures that seem based on a package of constitutional changes
4477747 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
4477748 formalize socialist inspired policies on the margins of the formal economy like a measure declaring barter a legitimate system of payment
4477749 the coming regional elections have the potential to erode the presidents power base
4477750 to set up neighborhood based militias state control over agriculture
4477751 chavez enact ing aggressive new laws with an iron fist increasing the states power over the economy ahead of key regional elections
4477752 drive to create a socialist state significantly increase his power and resemble proposals included in a constitutional reform narrowly rejected by voters in a december referendum
4477753 up in arms over a raft of decree laws they say replicate constitutional reforms
4477754 typical of mr chavezs authoritarian streak and will let him expropriate private property without the need for the ans approval
4477755 ambitious decrees which formalize the creation of a popular militia and further consolidate state control over key areas of the economy such as agriculture and tourism
4477756 bypass ing congress in making laws and being back on the offensive after suffering a humiliating defeat in december that might have let him stay in power for life
4477757 accusations that mr chavez is evading the will of the people
4477758 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup detat to the constitution here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
4477759 everything hes doing is related to the upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power
4477760 put ting down all challengers to his power forcibly if necessary
4477761 get in the way of mr chavezs caudillo aspirations at your peril
4477762 its as effective as anything except perhaps scraping each one individually which is bloody and can be painful
4477763 but new ones could pop up elsewhere or even in the same general area if they were incubating at the time of treatment

4477770 wow i never knew you were married to a black woman
4477771 i just saw there was a need in crittenden county and knew it was something i needed to do
4477772 part of gods genius in all of this is that arms around families is taking a holistic approach
4477773 if those parents are court ordered to attend theyre going to ask well what do i do with my kids if you address the parenting issues without taking on those other problems youre going to send them right back out to fail
4477774 parenting wisely is a 16 week program we have components that deal with alcohol abuse substance abuse child abuse and discipline
4477775 we have professionals from the community who come in to talk about specific topics such as immunization child safety those kind of things
4477776 they are very open to share some of the inappropriate things that may have gone on in their lives
4477777 are ordered to attend by children and family services drug court family court district court some are here because their attorney advised them to take the class because of a custody issue
4477778 things like how to say no appropriately how to call 911 how to avoid being a bully and how to deal with a bully
4477779 parents work different schedules so kids often eat in front of the tv we teach them to sit at a table and eat a meal and to have prayer before meals these little things can make a big difference over a period of several months
4477780 for instance the courts cant order anyone to attend a parenting class at emanuel baptist church but the courts can order parents to attend a class without specifying where
4477781 since we happen to have the only parenting class in the area they show up here
4477782 we have provided a resource not just in our community but to communities within a 60 mile radius
4477783 when you go to alcoholics anonymous or narcotics anonymous they only talk about a higher power
4477784 celebrate recovery involves a faith element it includes prayer and a worship service often we have people that tell us this is the first time theyve heard the gospel when they were sober so it could mean something to them
4477785 we had a church that wanted to do this in an upper middle class neighborhood as parenting enrichment to fit their community but i told them they need to have a plan because god will use that program to bring in people they dont expect
4477786 you need a plan for what youre going to do when a kid comes in with head lice because his or her parents have only been requiring the children to take a bath once a week what will you do
4477787 we had a parent who showed up to tell us the spouse had threatened to steal the baby as part of a custody dispute
4477788 do you wilt or do you put plans in place to deal with it we locked all the doors except one and we had everyone come in and out that door and put our child care people on alert to assure that nothing happened
4477789 we had a couple who was not properly handling their babys bottles it was causing health problems for the baby
4477790 over several weeks the parents learned about making sure the bottles were clean and the milk properly formulated within a short time the babys cheeks were filled out it had good color and the baby was more responsive to the surroundings
4477791 we had a lady in the parenting class who had very low self esteem
4477792 our volunteers began to talk to her and interact with her you could see a physical and spiritual strength that had not been there before she had just grown as a person and that translates into her being a better parent for her children because she feels better about herself
4477793 weve seen a lot of people just bloom during the program
4477794 i know ive had occasions when some of the women in the program were reluctant to engage in conversations with me i came to realize that many of the participants have been in less than ideal relationships this program may be the first opportunity for some of these women to be in a non threatening conversation or situation with a man
4477795 i think our philosophy in the 90s was to create as many inroads into the sunday morning service to get people to church on sunday
4477796 whats actually happening here is that tuesday night is becoming their church service
4477797 i told a pastor friend who came to visit that it might be difficult to get some of our tuesday participants churched
4477798 he grabbed my arm and said dont think that youre not churching just not sunday morning churching them
4477799 most of our participants start out thinking that this is something they need to do to make life better
4477800 its more than that this is becoming their church there are some things about being a traditional church member that they may never get what im coming to realize is thats not bad it has the same spiritual value to them just as if they were here on sunday morning

4477827 theres a small bump as you go on and off the astilleros bridge which could unsettle the cars in the wet and then theres a 90 degree right before the track drops away and you head down a long curved straight
4477828 you brake really hard for turn 12 and it is here that it feels most like a street circuit because there are traffic lights hanging across the track and you can see buildings
4477829 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it i think the whole of formula one is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful we have some very fast circuits like silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like valencia to be somewhere in the middle its also got the added excitement of being surrounded by barriers which really focuses your mind and demands that you give full concentration around every single lap
4477830 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia
4477831 people arent used to turning the tap and not getting water

4477847 what seemed like a positive trend in the employee confidence index over the past two months appears to have taken a hit this month
4477848 clearly there are lingering concerns over the economy and job market that have impacted workers overall confidence levels despite this new low in overall confidence its important for employers to note that the workforce is keeping their eyes open for other opportunities those employers that are waiting for rosy economic headlines are already too late when it comes to finding top talent with economists now projecting several more months of job loss ahead employers will most likely remain cautious about hiring until they have an immediate need and at that point it might be too late
4477849 in the past two years the company has invested in infrastructure and management and we anticipate a rapid acceleration of earnings as neogenomics leverages its newly created capacity the company recently completed the transition from a wholesale to a retail business model and is poised to deliver significant long term growth as a provider of high end genetic testing services for cancer the scarcity of qualified genetics cancer labs enables neogenomics to effectively compete with much larger institutions which merits a premium multiple for the shares

4477861 you would normally expect the mortgage rate to follow the term deposit rate downwards
4477862 its funny earlier this week we heard that one of the reasons banks could not cut mortgage rates was the high returns being paid to savers
4477863 now we are seeing savings rates falling and the banks still arent cutting rates they are running out of excuses
4477864 its classic profiteering the banks think everybody is keeping a close eye on mortgage rates and has forgotten about savings rates and credit cards
4477865 as for raising their credit card rates now you can make your own mind up about that there is simply no excuse
4477866 we take any changes to interest rates very seriously taking into account the total cost of funds competitive pressures and impact on customers these are the factors behind this particular card interest rate change

4477879 only akhil can do that he was all along confident and he proved that it was not mere wishful thinking on his part we are so proud of him
4477880 the job however is not done yet even though the win would fill him with more confidence trailing 2 6 few would have come out winner but he managed that he is supremely confident and knows what he is going to do
4477881 we just could not figure out what roger was doing in the court he proved why he is among the all time greats probably you cannot do much when you have the best player in the world on the other side of the net and with him a player who does not miss anything

4477891 we miss her every day it doesnt get any easier
4477892 im disappointed but whether the sentence was longer or shorter would never have made up for what happened
4477893 i am definitely supporting pam i definitely hope that he does not get custody of the kids
4477894 georges anger is constant and persistent he is unable to control his anger in front of the children
4477895 george would criticise and pick fights with pam or the nannies
4477896 george faulted me with the incident and yelled at me that i was useless in front of georgie
4477897 when i asked george if he was serious in blaming me for such an incident he fired me on the spot and sent me to my room to pack my belongings while he stood over me in an intimidating way and pointing his finger at me
4477898 george then realised that since pam was away and he was incapable of handling the three children on his own that he need me to stay until pam returned from work i agreed to stay because i was concerned for the kids and i had promised pam that i would take good care of the kids in her absence
4477899 i am definitely supporting pam i definitely hope that he does not get custody of the kids
4477900 if theyd just said thank you to me 30 years ago 20 years ago 10 then that wouldve been the end of it but theyve never even bought me a cup of coffee
4477901 for years people have thought i was earning a lot of money from the show but i havent received a single cent since my last pay cheque from fauna about 200 in 1968
4477902 when i saw the latest boxed set of dvds i thought ive had enough
4477903 i believe hes entitled to be compensated for his role in the show
4477904 weve lodged documents with the supreme court equity division seeking declarations he is entitled to be adequately compensated
4477905 its going to be a complex and drawn out exercise but i would have thought were talking millions
4477906 hard hitting tv ads have had a major influence in driving down the smoking rate over the past decade
4477907 this campaign will ask smokers directly why they still smoke despite everybody knowing tobacco causes cancer stroke heart disease and emphysema
4477908 and of course every plane goes over my electorate no matter where they are headed
4477909 i dont hide from the fact that there will be increased noise to the north of the airport but the increase will be for a shorter period and every effort will be made to minimise disruption
4477910 i would never recommend any woman to have her baby delivered in a private hospital

4477917 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4477918 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4477919 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
4477920 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4477921 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
4477922 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere
4477923 im mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore this didnt have to happen
4477924 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
4477925 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
4477926 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
4477927 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4477928 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4477929 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4477930 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4477931 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4477932 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
4477933 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
4477934 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region
4477935 fisheries in flux how do we ensure our sustainable future
4477936 two key issues affecting fisheries sustainability are the reduction of bycatch the incidental harvest of non target species and the problem of plastic pollution in our marine environment
4477937 our booth will document work toward the design of halibut and salmon excluder devices for trawl nets as well as our nationally recognized efforts at marine debris cleanup
4477938 rank with over fishing habitat loss and harmful algal blooms as global environmental problems
4477939 there is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time as dissolved oxygen
4477940 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places
4477941 to keep fertilizers on the land and out of the sea
4477942 they certainly dont want to see their dollars flowing off their fields into the bay
4477943 scientists and farmers need to continue working together to develop farming methods that minimize the transfer of nutrients from land to sea
4477944 older people are among the prime contributors to climate change but also potentially some of the first casualties there is an urgent need to exploit synergies between climate change policies and policies aimed at older people and to avoid duplication and contradiction older people must be part of the solution we need to make it easier for them to conserve energy use public transport and maintain crucial social networks that will help them better cope with the effects of a changing climate
4477945 two enormous but utterly predictable waves will be rolling across the global landscape in the coming decades the ageing of our populations and the effects of climate change whatever other political and social policy changes will command our attention these two challenges will be constant and unrelenting older people are likely to be physically financially and emotionally less resilient to climate change and government strategies will need to address this
4477946 george now i like the way you say that george ah well how many numbers ya got
4477947 oh i got numbers comin outta my ears for instance ten
4477948 yeah thats how many months old my baby girl is
4477949 yeah yeah sexy huh how bout this for a number six thats how old my other daughter is eight is the age of my son two is how many times ive been married and divorced sixteen is the number of dollars i have in my bank account 850 3943 thats my phone number and with all the numbers i gave you im guessing zero is the number of times youre gonna call it
4477950 hey how the hell do you remember your bank balance right off the top of your head like that see that impresses me youre dead wrong about that zero thing baby
4477951 numbers for end of life tvs have been over 20 million per year since 2005 and are expected to go up to almost 25 million by 2010
4477952 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4477953 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4477954 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4477955 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4477956 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4477957 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4477958 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4477959 i got an apology from mr critchley and i forgive him
4477960 i just needed that i needed it for closure maybe now my daughters can rest
4477961 he was crying he was very genuine i told him i knew he did not come here intending on killing six people
4477962 immense suffering for the families as well as the victims it has caused heartache and suffering for my family also
4477963 i ask for the families forgiveness and prayers and i will pray for your families and loved ones and i will carry this with me for the rest of my life

4477965 we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4477966 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4477967 didnt really come up with the proper response at the time
4477968 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4477969 encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4477970 this fix will stop the flood this time we mean it
4477971 i used to tell people when i first came that we considered forensic science boys town but now its more like a girls world
4477972 i have to think that theres got to be some relationship between the roles that are represented on tv and the way women see whats possible for them as a career
4477973 a lot of them do realize that riding around in the hummers and wearing prada is not the day to day things
4477974 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
4477975 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
4477976 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make
4477977 i just kind of meshed him coming home and telling stories at the dinner table to my love for science and that kind of morphed into wanting to do this
4477978 you should talk about stuff rather than keep it inside
4477979 we hope this makes a difference in other kids lives
4477980 so its a matter of finding a passionate person to say were doing this at our school

4477984 he has really made it a priority to practice what he teaches
4477985 not only how the environment is affecting our health but how humans the medical industry affect the environment
4477986 i want to make it very clear that i am in favor of vaccination
4477987 like no beauty pageant youve seen before six young men dressed as six young women compete in a prestigious beauty pageant to determine who will be the new miss glamouresse this silly fun musical is miss america meets some like it hot and you may even get to choose the winner

4477989 superintendent david thweatt said a main concern was that the small community is a 30 minute drive from the sheriffs office leaving students and teachers without protection
4477990 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4477991 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4477992 it is to the credit of human nature that except where its selfishness is brought into play it loves more readily than it hates
4477993 its always a tough decision when we decide to chase because we always have to take innocent bystanders into account but when you have two innocent kids in a car and somebody thats high on narcotics we look out for the welfare of those children

4477997 were so excited we just told the family this past monday they thought it was great news i couldnt hide it any more the second time you show faster
4477998 im feeling very tired the first time around i could put my feet up and relax this time i have a baby to run after and carry
4477999 aumentar las penas como la cadena perpetua no resolver el principal problema de m xico que es la impunidad pues el 99 por ciento de los 12 millones de los delitos que se cometen cada a o en el pa s no son castigados
4478000 la verdadera dimensi n del problema de la inseguridad est en la impunidad pues de esos 12 millones de il citos s lo son denunciados un mill n 200 mil de los cuales nicamente 120 mil reciben sentencia condenatoria en los tribunales
4478001 el incremento de sanciones no sirve porque va en aumento la criminalidad adem s ha llevado al extremo diversos casos en oaxaca una persona fue condenada a 105 a os de prisi n y no hay quien viva tanto tiempo para cumplir con esa condena
4478002 suburbs have been able to dodge the bullet a bit longer than urban schools because they are both less diverse and have fewer of the high risk students as a group that was probably next in line to be flagged it was probably suburban schools
4478003 the key thing is to make the process simple and quick
4478004 just tick a few boxes and the rest is done in the background
4478005 we are getting some real focus and commitment from cisco and linksys resellers will now feel part of a larger family
4478006 there will be benefits to being part of the cisco programme
4478007 bringing everything together is a natural decision we are building the broadest portfolio from transactional small deals right the way up to sophisticated unified communications deployments
4478008 it adds breadth and allows resellers to address the growing sme opportunity very easily
4478009 if youre going through hell make sure to stop and smell the burning flesh
4478010 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4478011 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4478012 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4478013 estoy en el noveno que bueno yo hubiera querido m s
4478014 yeah i might be able to do x if i put my all into it
4478015 although we ran a regular practice it was live tackling similar to a scrimmage
4478016 we went through certain drills and ran play action and we got better there is no question in my mind that we got better we got better on offense defense got to the ball and we learned a lot from today
4478017 you try to cover them in practice but in the scrimmage they just appear thats when the players have to take over and be able to call out and understand what we are looking for
4478018 he was able to distribute it and i think that he was comfortable with the timing he was a little rusty when we got started off the bat but settled in
4478019 we tried to build on the defense and stop the run
4478020 we ran one versus two a lot so that the twos could run the ball at them give them different short yardage situations so that they could learn how to convert defensively
4478021 it is not necessary to rinse the dishes before putting them into the dishwasher the wash module removes food particles from the water
4478022 mix items in each section of the basket with some pointing up and some down to avoid nesting always load sharp items knives skewers etc pointing down
4478023 we let you handle capture retention archiving and content management to manage your content proactively because the information has already been retained classified and managed
4478024 they are expensive because organizations often have to expand them to deal with other cases and typically these solutions dont address the bigger problem of information retention
4478025 we want e discovery to be part of the basic daily process rather than having you run around putting out fires
4478026 nobody has the breadth anymore to cover all databases all repositories it requires a very large set of capabilities and ibm global services and eds are among the few entities that folks love to help solve that kind of complex problem
4478027 a very important part of the ediscovery process is that the tools you use must respect things like deletion policies and keep accurate logs of access and searches

4478031 its a visible sign of americas commitment to our security the missiles are not directed against anybody but its something that we feel we deserve being members of nato for 10 years now and having very little in terms of nato security infrastructure
4478032 look whats in their bags too some kids will stash away other outfits that you dont even know they bought
4478033 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
4478034 the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result
4478035 why my feeling was so easily led to a direction where i actually dont want to go
4478036 what do you really care about in your whole life whats your life goal what do you live for

4478038 our goal is not only to keep the essential items in stock at everyday low costs but also help caterers present elegant parties at prices they and their clients can afford especially during these tough economic times
4478039 im excited at joining such a great and truly global company as nokia i see this as an inspiring new challenge there is a lot to learn but i believe i will be able to draw on my experience from both a think tank environment as well as from international politics it is a privilege to serve on nokias group executive board and i really look forward to working with the nokia team
4478040 veli sundb ck brought to nokia valuable experience and knowledge of international affairs at a time when nokia was expanding fast into other markets
4478041 the university of toronto has partnered with ibm to become one of the worlds premier computational research institutions a collaboration that will attract researchers from around the world
4478042 scinet will have one of the best facilities in the world that will allow canadian physicists to participate in the adventure of the large hadron collider
4478043 this research may change our view of matter and the universe
4478044 a system this complex could only be designed by bringing together the best minds from the university of toronto and ibm
4478045 this is a tremendous example of public and private collaboration that will benefit the canadian research community for many years to come
4478046 we now offer a group of solutions for this fast growing segment of the m2m device connectivity market
4478047 device connectivity requirements are everywhere with the operational safety and rugged features of these products customers can reliably extend their device networks into the harshest of environments
4478048 we are very pleased to have entered into the merger agreement with csl
4478049 we at talecris have long admired csl the opportunity for our employees customers distributors suppliers and most importantly our patients to benefit from being part of the csl family is exciting and is a testament to the quality and strength of talecris relationships with its stakeholders at the same time the transaction represents a good return for our shareholders many of whom are our employees
4478050 we believe talecris has demonstrated a track record of the utmost integrity and ethics and has some of the most widely used life enhancing plasma derived therapies available
4478051 patients count on talecris to provide them with the therapies they need we are committed to growing and enhancing the business to the benefit of all stakeholders
4478052 there are not that many single drug targets that are mutated so frequently in cancer and that are in classes of enzymes where we know how to make a drug pi3 kinase is one of these targets and thats why it is sky high on the list of exciting new targets in cancer
4478053 there are not that many single drug targets that are mutated so frequently in cancer and that are in classes of enzymes where we know how to make a drug
4478054 pi3 kinase is one of these targets and thats why it is sky high on the list of exciting new targets in cancer
4478055 we were surprised by this result so we said okay if the gatekeeper in pi3 kinase is not the functional equivalent of the gatekeeper in protein kinases lets look at some other sites
4478056 what the result says is that maybe resistance will be a little bit harder to come by than in protein kinases so thats an advantage for those trying to make pi3 kinase drugs
4478057 and it may not be that hard to come up with other compounds that inhibit cancers that become resistant
4478058 the most direct implication of this work is that it teaches people that there are resistance mutations that are going to come up and you may as well try to come up with drugs against this right now
4478059 hes a very strong and athletic lad and he has important experience at the top level we can call upon
4478060 ive liked the look of him in training and also liked his attitude in the few days hes been with us
4478061 i think he did well in the short time he was on the pitch in last weeks friendly against osasuna
4478062 its a good deal for both the club financially and for amdy who im sure will figure in the stoke squad on a regular basis
4478063 jeromes a young player that harry has always liked a quick wide player who is a good addition to the squad
4478064 the idea is that he comes here and proves himself
4478065 we were very worried at the time parc was first announced mostly because the thought of a prison in a quiet village like ours was quite frightening
4478066 we were worried about what might happen when the prisoners were released or when their families came to visit
4478067 but it hasnt worried us at all we have built up great contacts with the prison and theyve helped us financially with items for the village including paying for new gates for coity castle
4478068 we have even had some lovely hanging baskets made by the prisoners
4478069 so i would tell people in cwmbran and elsewhere not to worry
4478070 there is a need for a prison in north wales because all our prisoners have to go to england and we believe its vital to have a local prison to help reduce reoffending by working with prisoners in their own communities
4478071 it is also important to look at female prisoners and young offenders both of whom have to travel outside north wales and in the case of young offenders that can mean being housed more than 200 miles from their families
4478072 with all the prison places in england it is very difficult for first language welsh speakers to get any education or training in their own language
4478073 we merken steeds vaker dat klanten behoefte hebben aan advies en ondersteuning naast admanagement en adserving alleen onder interactive maven kunnen wij deze diensten nog beter vormgeven we blijven overigens nog wel traffick werkzaamheden uitvoeren onder de triple ad vlag
4478074 there were a lot of changes going on and i had a feeling that something was going to happen
4478075 when it happens its always a little shocking but i wasnt shocked at that trade because i wasnt playing that much at the time
4478076 when i got to chicago i was doing all right
4478077 we got on a roll and we got into the playoffs and lost in the first round to colorado then there was a gm change over the summer bob murray took over after bob pulford i came back to training camp and i was excited but i kind of had a feeling that i wasnt going to be there at all its hard to describe how you get that feeling but i had that feeling
4478078 we had a new apartment and my wife was pregnant so i went over to the states a little early to unpack and get settled in
4478079 but a few days into training camp i started to pack down everything again when my wife came over everything was packed again except for enough kitchen stuff that we could get by
4478080 there were also a lot of rumors that they were trying to make a trade for brett hull for that trade they were going to give up a lot of young players maybe if they had done that deal they would have needed me but that trade didnt come through and they chose to go with the young players i didnt feel like i was old i was only 30 years old but on the right side they had eric daze and tony amonte
4478081 they wanted to get the kids in there and i ended up sitting at home for six weeks waiting for a decision to be made because they didnt want to send me to the minor leagues
4478082 they wanted to find something else to do with me for us it was also kind of tough because my wife was getting closer to week 32 of her pregnancy and you cant fly after that we signed a buy out document on a tuesday the movers came wednesday and thursday we flew back to sweden because that was the last day my wife could fly
4478083 i wasnt having fun sitting there and waiting i went back and i started to play in sweden and i was having a lot of fun
4478084 i was getting offers after the first year but i wanted to go to good team
4478085 i wanted to go to a team where i knew i had a chance to win the stanley cup the teams that showed the most interest were younger teams or expansion teams so i decided to stay back in sweden for another year after that year is when washington called
4478086 the team was in the finals two years earlier then they missed the playoffs but they had a lot of injuries it was an interesting situation to come into also calle johansson was playing here and calle has been my best friend since i was 15 years old everything kind of fell into place here
4478087 you kind of had a feeling that you were going to get drafted
4478088 there were quite a few teams that you talked to and said they would pick you if you were still out there i wasnt sure youre never sure until i got a phone call and was told that i was drafted seventh and calle was drafted 14th
4478089 one of the reasons for that was that i played in a tournament when i was 15 and i got the mvp of that tournament and the prize was a jersey from anders hedberg and a personal letter it was kind of nice
4478090 we were kind of in charge of eight others it was a sports group of 10 and we were the two lieutenants because we did the extra three months in the summer before the other eight joined the army
4478091 we actually talked quite a bit about if we were ready to go or not
4478092 i remember that we kind of said its time to go we won the championship in sweden that year and i was ready to move on the dream for me since i started to play hockey and since i started to realize what it was was to play in the nhl when you had the opportunity to go there you wanted to go we always said that if it doesnt work out we can always come back to sweden and play well go there work hard and see what happens
4478093 the city i grew up in has two lanes going through the middle of town other than that its one lane all over the place where me and calle played was a little bit bigger town but coming to new york and going to manhattan and driving to madison square garden as your home arena was quite a big difference it was all good guys playing on the team so you got a lot of help where you should go and where you should be careful things like that tomas sandstrom was playing there he was in his fourth year there even some of the north american players were helpful john vanbiesbrouck helped me get a car most of the guys were really good they helped me out most of the time
4478094 where im from up north its cold in winter mostly there are a lot of scandanavian people in minnesota so if you look in the phone book you think youre home its a lot of third generation scandanavians so they know a few words of swedish but not much
4478095 i actually enjoyed playing in minnesota a lot we went to the finals in 1991 which is one of the best memories i have of playing in the nhl probably together with the run we had with the capitals after christmas last year winning all the time
4478096 but when they announced they were going to move the team they sold out every game for the rest of the year there were a lot of emotional things for the fans they didnt really support the team when we had it but when they realized they were going to lose it they started feeling bad about it it is a good hockey area so hopefully it will work out well with a new team there
4478097 it was fun because we got on a roll at the end of the year when i got traded there and we got into the playoffs
4478098 we ended up playing the detroit red wings who were one of the favorites to go all the way that year and we knocked them out in game seven
4478099 we played toronto in the second round we were up 3 1 in games and we were in overtime in game 5 and johan garpenlov hits the crossbar and they torontos mike gartner score on the next rush going the other way we were really close to making it to the semi finals in my first year then we ended up losing game seven against toronto
4478100 the second year we beat calgary who was one of the favorites to go a long way
4478101 but in the second round we hit detroit and they were more ready for us that year but those two years it was a lot of fun the whole city was shark crazy it was a good bunch a lot of veteran players with a good mix of young players we bonded good together and played hard for each other
4478102 i think those two years when i went back to sweden i got really hungry at hockey again
4478103 the chicago situation kind of took a lot of the air out of me because i basically just sat for six weeks and was being bought out and not wanted going back and playing those two years got me really hungry we dont play that many games there im going to turn 34 next year and hopefully i can kind of extend my career because i went back and played two years in sweden im going to try to stay in shape and work hard and see if i can play maybe one or two more years
4478104 there were certainly times when youd think about it because you always want to be as big a part of the team as you can
4478105 the way things went for me at the start of the year i wasnt a big part at all i wasnt playing very much but i tried to keep a good attitude about it and work hard in practice and try to earn more ice time but it was tough i signed in july and at that time i slowed things down a little bit i probably thought i was working out hard to get into shape but when i got here i dont think i was in excellent game shape i was fortunate enough to get time to work extra when i wasnt playing much i worked at practice with strength and conditioning coach frank costello in the weight room and on the bike and i caught up to game shape and i was fortunate enough to get a chance to get more ice time
4478106 it was something that just happened when i was going around the net and then i kind of built on it
4478107 ive been doing it more and more its just something that happens i dont think of how im going to put my skates in certain situations it just happens
4478108 maybe you get a little better balance because you get your feet out wider i dont remember when i started doing it i dont remember why i started doing it but i know that ive started to use it more and more and in more places on the ice at first it was just on wraparounds
4478109 most europeans are fast skaters and are pretty good in open ice
4478110 ive never been a great skater so i always ended up getting to work along the boards and getting to beat people along the boards in battles i did it when i played in sweden and then when i came over here that kind of game is used more because the ice is smaller ive probably survived in the league because so much of the game is along the boards and thats where i like to play
4478111 we have a hard working team and i kind of like that because thats the kind of player i always want to be i go out there and work as hard as i can because thats all you can do
4478112 other than that i just try to spend as much time as i can with my family i have two kids and nothing is more fun than spending time with them
4478113 i ended up working 45 minutes for one fish and thats the biggest one that i caught on a fly fishing rod
4478114 it was a trout it was five pounds forty five minutes is a long time with a fly fishing rod youre kind of tired in your arms after that i didnt even eat it i had it as a showoff fish in my freezer until i left and i gave it to my parents they ate it and they said it tasted good
4478115 youre 20 years old and you have all your friends and family back home so you do get homesick
4478116 but its also kind of jumping into a dream when you start playing there and playing with players you admired growing up and then the years go so fast and all of a sudden youre one of the older guys its been a lot of fun

4478125 he is an intelligent boy and that is always a very good ingredient when you are intelligent in life and with talent you always have a chance
4478126 for me he is a player who has a good engine good technique and vision he can play the final ball which we like here he has the technical level to go into any combination and is very mobile
4478127 we believe he has the ingredients to fit into our game
4478128 he can replace alex hleb in the build up of the game in the creation of the chances and he is very versatile he is also very young the same age as
4478129 we dont really care who were playing all we want to do is get back out on the pitch and try to make up for monday night
4478130 we just want to put the memory of the hamilton game behind us as quickly as we can
4478131 the biggest thing is that we know we probably couldnt play any worse than we did
4478132 i reckon we could be as much as 75 better this weekend that shows how bad we were on monday but also tells you how much scope we have for improvement as well
4478133 hamilton have a good blend of youth and experience and a bunch of guys that look like they are desperate to do well and when that happens you always get a good response
4478134 both teams will be going into it in a positive frame of mind after positive results it is going to be a tough game for us
4478135 i was especially pleased with our togetherness the way we passed the ball and the way we competed against aberdeen
4478136 i was excited about the start of this season because of the way pre season had gone
4478137 i think the preparation has been excellent and i was confident we would start the season well
4478138 the boys are full of enthusiasm and have points to prove
4478139 one thing i can guarantee is that there will be no lack of trying on our part this season and we are not going out to play for a point we will try to win as we will do in every game this season
4478140 its always nice whatever league you are in to get off to a good start
4478141 fortunately we did the right things against united a lot of people said united didnt play well but i think a lot of that was down to the way we played

4478144 a substantial number of multicultural consumers dont have jobs with retirement plans
4478145 this is particularly true for hispanics almost half of whom are employed in the blue collar industry and dont have the opportunity to participate in these types of investment accounts
4478146 the good news is that multicultural consumers are building trust towards financial institutions and owning more financial products but there are still gaps that need be addressed
4478147 this is especially true in the subprime mortgage market which has hit multicultural consumers particularly hard
4478148 there are many cases of seasonal workers from mexico and other latin american countries not seeing their families in their home countries for several years as it has become more difficult to cross the border

4478156 it was disappointing not to start as youre always looking to be in the team for the first game of the season
4478157 but the manager said its going to be a long season and to keep my head up
4478158 ive been lucky and ryan oleary has been unlucky and ive managed to get back in the team and hopefully ill stay there
4478159 itll be a hard game but looking at the results from last weekend inverness winning hamilton winning and st mirren playing well its going to be a hard league this year and you wont get an easy game this season
4478160 math from a literacy perspective where we tie math words into our vocabulary
4478161 al deze kranten kregen geld omdat twee parlementari rs een verklaring tekenden dat hun krant een orgaan betrof van een politieke beweging die vaak niet eens bestond
4478162 principieel vind ik het juist dat kranten geen geld uit de staatskas ontvangen omdat de onafhankelijkheid van een krant met staatsfinanciering in het geding komt
4478163 maar waar het gaat om partijkranten vind ik het goed dat politieke partijen middels publicaties hun programmas bekend kunnen maken ook voor de co peratieve bladen vind ik het een slechte zaak dat deze subsidie wordt ingetrokken
4478164 een miljard alles bij elkaar opgeteld is het bedrag gestegen tot een miljard per jaar
4478165 de grote bedragen gaan naar de grote kranten zoals la repubblica en corriere della sera de kranten die het meest worden getroffen door deze maatregel zijn juist de armste kranten en de nieuwe regel maakt geen onderscheid tussen nepco peraties en de echte co peratieve projecten
4478166 er zijn echte kranten van echte politieke partijen echte kranten van valse politieke partijen en nepkranten van neppartijen
4478167 een begeleide ontmanteling van de subsidies waardoor een krant in drie jaar tijd onafhankelijk moet worden
4478168 het probleem kan niet gedeeltelijk worden opgelost er moet een einde komen aan het belangenconflict de verstrengeling van berlusconis politieke en mediabelangen het debat over de financiering van de kranten is in principe terecht maar het gaat om de enorme illegaliteit die aan de basis van dit probleem staat en juist dat verhindert dat het mogelijk is om deze kwestie op te lossen

4478177 net property taxes in wisconsin rose 5 7 percent in 2008 the largest increase since 2005 the year before the recent levy limits on municipalities and counties were imposed the new study notes that 2006 property taxes here were ninth highest nationally and higher than those in all surrounding states
4478178 from 1977 to the present south dakotas tax burden ranking has dropped 25 places from 20th highest to 45th primarily by maintaining a zero rate on individual and corporate income the tax burden ranking in arizona has dropped 24 places from 17th highest to 41st and the residents there now pay the tenth lowest tax burden most of the change came in the wake of a property tax limitation in 1980 and their ranking has changed little since montana has dropped 22 places primarily by maintaining a zero rate on general sales colorado has dropped 19 places in the ranking over the last 30 years it levies every major tax but the rate on each is among the lowest in the country spending discipline in the form of a so called tabor taxpayer bill of rights has helped the state keep tax rates low two politically liberal states have dropped sharply oregon and massachusetts oregon has done so by never enacting a sales tax dropping 16 ranks from 10th highest to 26th massachusetts has dropped 17 places by imposing a property tax limitation and keeping a lid on its personal income tax rate living down its taxachusetts nickname

4478181 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4478182 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4478185 the man who has no problems is out of game
4478186 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4478187 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4478188 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4478189 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4478190 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4478191 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4478192 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4478193 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4478194 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4478196 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4478197 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4478198 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4478199 my response simply was did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me
4478200 but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4478201 i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet

4478206 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4478207 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4478208 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4478209 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4478210 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4478211 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4478212 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4478213 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4478214 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4478215 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4478216 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4478217 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4478218 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

4478221 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4478222 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4478223 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4478224 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4478225 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4478226 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4478227 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4478228 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4478229 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4478230 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4478231 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4478232 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4478233 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4478234 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4478235 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4478237 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4478238 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4478239 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4478240 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4478241 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4478242 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4478243 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4478244 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4478245 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4478246 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4478247 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4478248 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4478249 who are open to doing something on the production side
4478250 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4478251 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4478252 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4478253 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4478254 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4478255 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4478256 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4478257 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4478258 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4478259 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4478260 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4478261 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4478262 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4478263 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4478264 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4478265 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4478266 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4478267 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4478268 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4478269 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4478270 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4478271 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4478272 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4478273 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4478274 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4478279 like i wanna sound like a big man ya know
4478280 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4478281 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4478282 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4478283 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4478284 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4478285 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4478286 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4478287 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4478288 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4478289 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4478290 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4478291 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4478292 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4478293 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4478294 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4478360 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4478361 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4478362 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4478363 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4478364 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4478365 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4478366 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity

4478496 yo digo que un partido contra brasil ser a fant stico para los juegos ol mpicos y para el f tbol es un cl sico que todos quieren jugar y que todos quieren ver pero para nosotros primero est holanda
4478497 sabemos que se va a hablar mucho por todo lo que significa un argentina brasil pero primero los dos tenemos que ganar para despu s enfrentarnos y los dos tenemos rivales complicados
4478498 no vimos mucho a holanda pero sabemos que es un buen equipo que juegan bien al f tbol y no hay dudas de que en esta instancia ser un rival complicado
4478499 llega la parte m s linda pero a la vez lo m s dif cil en esta instancia no te pod s equivocar porque si te equivoc s te volv s a tu casa sin nada
4478500 sinceramente continu mascherano espero que no nos equivoquemos y podamos seguir en los juegos ol mpicos hasta el final porque nuestro sue o es poder volver a ganar la medalla de oro

4478519 sinceramente hubiera preferido evitar al seleccionado argentino en esta instancia de cuartos de final porque cuando se juega a todo o nada es mejor no cruzarse con los buenos equipos
4478520 argentina es buen equipo y en cualquier torneo que se presente es candidato al t tulo
4478521 nosotros tenemos que hacer nuestro juego y estar muy atentos porque el seleccionado argentino tiene muchos jugadores desequilibrantes y son peligrosos
4478522 en cambio nosotros jugamos los tres partidos con todo y con tan poco tiempo entre un encuentro y otro se puede llegar a sentir
4478523 tiene muy buenos jugadores los que jugaron el mi rcoles demostraron tener calidad y todos los futbolistas son buenos

4478536 its a very different record for us but better different
4478537 the night before ozzfest august 9th we were in houston and it was cracking thunder and pouring down rain the following morning after a five hour drive i awoke at 9am in dallas to the sound of metal bands
4478538 its such a great club and there is the chance to fight for the championship and win cups here
4478539 when you join a club like rangers you cant expect anything but to win things
4478540 its time for that to change everyone here wants to be champions again and to bring happiness to the fans
4478541 i know the game in england and the uk already so im already used to the british game
4478542 he is a really good all round midfield player and he will help us a lot
4478543 hes very good technically and i hope he will come and improve us
4478544 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4478545 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4478546 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4478547 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4478548 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4478549 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4478550 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4478551 the squad is better but we now have problems on the left because we have lost john arne riise harry kewell and sebastian leto
4478552 we will see what happens in the future with that situation but clearly our squad is better
4478553 you have to be opportunistic when you have a squad like ours i would just like our olympic players back to help us but we will probably have one player in the final the rest can return soon
4478554 the age of the squad is much lower they are good players and can be a very good team for now and the future
4478555 our fans want a trophy every season they would want the league title the champions league the fa cup and the carling cup in that order
4478556 but if you asked me what i would prefer then i would say i agree with our supporters
4478557 to me it was little clownish for our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4478558 if anyone feels offended by it we totally apologise for it
4478559 i want to say that we have a great respect for the orient and their peoples some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4478560 whoever interprets something else from the photos has taken it completely the wrong way
4478561 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
4478562 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
4478563 to try and convert an affectionate gesture of a model group of sportsmen and women into racism is repugnant
4478564 the sheer stupidity of the spanish team photo does make me just shake my head
4478565 sin duda que es una sorpresa pero en el tenis un partido muchas veces se decide en pocos puntos indic nadal algunas veces pasa algo como esto lo lamento mucho por l pero as es el tenis todos pierden no
4478566 en los ltimos tiempos perd partidos que antes no perd a se lament el suizo no estoy a mi nivel necesito entrenarme m s y tambi n parar un poco
4478567 la confianza falla cuando los resultados son adversos y uno pierde partidos pero no son normales estos resultados mi juego y mi record son muy distintos estoy lejos de esos n meros
4478568 lo siento por l pero a mis hijos y nietos les podr contar un d a que le gan al mejor jugador del mundo hoy era mi d a

4478578 oke kamu boleh hitung sendiri setiap hari ayah bekerja sekitar 10 jam dan dibayar rp 400 000 dan setiap bulan rata rata dihitung 25 hari kerja jadi gaji ayah dalam satu bulan berapa hayo
4478579 kalau satu hari ayah dibayar rp 400 000 untuk 10 jam berarti satu jam ayah digaji rp 40 000 dong
4478580 sudah nggak usah macam macam lagi buat apa minta uang malam malam begini ayah capek dan mau mandi dulu tidurlah
4478581 maafkan ayah nak ayah sayang sama imron buat apa sih minta uang malam malam begini kalau mau beli mainan besok kan bisa jangankan rp 5 000 lebih dari itu pun ayah kasih
4478582 ayah aku nggak minta uang aku pinjam nanti aku kembalikan kalau sudah menabung lagi dari uang jajan selama minggu ini
4478583 aku menunggu ayah dari jam 8 aku mau ajak ayah main ular tangga tiga puluh menit saja ibu sering bilang kalau waktu ayah itu sangat berharga jadi aku mau beli waktu ayah aku buka tabunganku ada rp 15 000 tapi karena ayah bilang satu jam ayah dibayar rp 40 000 maka setengah jam harus rp 20 000 duit tabunganku kurang rp 5 000 makanya aku mau pinjam dari ayah

4478763 everything presented to me is holy and everything that i set before my face is holy and everything in my temple was covered in gold because what is given to me is not given in poverty and is not given to me in stinginess or in selfishness but it is given with joy and freedom and all throughout my word and who donated to the work of my hands men gave liberally and generously and joyously to the work that was set before them
4478764 and i say my children you also as holy unto me you are a work in my hands and i am fashioning you for a great work i am fashioning you for a great display for was not my glory seen in the splendor of my house and did not those who entered into the temple marvel at the greatness of their god when they saw the beauty of all the things i say when men see that you are covered with me they will also glorify me for they will see that you are holy that you are set apart unto me and that you are indeed a treasure in my eyes
4478765 why would i cause my people to be haggard and ragged and to be despised does that glorify me no my children you are a treasure unto me and when people see your prosperity they will see that i do bestow my goodness upon thee for my word says my goodness follows all those that believe does my goodness follow you do you believe that my goodness follows you then receive my goodness receive all those things that i delight to give to you for this is a new day and i will glorify myself through my people and my people will not be seen as beaten down and as as low as the dust but they will be seen as victorious and as overcomers they will be overcoming and strong and beautiful in this hour for my bride will be glorious
4478766 and i have called you to be fruitful and to multiply and this is a season of fruitfulness this is a season of multiplication and even though the world seems in the opposite and even though the world is passing away and the things of the world are drying up you are not of this world my children you are not of this world and you are to be fruitful in a barren land you are to be fruitful even as you labor with mens hands because you are born of my spirit and you are not of this world and the principles of this world do not apply to you because the laws of my spirit and of my kingdom is what you will walk in and what you will dwell in and what you will receive and the measure that you receive is the measure that you believe do you believe then receive my golden measure
4478767 my children do not be afraid to walk with me do not be afraid in this season of uncertainty for i am opening my hand in a new measure for you and you are not accustomed to the things that i am about to do i say to you i am doing new things in the earth and new things in your life but through these situations and through these circumstances you will see your true worth because i am revealing myself to you and within you as you emerge in this season
4478768 do not limit me by these things you only see beginning and do not grieve over the things that once were and that were prosperous and that were plentiful and that were fruitful for those things are passing away in your life do not look to the former seasons but look in my hand and see the new prosperity the new fruitfulness and the new effectiveness that you will step into for i have done a deep work in you i have done a very deep work in you and you do not yet see and understand the fullness of my plan
4478769 but i say i have much for you because there is a great work that i have for you to do and i have prepared you for the new measure allow me to enlarge you allow me to expand you so you can contain the great things that will grow and that will flow through you and to you you are not accustomed to the love that will come for you have walked a very hard path you have walked a very lonely path you have walked a very severe path at times but i say it was only to refine because the greater refining the deeper the mining
4478770 i say to you look within and see the wonderful things that i am bringing forth within thee for you are coming forth as precious gold and silver and many jewels because you have been willing to sit as students in my schools i say the refining has brought forth awesome mining but you do not yet understand the value of your worth but you shall you shall for i am bringing forth the treasures from within you and they will look nothing like the former measures and the former things that you have done in the past they will not look like anything so do not try and amass again do not try and re establish what once was
4478771 my children i desire fruitfulness i desire breeding in this hour for i am breeding you with new stock says the lord i am bringing new stock to you and you will breed and multiply in even a quadruple way this is a whole new day and a whole new level of effectiveness that i have begun but dont look back to see look ahead to see what comes to thee dont measure yourself by former standards measure yourself in me and see the day that is arising before thee
4478772 theres many lands coming theres many lands going theres many things and people but oh you cannot do it in the measure as before know that surely i have shut the door i have told you many times even four you cannot go through the closed door i say come and look and see what has begun for great treasure great wealth great joy is to explode through you oh it has been a desire and a hunger that you release the explosion that is simmering in your spirit
4478773 my children release it my children look and see the doors that are open before thee they do not look like much in your eyes right now but i say as you say yes you will see the very best do not measure your success by the satisfaction you get outwardly but measure your success by my pleasure within you inwardly for your true success lies in your pleasing me and not even pleasing yourself for when you are satisfied and feel fulfilled in what you are doing youre not pleasing me your fulfillment and your satisfaction comes from obeying me
4478774 but i say i am pleased and my gold is coming for i have deeply mined you and i have deeply refined you and now i am breeding that which i have sown so that you can come forth full grown my children do not look at the lack that you think you own but look at what i own and see that it is coming to you i have set you in the way do not deviate from the path that i have set before you it is a path of abundance it is a path of liberty it is a path of joy but dont measure it by what your eyes see and by what you knew formerly for you cannot measure what lies within by what lies without i have greatness and goodness for you and i am bringing you forth new and it will be greater than you could ever perceive but children will you just believe
4478775 i am stirred in my spirit this night i am stirred i am aroused and i have been so longing for this night when i could come and give you more clarity and more sight oh i am so excited to do the pleasurable things concerning you i am so excited to prosper you i am so excited to clothe you and to adorn you and to reveal and to reflect myself through you i am excited to be glorified through you for i take pleasure in you let me bring it to you wait and dont run wait and see the rising of the son this is a whole new day and you are going to serve me in a whole new way but it will be a pleasure for you as you see what i will do it will be pleasurable it will fulfill you and you will delight in what i have created from within
4478776 my children it begins what i have laid within it now emerges it emerges i tell you my children let me have my way let me bless you let me provide for you let me guide you let my wisdom counsel you let my spirit fulfill you and flow out of you in this new day for this is my golden day i will have my way
4478777 as for our independence and our movement to that goal no one can stop us we have this goal and we will go for it together
4478778 georgia has only been independent for 18 years and it has already had seven wars with us
4478779 what happened in tskhinvali and in south ossetia is exactly what we had told you before
4478780 we warned you we had told you that georgia would go to war but we were told that saakashvili is a great democratic person he would never do that he had promised that to the eu all those promises turned into blood and the death of people in south ossetia
4478781 the plan of attack on south ossetia and abkhazia had been developed carefully
4478782 where were you during the first minutes of attacks on south ossetia why did the representatives of the osce follow the representatives of the peacekeeping missions of georgia why did they leave south ossetia straightaway
4478783 as for the peacekeeping mission no georgian peacekeepers who escaped in a foul and mean manner and who were also shooting at their russian and ossetian counterparts will be present on the south ossetian and abkhazian territories
4478784 we need to establish a final legally binding agreement on non use of force that will be signed by sides of the conflicts under guarantees given by russia the european union osce or possibly under some other guarantees
4478785 i would like you to know and tell your people russias position hasnt changed we will support any decision on the status of abkhazia and south ossetia made by their people in accordance with the un charter and other international conventions we will not only support such decisions we will guarantee their enforcement
4478786 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4478787 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4478788 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4478789 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4478790 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4478791 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4478792 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4478793 complained that exxon mobil corp makes too much money and should be forced to give some of that profit to the government
4478794 the other day we learned that exxon mobil made nearly 12 billion last quarter to put it another way they made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank of gas

4478802 i would like to clarify that we are honored that he will continue as our full partner in control of ua
4478803 he is in the middle of one of the greatest careers our industry has ever seen and one that will continue at the top of united artists entertainment
4478804 in a joint statement made by mgm ua it was said that wagner would continue to be part owner of ua and that cruise and wagner will continue to work on film projects together
4478805 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4478806 but i always tell my sons follow your passion and ive got to follow that advice myself as much as ive enjoyed my time as an executive i have longed to return to my true love which is making movies so thats what ive decided to do
4478807 until now we didnt have a movie that was done but now we have a movie starring tom cruise that deserves the best possible play time

4478824 most of the issues of the developing countries are left on the sidelines because negotiations are concentrating only on the interests and differences between the major countries
4478825 of course you dont want to be left behind but you have to protect the market access first while you address the supply concerns
4478826 if you export unfinished goods you can even do it at zero tariffs but you try to add value and export finished goods you will not like it
4478827 how do we talk about industrialisation when four percent of our budget goes to agriculture
4478828 these are some of the things we need to put into perspective mr joseph mugambe a parliamentarian said a law whereby they tell us the positions before we go for negotiations or a fall back position should be put in place before that we shall be called fans

4478834 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4478835 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4478836 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy
4478837 we and many other nations see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called colour revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global legal nihilism

4478842 i certainly do not attempt in this book to pick up where your poor teachers left off and instruct you in poetry appreciation
4478843 the poet who writes free verse is like robinson crusoe on his desert island he must do all his cooking laundry and darning for himself in a few exceptional cases this manly independence produces something original and impressive but more often the result is squalor dirty sheets on the unmade bed and empty bottles on the unswept floor

4478845 the canadian dollar is rallying on the back ofbetter than expected manufacturing data
4478846 todays data certainly didnt hurt i think the otherpoint here is that the canadian dollar has been quietly holdingup better than some of the other currencies while the u s dollar has been recovering
4478847 the key concerns are over western economies perhaps more importantly emerging economies and predominantly china where growth has been slowing
4478848 we are really not that convinced of the long term dollar strength crushing commodities and being negative to commodities returns
4478849 certainly at the moment there seems to be a link between the two but we are not convinced

4478879 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4478880 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
4478881 yes there are political dynamics we are working to sort them out the government will assume a supporting role and let non government organizations support on the peace efforts spearhead the discussions for the problematic concerns we want to end the conflict that clearly claimed more than 120 000 lives
4478882 theyre telling the justices dont rule on this anymore were going to withdraw the moa ad so that there will be a renegotiation so this will become moot and academic
4478883 we oppose the grp milf peace panel memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain because it is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was any appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed many if not all of its provisions violate the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4478884 we further strongly oppose provisions in the moa ad granting the milf through the bangsamoro juridical entity bje exclusive ownership over the bangsamoro homeland and removing this area from the public domain
4478885 it inputs will be collated first it is premature to make an initiative while there is an oral argument in the supreme court we are studying the possibility but we are careful not to get into what the judiciary is doing
4478886 there might be something in the decision of the supreme court that will guide us on how to proceed with legal processes to give life to the intent of the moa ad
4478887 as long as there is openness on both sides and as long as there is goodwill and good faith on both sides
4478888 we should not be deterred by any result of the hearings or the decision of the supreme court
4478889 building blocks of peace in mindanao not just for muslims but for lumads christians and muslims
4478890 we believe that lasting peace in mindanao should be done within the territorial integrity of the philippines
4478891 for all intents and purposes any proposal for charter change even if its forced will be dead
4478892 if the constituent assembly has been convened it has plenary powers i dont think you can limit by law what the constituent assembly can take up
4478893 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4478894 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of the ltte has also engaged in forced recruitment
4478895 both sides to this long conflict have again shown that they will jeopardise the lives of thousands of ordinary people in the pursuit of military objectives
4478896 in the absence of independent international monitors lack protection and remain at the mercy of two forces with long records of abuse
4478897 i saw it was a very fast time but for us its no coincidence that they made the final and then raced so fast
4478898 getting the start today should bring in total confidence to the entire camp
4478899 whatever i know about seo a piddling amount unfortunately i learned between midnight and 2 00 am which is the only time i have available to teach myself about it
4478900 i think it would be the right thing to do
4478901 its a matter of will you take the time to go do it
4478902 the new income tax rates will be in effect for the entire year but most of us wont see that until we settle up when we file our tax returns in 2010

4478904 this project seeks to move the discourse surrounding math textbooks beyond what works toward helping teachers effectively use high quality instructional materials
4478905 while the choice of textbook is important i would argue that it is not nearly as important as critics or advocates of certain textbooks would have you believe

4478912 at any of these signs athletes should stop activity tell their certified athletic trainer or coach and go to a cool place and replenish fluids
4478913 there is a fine line of what to push through and what not to
4478914 no question the big problem with athletes is not eating
4478915 the ones who get in trouble with fatigue are the ones who havent eaten anything parents should make sure they eat a balanced meal before practice
4478916 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases
4478917 these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
4478918 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
4478919 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease
4478920 while we are awaiting the results from large clinical trials this information can be helpful to doctors and patients alike who are looking for circumstantial evidence regarding the role of psa screening
4478921 this research can be added to the body of literature suggesting that screening may reduce prostate cancer deaths
4478922 while the us preventive task force recommends against screening for older men these results and other published studies show that psa screening may be an effective tool in reducing the number of prostate cancer deaths
4478923 psa tests should be discussed between a man and his primary care physician while taking into consideration his overall health profile rather than his age
4478924 the blood pressure reduction was unexpected as this was not a trial to determine whether exercise would reduce blood pressure
4478925 clinicians will always decry not having enough time to counsel but a method of using a prescription pad with exercise recommendations as suggested in the study will help solve this quandary
4478926 to the fact that preventive health services do not practically reach a very high priority in our medical system
4478927 if someone becomes ill with a heart attack many thousands of dollars are spent without question but if a physician needs to spend time counseling patients insurers typically do not reimburse well for these vital services
4478928 it sets the benchmark for comparison with current studies and future studies
4478929 is very unfortunate as such counseling is inexpensive and recommended by the u s preventive services task force a very well respected organization of health prevention experts
4478930 this information can help guide hospitals in determining where to focus their efforts for addressing this problem
4478931 medication discrepancies at discharge are especially dangerous because patients are no longer being monitored consistently and may not recognize signs of medication problems on their own
4478932 with patients today on more medications than in days past the stakes are higher than ever before
4478933 knowing when and where to look for discrepancies will help hospitals prevent errors that could cause harm to patients
4478934 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
4478935 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
4478936 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
4478937 there must be susceptibility factors in the granule neuron precursor cell that predispose it to forming cancer so we now must try to understand what it is about this cell type that makes it susceptible to forming cancer in response to sonic hedgehog signaling this relationship between stem cells and oncogenes suggests a new point of potential therapeutic intervention
4478938 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
4478939 adolescents are faced with so many influences that contribute to smoking attitudes and behaviors to find that a simple household rule that bans smoking in the home has a meaningful impact on smoking attitudes and behaviors is somewhat surprising
4478940 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
4478941 these bans send a strong message to teens that its not okay to smoke and in the face of so many other external factors that may influence teens to smoke peers advertising a home smoking policy is one thing that parents can control to some extent
4478942 this is not socialized medicine it is basically the same system we have now in the form of medicare just more broadly applied
4478943 but about 20 percent of our residents dont have health insurance and that puts a heavy burden on our area hospitals and our network of social service providers
4478944 this vote is a major victory for those who want to see a more just rational and compassionate health care system in our state and nation the resolution makes it clear that managed care and other private insurance company schemes have been miserable failures when it comes to providing care or containing costs
4478945 we need to convince our lawmakers in washington that a more equitable and sustainable system of publicly financed care is possible not tomorrow but today
4478946 the people of austin have spoken we want single payer health care
4478947 as a physician i see the toll our broken health care system takes on peoples lives every day too often leading to their financial ruin unnecessary suffering early disability or death the austin city council by its vote today has pointed the way forward to a cure single payer national health insurance
4478948 in tennessee the number of uninsured dipped for two years then rose to levels higher than ever
4478949 and the plan proved to be unaffordable in the long term
4478950 according to the latest figures on massachusetts from the national health interview survey
4478951 the uninsurance rate has fallen by only 2 percent from 7 7 percent to 5 8 percent since the reform was passed while the plan is already 147 million over budget
4478952 politicians like to claim theyve passed bold health reforms but theyre afraid to rock the private insurance boat
4478953 so they keep pushing gussied up versions of reforms that have failed time after time our health care system is sick to death and our politicians keep prescribing placebos
4478954 its easy to build political consensus for expanded health coverage
4478955 they are so obviously unworkable that its hard to take them seriously

4478967 some things are so irreducibly complex that they must have been made by an outside force
4478968 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4478969 this commitment not only moves us forward in meeting our renewable goal its also a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector
4478970 utility scale deployment of pv photovoltaic technology may well become cost competitive with other forms of renewable energy generation such as solar thermal and wind
4478971 these market leading projects we have in california are something that can be extrapolated around the world
4478972 the topaz solar farm will grow clean electricity on previously disturbed unused farmland with low profile panels minimizing visual impact
4478973 its designed to be compatible with key wildlife species and avoid environmentally sensitive areas
4478974 we are now here with technology available now that will allow solar to take its place among central station power plants with wind geothermal gas and coal
4478975 what you are seeing here is the foundation of an industry that can deliver electricity cleanly cheaply and reliably than the fossil fuel alternatives
4478976 thats really good news because the department of energy predicts we will need 386 gigawatts by 2015 just to keep up with load growth this is a very large great leap forward in economies of scale this is the wave of the future

4478990 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
4478991 the researchers traced ascorbates anti cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumors normal cells were unaffected
4478992 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
4478993 injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain ovarian and pancreatic tumors
4478994 up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily
4478995 the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
4478996 in immune deficient mice with rapidly spreading ovarian pancreatic and glioblastoma brain tumors the ascorbate injections reduced tumor growth and weight by 41 to 53 percent
4478997 provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans

4479060 spain came out and played really hard you have to give them credit
4479061 it was a matter that our defense controls so much of what our offense does
4479062 spains a good team they came out really well in the first half
4479063 in the second half we came out defensively and took care of what we had to
4479064 stuff like that happens during a game when both teams are playing physical you just step up hit your free throws and move on
4479065 i had to get a little treatment on the side but once it got warm i was okay
4479066 for us this was a good game its what we wanted to have
4479067 it was great when spain made their run and at the end of the first half were sitting there with a five point lead to see how were going to respond in that situation

4479092 thus the growth in earnings from tea coconut and minor agricultural products negated the impact of the decline in industrial export earnings to some extent

4479158 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4479159 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4479160 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4479163 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

4479168 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4479169 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4479170 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4479171 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4479172 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4479173 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4479174 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4479175 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4479176 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4479177 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4479178 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4479179 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4479180 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4479181 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4479182 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4479183 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4479184 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4479185 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4479186 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4479187 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4479188 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4479189 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4479190 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4479191 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4479192 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4479193 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4479194 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4479196 the incredible and sad tale of innocent er ndira and her heartless grandmother
4479197 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4479198 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4479199 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4479200 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4479201 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4479202 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4479203 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4479204 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4479205 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4479206 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4479207 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4479208 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4479209 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4479210 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4479211 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4479212 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4479213 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4479214 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4479215 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4479216 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4479217 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4479218 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4479219 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4479220 i think its part of bobbys shtick that hes a bad boy but he wasnt really that much of a bad boy he was fun he was courteous
4479221 carnie really can cook shes amazing everybody got fatter when she was here not her she doesnt eat it she just cooks i went antiquing with maureen in asheville n c and shes an exceptional hostess
4479222 i got up here saw the place sat on the porch and had a glass of wine
4479223 it sounds a little corny but i felt like all right im home
4479224 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4479225 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4479226 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4479227 we miss her every day it doesnt get any easier
4479228 im disappointed but whether the sentence was longer or shorter would never have made up for what happened

4479240 we need to be careful not to tinker with something thats not broken
4479241 theres a lot of names youre trying to cover yourself get your team better while trying to prevent certain players from going through
4479242 i make a bad pitch it gets hit i make a good pitch it gets hit its frustrating at this point im just trying to fight through it

4479246 eight have sold year to date five homes are currently under contract with two of these new construction
4479247 small and many parents are very involved and happy with the teachers the village is charming with a nice array of restaurants werners is a great store that has everything from grills to blue jeans and theres a new mexican grocery store
4479248 i love that our local farmers market includes live music storytelling and yoga it is a brilliant mirror of this community
4479249 we couldnt have imagined a better place to live anyone looking to connect and make a difference in their community can find ample opportunity in hastings
4479250 the market is built on users not flippers or investors
4479251 we continue to have people rarely seen in rooms of this size
4479252 i think people are most attracted to the small town charm paired with a level of sophistication that is really appealing
4479253 and hear the crickets and see the stars its a very good balance
4479254 some people want a house with a fabulous mountain view you dont always get that with the older homes which are often built right off the street
4479255 for most and possibly all of the miraculous accounts given later there doesnt even seem to be the
4479256 the crab returning xaviers crucifix resonating with pauls miraculous survival of the vipers bite on malta in acts
4479257 theres a real sense of community here thats one of the things i love about the street
4479258 by choosing harlem we got more space for our money
4479259 we bought a shell and people told us we were crazy but today that same shell would be 1 2 million to 1 5 million
4479260 the streets are wide and theres not the same population density as the rest of the city
4479261 we dont have high buildings like other parts of manhattan and the quality of life is great people sometimes say that there is a new renaissance in harlem but there isnt the word renaissance assumes that the neighborhood is down and coming back development is continuing and harlem is evolving into a rich diverse vibrant community
4479262 now if we want chinese my husband gets it before he leaves the office and brings it home
4479263 im a much happier more relaxed person because of the warmth and friendliness of the neighborhood
4479264 at the end of july we still had 21 4 million cash on hand which gives us plenty of money in addition to our ongoing fundraising to prosecute a very active campaign in the month of august
4479265 by the end of august we will be able and happy to report that we have no more cash on hand in the old primary account that being said we will have access to over 100 million in the first week of september
4479266 we were blessed to be building in a beautiful setting and we built what we think is a beautiful house to match
4479267 the design was an a frame reminiscent of the adirondack look and that was the look we wanted to emulate
4479268 we fell in love with tobacco barn oak we went with vintage wood on the floor the walls the 25 foot ceiling the whole house basically we used it over radiant heat which some people advised against but its extremely stable it functions perfectly
4479269 wood that was used to support a factory barn or building was exposed for decades to a regular increase and decrease in temperature and moisture
4479270 in some cases the timbers from which the boards were cut have been slightly expanding and contracting for over a century in their previous installations radiant heat with its low temperatures and even distribution affects the wood flooring the same way but the impact is much less dramatic with antique or reclaimed wood than newly sawn wood because it has already been through this cycle for years
4479271 we knew we didnt want pine we have kids and dogs
4479272 we needed something tough and durable we ended up at dales looking through a tremendous variety but he made it easy to figure out what would work
4479273 as an architect i find it the most incredible resource
4479274 it doesnt get any more green than using wood thats already been cut wood that would otherwise be destroyed from an environmental functional or aesthetic point of view old wood is the greatest i used it in my own kitchen its more expensive than the cheapest strip oak yes but not that much different from the better woods
4479275 these trees will usually produce a top quality lumber which normally ends up in fireplaces or dumps what a waste
4479276 dale coined the phrase mushroom wood and now people search for it
4479277 its our most popular wood the mushrooms produce enzymes that change the wood turning it deep brown and rough its an ancient look it can be planed for a floor i can think of three new york restaurants with mushroom wood floors and beams
4479278 there is a boom in construction but it has been tempered by the malaise of the macro market
4479279 there are 25 condo projects in different stages of completion and there are 25 that are complete
4479280 central harlem is always cheaper because it is less convenient
4479281 its farther from the subway hamilton heights is one of the pricier places
4479282 no part of harlem hasnt been greatly improved but its hard to buy because you dont know whats for sale there is no multiple listing service
4479283 they all look alike and people shop around the only thing that distinguishes them is location
4479284 lady power ent o j viu n vai bombar de coisas bacanas porque a mulherada arrasa
4479285 ill tell you what id like to do id like to move out of the suburbs id like to move into new york city id like to do a combination of development and brokering

4479288 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4479289 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4479290 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4479291 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4479292 issoselarians have became in contact with the aidarians the civilizations settled on the continent to the south soon the explorers will find that life in the wild continent of aidaria is much more dangerous and challenging than on tamed issoselor
4479293 went wild for this tree house id built back in georgia
4479294 the japanese word daiku and the greek roots of the english word architect both mean chief carpenter so you could say im an architect in the literal sense of the word
4479295 its a very important tradition in japanese architecture to let nature into the house to see the tree in the wood
4479296 since all the pieces of wood have bends and curves there are more variations more complex angles and interconnected parts like a jigsaw puzzle everything is custom fitted
4479297 its kind of cool to be working with these old western frames and there are elements shared with joinery from the other side of the world
4479298 gosh i dont know son that was like 25 um 28 years ago
4479299 quiksilver has the potential to become an important brand in mens fragrance because its audience is large and the brand has strong roots culture and legitimacy
4479300 to promote understanding and cooperation between military forces of the united states and u s allies
4479301 it is not up to members of the clergy to lead social and political movements but of mature and professionally prepared lay people

4479309 gaki san can you give me half an hour to think about this
4479310 gaki san ive never been confessed to by a girl before heck ive never been confessed to by a guy before
4479311 ive thought about dating girls a few times but each time i thought about it i became scared of myself i had no idea if i was wrong for thinking those things so ive been ignoring it
4479312 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry
4479313 you are a very important person to me and i feel like i need to give us a chance
4479314 ill be your girlfriend for one week after that ill give you my answer is that okay
4479315 ahh risa chan good morning i arrived early so i thought that id get us breakfast
4479316 risa chan how long do you plan to stare at me
4479317 eri youve got a drop of maple syrup on your chin
4479318 i know that but isnt there anything that you want to do
4479319 well i was thinking since we dont really have to do anything today that maybe we could go for a walk
4479320 a walk sounds nice ive not just wandered around for a while now
4479321 i think that your role as the prince in the musical really rubbed off on you
4479322 shes probably annoyed that she has to come here today when she doesnt really need to
4479323 well ill leave you two alone for the next week i have something of my own to do as well
4479324 theyre like pools of diamonds sparkly pretty rare and unbeatable
4479325 well ill leave you two alone for the next week i have something of my own to do as well
4479326 theyre like pools of diamonds sparkly pretty rare and unbeatable
4479327 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4479328 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
4479329 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4479330 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4479331 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4479332 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4479333 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
4479334 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
4479335 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
4479336 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day
4479337 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4479338 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4479339 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4479340 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4479341 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4479342 we are on a lot more companys radar screens they realize elgin is a great place to do business
4479343 elgin is an ideal location to do business live and raise a family
4479344 its something thats working we have a lot of inquiries from businesses that are relocating
4479345 we have engaged a search consultant who has identified about a dozen suitable office properties along the i 90 corridor and we have determined that downtown elgin based on a number of factors including the available incentives could possibly be a great location for us
4479346 i think youll find that this is the real deal
4479347 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4479348 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4479349 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4479350 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4479351 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4479352 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4479353 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4479355 the intense action racing title scheduled for release this holiday will feature international movie star maggie q as the lead character in the big budget live action sequences that propel the games original story forward
4479356 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4479357 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4479358 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4479359 didnt really come up with the proper response at the time
4479360 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4479361 encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4479362 the party really sits as judge and jury in an election contest and so the losing candidate will contest the election they will be given time i presume to make their case the winning candidate will also be given time to make their case and the party has to determine what it wants to do
4479363 as recently as last year two republican candidates challenged primary results
4479364 state republican party officials says both matters were resolved without a full recount because either the candidate couldnt pay for it or because the committee ruled it inappropriate

4479371 campaign 2008 is starting to feel like a sunday school bible drill
4479372 were electing a president not a national pastor i dont see what good it will do for the american people to again hear the candidates spout pious platitudes about their favorite bible verses or how devout they are
4479373 candidates should appeal to the voters based on their qualifications for office and their stands on the issues not their religious beliefs
4479374 this event continues the campaign spiral into religious matters americans want to hear the candidates views on important issues such as constitutional rights public education the iraq war and the economy
4479375 if by thinking you mean fantasizing then yes were still thinking about leaving new york but no were not doing any planning
4479376 your parents must be hinting about that no any pressure
4479377 deborahs father told her shes too old to have kids
4479378 he told her they wont come out right theyll be retarded
4479379 but if you dont mind my asking how old are you deborah
4479380 oh no the old joke birthday card brutal but youre still young enough to have kids or you could adopt an art director i used to work with remember him jamie he recently left san francisco took a new job and moved back to new york hes mixing his baby batter with a doner egg and a surrogate mom and now hes having twins a boy and a girl a middle aged gay guy living alone in new york city suddenly having two kids talk about a lifestyle change
4479381 i love both my kids dearly and they add a whole new dimension to my life but there is something to be said for being free and unencumbered
4479382 speaking of which you guys have to come out to visit
4479383 we send you information about special events and every year on your birthday you can come in for free food
4479384 sorry i cant do anything about it today but next year
4479385 in other words she has to wait the longest of any of us
4479386 i have reached the final and that by itself is a triumph as there have been so many upsets in the tournament the pressure was immense but i kept my focus for most of the match
4479387 i couldnt sleep as the semi final preyed on my mind throughout yesterday and today but i was determined to make it
4479388 having won the first chong wei became impatient and started making mistakes
4479389 it was too wide a lead for me to chase and i felt i would stand a better chance in the decider
4479390 the final means so much to me i have sacrificed so much and this is firstly for me my coach needs it too for he has been a pillar and malaysia needs it because of the support i have been given
4479391 i know this and this is all the more reason why i will take whatever china throw at me
4479392 let them do what they want to do because i am in the final and i will fight the gold medal means my life and i wont chicken out malaysia can be assured of that
4479393 there were very few vacant spots along the shore as crowds waved from prescott park the portsmouth naval shipyard and along the sarah mildred long bridge
4479394 we have five ships with the four tall ships and our own gundalow this is history making for us
4479395 its an original ship and represents a time when people were not only fishing but were racing these schooners
4479396 my part of this project is connected with this word neighboring languages in the title
4479397 im supposed to collect material on the russian language that was spoken here before 1867
4479398 there are still some people here who can speak some of the language or at least remember some of the words and phrases
4479399 to put it roughly its like shakespearean language to you it sounds familiar but its not the language you are used to
4479400 many of the words we do not use anymore they are old fashioned they are obsolete they are archaic ive read these words in books but i never use them
4479401 when they brought this russian here and it was picked up by the descendents of these mixed marriages they brought their own features to the language
4479402 on the one hand it has an archaic flavor but on the other hand there are some innovations due to native alaskan languages
4479403 not all the people are ready to participate some of the them are reluctant
4479404 some of them are old some of them cannot hear very well they want quietness no strangers dont bother me i dont blame them
4479405 russian has become an important part of alaska history because russians dominated for many years
4479406 language is part of culture its part of how people view the world how people interpret the world you can see it through language
4479407 and before these languages are gone they should be documented at least for history
4479408 we should all make an effort to revitalize them because its very important for peoples self identity
4479409 people are different and they will be different and language makes one of these differences
4479410 unfortunately this language will soon become a museum item because it will be gone very soon
4479411 im tired of chasing my dreams im just gonna find out where theyre headed and hook up with them later
4479412 according to karma the girls are singing the flying of the cranes composed by the fifth dalai lama who is said to have been a sometime poet a prisoner sentenced to death is enclosed in a box and thrown into the river through the slats he spies two flying cranes and implores them to lend him the help of their wings asked if they did so karma shakes his head that prisoner was probably a romantic sort he says
4479413 there is no history only fictions of various degrees of plausibility
4479414 if i lie and say you took me for a friend patched together in my thin bones will you help me be cunning and noisy as the wind
4479415 the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive and unrealistic
4479416 i got no alibis cant even tell my usual lies
4479417 excellency its a natural lie to tell i beg you stop this now
4479418 i might come to the end of my life and find out everyone was lying
4479419 so we cheated and we lied and we tested and we never failed to fail it was the easiest thing to do
4479420 some folks get spiritual cause they see the light some cause they feel the heat

4479449 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
4479450 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
4479451 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
4479452 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
4479453 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
4479454 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
4479455 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
4479456 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
4479457 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
4479458 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
4479459 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
4479460 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
4479461 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
4479462 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
4479463 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
4479464 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
4479465 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
4479466 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
4479467 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
4479468 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
4479469 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
4479470 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
4479471 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
4479472 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
4479473 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
4479474 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
4479475 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
4479476 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
4479477 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
4479478 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
4479479 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
4479480 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
4479481 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
4479482 i figure well if somebody ended up at the front door saying im staying in your daughters room then my husband would know we had a guest
4479483 i think ill get something for sure and i was actually expecting when i was listing way back in june that it would be closer to convention day that something would come up
4479484 ill probably just keep the refrigerator stocked and if theyre up when im making breakfast getting on my way to work then ill gladly cook something for them

4479488 she believes theyll be together in future because elizabeths health concerns make it just a matter of time whatever hes said in her mind the clock is running we know this

4479497 not only sized up president bush humiliatingly well but precisely anticipated europes nonreaction while taking a perfect fit measure of georgias mercurial president
4479498 not only knew what he was doing he knew exactly what others would do
4479499 the months of meticulous planning and extensive preparations for this invasion that were covered by military exercises disingenuous explanations and maskirovka the art of deception the red army had mastered
4479500 the russians convinced us to see what we wanted to see
4479501 if i may be so bold there was another president
4479502 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4479503 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
4479504 lots of mothers dont know what to feed their children anymore
4479505 in the past it was good to be a bit fat because it was a sign of strength but now children are getting too fat
4479506 we need to find the right investments and regulations to encourage people to adopt a healthy lifestyle or we risk facing higher rates of death disease and disability and the related costs
4479507 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4479508 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4479509 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4479510 we have had to simultaneously fight the taliban build more than a dozen defensive strong points train new afghan national police and conduct civic action programs to win over the local population and were doing it our motto ready for all yielding to none says it all
4479511 nothing in the field manuals could fully prepare us for this but we adapt and overcome
4479512 to intimidate other neighbors such as ukraine for choosing to associate with the west and adhering to western political and economic values
4479513 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
4479514 that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both sen obamas and sen clintons names will be placed in nomination
4479515 an endorsement by powell could go a long way to attracting moderates and wayward republicans to the presumptive democratic presidential candidate
4479516 if powell endorses obama it will not only be a pr and momentum bonanza for the democratic nominee but the retired general will be touted as the man who put his credibility on the line for obama
4479517 the questions surrounding obama experience accomplishments familiarity with the military and national security issues connection to middle american values are all powells strengths if the retired general and former secretary of state says obama will do okay as commander in chief a lot of americans will exhale with relief

4479528 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4479529 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4479530 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4479531 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4479532 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4479533 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4479534 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4479535 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4479536 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4479537 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it
4479538 this relay might be what it all comes down to for eight golds
4479539 you dont want to be the one who screws that up i dont think we were going to leave china if anyone dqd us
4479540 its something kind of hard to forget which i guess is a good thing at the same time
4479541 i dont want to do something stupid i want him to have every shot that hes got
4479542 i had a cold for a couple days and i didnt tell anyone i dont know how it got out
4479543 but its no big deal i had to go out there swim a good pace placed a good time and its just a matter of getting ready for the final
4479544 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4479545 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4479546 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4479547 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4479548 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4479549 while pupils were at work she observed closely the pupils activities and provided necessary intervention so that they would not be out of the content scope eg when one pupil was looking at information about the frog
4479550 weve still got a lot of work to do and there really arent any jobs etched in stone
4479551 these guys are competing really for 53 spots that are difficult to make
4479552 this becomes difficult its serious for every one of these guys because they understand that on a given play a given series a lot can happen our job as coaches is to give them the best stuff give them the best script give them the best plan to allow them to play their best its thats time of the year
4479553 i heard if i kept doing what i was doing i could be an asset to the team
4479554 i felt i like i did enough to get recognized but ive got to get iinto these preseason games to show the coaches what i can do against other teams and what they can expect from me during the season
4479555 high school programs have supplied the fundamentals for players on almost every nfl roster over the years we are thrilled to be a part of this partnership and bring our resources to the lhsaa
4479556 partnering with the saints in creating the first ever lhsaa game of the week seems like a natural fit for all football fans
4479557 our member schools coaches and players will benefit from the many resources the saints have to offer

4479560 when saban got mad or something happened he would just spaz out flip out
4479561 figured it was about time to do an update so here is what we been up to
4479562 after our fall tour last year we took some much needed time off to sort our personal lives out during this period everyone kinda went their separate ways and pursued other goals and interests
4479563 johnny and james landed guitar teching jobs and have been on the road since darryl started jamming with other bands and friends jeff and justin formed thunderchrist a heavy stoner rock doom band from london
4479564 all of this happening just as our 2nd album is to be released
4479565 well our album released ending our contract with our former record label this essentially put us back to the beginning seeing as there was no longer any support from our label this made it impossible to tour in this day and age what a huge kick to the balls
4479566 just releasing our 2nd album and not being able to support it as you can imagine this set us back
4479567 we have a few new tunes written and they are sure to please we are also probably gonna be doing a few local shows in the coming months
4479568 the intense rain outside continues unabated and far in the distance the torn grey clouds merge with the earth obscuring any hint of a horizon a fitting scenery to a final act of ignominy i attended seven and a half funereal hours of meetings yesterday initially with celtic frost triptykon manager antje lange then including martin eric ain and celtic frosts accountant to discuss in detail the dissolution of most of celtic frosts business arrangements and the distribution of the groups remaining assets what an infinitely doleful and emotionally draining undertaking and one i did not ever wish to witness and yet one that was probably unavoidable
4479569 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4479570 i sure hope woody paige destroys this plaschke guy on around the horn next week
4479571 i did project believe with usada where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts and i have the results to prove it

4479594 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4479595 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4479596 we know when it touches us and he knew that so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4479597 should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards sportsmanship
4479598 but yes i did expect it a little more so in the olympics when were all competing under the banner of this event being to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries
4479599 that was heat of the moment stuff he hit it right at me
4479600 probably didnt want to hear an apology right away because i thought it was intentional when we changed sides he said sorry its part of the game you were on top of the game
4479601 i said okay thats fine its part of the game youre right move on and we did
4479602 i know him very well ive played him many times on tour he does everything in his power to win
4479603 usually its within the rules sometimes its bordering on gamesmanship
4479604 but hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that thats why its disappointing because he is a great player
4479605 i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played
4479606 if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4479607 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive cooperation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive cooperation for the future
4479608 we have the opportunity in our hands to show the world that not only individual institutions but also the entire financial sector can be successful within the framework of greater cooperation in tax matters
4479609 practice a culture of privacy that goes far beyond bank client secrecy in tax matters
4479610 our state is here for its citizens not the other way around
4479611 i would suggest that commodity prices are coming off because the dollar is going up but equally people have really got on board now with the fact that the world is not decoupling
4479612 it is clear that europe and asia are really starting to slow now and its not just the us

4479640 at the end of july we still had 21 4 million cash on hand which gives us plenty of money in addition to our ongoing fundraising to prosecute a very active campaign in the month of august
4479641 by the end of august we will be able and happy to report that we have no more cash on hand in the old primary account that being said we will have access to over 100 million in the first week of september
4479642 interestingly theyve come to the dbts via the recent brighter than creations dark several of them mentioning andrew mullers album of the month review in uncut and how his claims for the record made them want to test his contention that among other things here was a synthesis of lynryrd skynyrds authenticity and virtuosity the replacements whiskey sodden wit the social conscience of bruce springsteen and the righteous fury of neil young and crazy horse unanimously theyve been amazed that the record lived up to the advance billing which they had probably suspected was bluster and hyperbole they now cant wait to see if the band can deliver live which when i bump into some of the same people on the way out they all grinningly agree they do spectacularly
4479643 the drive by truckers or dbts as they are known to fans stay true to their southern american rock roots but sound just modern enough to gain a european following their shows are known for being alcohol infused three guitar playing rift inducing jam sessions tuesday night was no different with the jack daniels being passed between members and fans passing a cheeky smoke to the pretty drunk looking cooley
4479644 teresa said they let people leave their cars in the parking lot dont mind if they come in just for a weather report and get returning customers from all over the southeast including the band the drive by truckers who e mailed them after a tornado one time to make sure pops was alright
4479645 after leaving the drive by truckers rob malone moved back to the shoals to reform fiddleworms with russell mefford they released an album called year of the cock a few years ago browan lollar of jason isbell and the 400 unit did the artwork for that album i was interning at the nutthouse recording studio in sheffield earlier this year when jimmy nutt started mixing the new fiddleworms record i knew from the moment i heard the unmixed tracks that this was going to be a great album if you guys will look at your liner notes youll see that jimmy engineered jasons album sirens of the ditch he also worked beside david barbe on the dirty south jimmys a helluva engineer and producer the combination of him working with the worms came together to make a record that does muscle shoals proud
4479646 when russell mefford was a kid he thought the platform wearing tongue wagging members of kiss were like superheroes not only that they came bearing gifts temporary tattoos every record that you bought from them you got something from them he said mefford is lead guitarist and vocalist for shoals band the fiddleworms which satisfies their fans with t shirts and stickers thanks to gene peter ace and paul they also included temporary tattoos inside of their last cd

4479653 six months into this voyage as theyre about to reach the point of no return fire up the big engines and head for the star theyre headed for something has started going wrong with these virtual modules
4479654 its something that will unnerve them and something that portends serious trouble down the road for this crew
4479655 i could hold the epee but if you hit it i couldnt do anything
4479656 the victory is mine too it belongs to all of us
4479657 for me jean michel is an olympic champion just like the others
4479658 they should be equally compensated for the work they put in together for years and years
4479659 its not a grave injury and im happy that stefano could get a medal
4479660 we had good directions and i know the area so we found it ok but you definitely couldnt ask a chinese how to get here
4479661 he come home with a ton of stuff so he told us how to get here so we could find our own things
4479662 at every games there is a bilateral agreement with the host and the deal we were able to strike with bocog was just our marks at just this venue and just to our invited guests
4479663 its opened to licensees donors the reason this place exists is for the people we serve
4479664 we cant sell their marks and they cant sell ours
4479665 its kind of a territory thing if you go to the superstore you wont see any
4479666 so this store is almost like a free trade zone its common were not allowed to sell in any of our other venues it would be disrespectful to our host but were comfortable with the deal we struck
4479667 be honest do you think its too big to wear around my neck
4479668 so for torino we doubled our space to 400 square feet then we doubled our sales from athens and actually sold out early and i vowed it would never happen again
4479669 we want people who come in wave one to have the same experience as people in wave four whatever you want after you journey all the way over here we want to have it on hand for you which is why weve gone to pretty great expense to air freight items over that we were running low on
4479670 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4479671 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4479672 there is always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4479673 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward its never easy
4479674 many people including politicians and celebrities used to know little about the paralympics
4479675 there would be policies to even out the difference between economic development and environmental protection gradually but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4479676 the government has its usual practice whose nature wont be changed because of the olympics
4479677 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4479678 i feel that for the disabled in china it cannot be called discrimination but unequal opportunities but for now it is improving and the pace will pick up because of the paralympics especially in job employment

4479682 there is a lot of bitterness among ioc members towards mccain
4479683 several have come up to me and said that were mccain to be elected they would not be voting for
4479684 the ioc may have changed in many ways since he held his hearings but their attitude towards him and the rancour and the bitterness towards him runs deep
4479685 he rang me one day and he asked me to come over to his office
4479686 he asked me to lead the bid and i said i would so long as he answered two questions first how committed he was to the candidacy and he replied he was heavily committed and secondly could we sort out the problem over building the main stadium
4479687 this had been a crucial problem for new york when they bid for the 2012 games they came fourth and for our rivals for the american nomination san francisco
4479688 however we called on architects and engineers to come up with a plan and the architects especially produced an economically feasible plan
4479689 mayor daley wanted a diverse committee to reflect the different communities in the city he wanted us to emphasise the environment and green policies and that chicago was the most accessible city in the
4479690 it really boils down to how much you want it the games
4479691 i went along with it but then he left me blank
4479692 when do i need to do it where what to do as time went on we got together and got me into doing it
4479693 he wants to get in the game and i admire that about him
4479694 met de huidige opec productie ruim boven de verwachte vraag naar ruwe olie van de opec bestaat de mogelijkheid van een scherpe stijging van de olievoorraden
4479695 es una posibilidad pero para ser honesto reconozco que tengo serias dudas de que realmente se produzca hay muchas razones para ello especialmente desde el punto de vista pr ctico porque cada uno tenemos nuestras vidas particulares nuestras propias bandas y varias cosas m s de las que tenemos que ocuparnos de hecho el estar tocando en festivales este verano ya ha sido un gran paso al menos por mi parte y posiblemente despu s de estos conciertos todos queramos tomarnos alg n tiempo libre al comienzo de nuestra carrera dimos un mont n de conciertos pero ahora no vamos a planear un recorrido de gira como hicimos en el pasado porque esto lo arruinar a todo vamos a ver c mo funcionan las cosas y ya veremos de hecho alguien nos ha propuesto una peque a gira de dos semanas por los estados unidos y bueno algo as es mucho m s realista para nosotros que una gira completa de nuevo
4479696 estar a realmente sorprendido si llegara a ocurrir pero nunca digas nunca jam s supongo que yo soy el ltimo que tiene que necesita ser convencido pero michael amott y jeff walker est n mucho m s ocupados con estas cosas que yo adem s yo tampoco estoy demasiado involucrado en los planning de los festivales que estamos haciendo de hecho actualmente b sicamente me entero de los pa ses en los que vamos a tocar pero poco m s risas
4479697 when i look at the current direction of our country i see many things that could and should be better

4479720 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself

4479800 i think most people would agree that if you ask muslims today what do they feel like they feel like the jews of europe
4479801 i dont mean to equate that with the holocaust but in the way that it was legitimate almost and still is in some parts to target jews many muslims would say that we feel the exact same way
4479802 somehow theres a message out there that its ok to target people as long as its muslims and you dont have to worry about the facts and people will turn a blind eye
4479803 its almost as if you dont have to check your facts when it comes to certain people and you can just run with those stories it makes muslims feel like aliens in their own country at a time when we want to engage with muslims actually the opposite happens
4479804 because were tackling head on the people that we feel are at the heartbeat of this whole complex agenda not to have a dialogue with them would seem that we are apprehensive were scared were frightened so even if its appeasement in some quarters that is still a conversation that is not being had and needs to be had

4479946 to keep it simple let us confine our example to just two electrons the pointlike carriers of negative charge
4479947 according to quantum electrodynamics they do it by exchanging a
4479948 the question which is relevant to our purpose here is where does the photon come from it does not come out of one electron and lodge in the other as if it were a bullet fired from one rock into another the electrons themselves are unchanged except for their momenta rather the photon is created out of nothing by the strain of the interaction accord ing to current theory when the two electrons come close their waveforms interact either cancelling out or reinforcing one another waveforms are intimately tied to characteristics like electric charge and we could thus expect the charges on the two electrons to change but electron charge does not vary it is always 1 602 x 19 coulombs instead the virtual photons appear out of the vacuum and act to readjust the system the stress spawns them and by their creation is the stress resolved
4479949 so in his art and writing spare is putting us in the mood or showing by example what attitude we need to adopt to approach the angle of depart ure of consciousness in order to enter the infinite what pitch of con sciousness we need to gain success
4479950 one must beware making dogma for spare went to great pains to exclude it as much as possible to achieve success in his magic however a number of basic assumptions underpin chaos magic
4479951 chaos is the universal potential of creative force which is constantly engaged in trying to seep through the cracks of our personal and collective realities it is the power of evolution devolution
4479952 shamanism is innate within every one of us and can be tapped if we qualify by adjusting our perception attitude and making our being ready to accept the spontaneous achieving gnosis or hitting the angle of departure of consciousness and time is a knack rather than a skill

4479956 senate president pro tem don perata began wednesday saying he had made enough concessions to secure a budget deal with the governor and called for republicans to sign on
4479957 but the day ended with little progress as perata concluded that negotiations remained at impasse
4479958 were huddling now and trying to see what our next step will be perata told reporters wednesday afternoon
4479959 hours earlier perata described a compromise with gov arnold schwarzenegger that would temporarily increase the state sales tax by 1 cent and restrain future state spending
4479960 the spending restraints include a rainy day fund and a spending cap but not gubernatorial authority for midyear budget cuts if the economy nose dives the oakland democrat said
4479961 in the five hours between peratas two comments it became clear that republican leaders were not joining peratas call for a vote neither were assembly democrats nor schwarzenegger
