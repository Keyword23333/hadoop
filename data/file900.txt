9000000 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9000001 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9000002 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9000003 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9000004 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9000005 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9000006 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9000007 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9000008 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9000009 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9000010 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9000011 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9000012 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9000013 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9000014 une premi re explosion a t provoqu e par un engin suspendu un arbre d s que les policiers eurent quitt les v hicules deux autres explosions se sont produites sans faire heureusement de victimes
9000015 je consid re quun pays dans notre cas la russie capable de d fendre lhonneur et la dignit de ses citoyens de prot ger leurs vies de respecter ses engagements internationaux dans le cadre du mandat de maintien de la paix un tel pays ne sera jamais confin dans lisolement quoi que disent nos partenaires europ ens ou les tats unis leurope et les tats unis ne sont pas le monde entier
9000016 si certains tats estiment quils peuvent sacrifier leurs int r ts nationaux au profit des int r ts dautres pays leur prestige ne fera que diminuer quelles que soient leurs explications si les pays europ ens souhaitent servir les int r ts de la politique ext rieure des tats unis ils nen tireront gu re profit mon avis
9000017 no way would mccain pick a woman from alaska unless she was purer than caesars wife
9000018 i dont know but i will get back to you
9000019 how are my comments going to be used how much editing might be done and how do i stay on message
9000020 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9000021 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9000022 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9000023 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9000024 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9000025 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9000026 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9000027 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9000028 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9000029 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9000030 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9000031 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9000032 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9000033 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9000034 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9000035 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9000036 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9000037 just have a little cake with my children and watch come cartoons
9000038 very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9000039 it is not an indication of any health problems it is an effort to be unseen
9000040 no one is planning anything special he is just being quiet these days
9000041 i dont think our celebrities are real hot on how old they are getting why would a pop singer draw attention to the fact they are getting older
9000042 to really still be in the conversation in terms of music sales decades after your career started is the exception not the norm
9000043 it is hard to imagine any album ever dominating the conversation as much as thriller did
9000044 we are anxious and waiting for him to do something
9000045 i dont believe in it as a revenue source it might make a lot of people wealthy but i dont think its the best thing for the state of alabama
9000046 this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9000047 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9000048 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9000049 even though iraq is in a difficult situation we will give the palestinians the utmost care
9000050 i was born in iraq yet i am afraid of walking in the iraqi capital
9000051 its a crime committed against us by the palestinian authority
9000052 once this problem is solved they would be safe like other iraqis
9000053 in this country we have no hope and no future
9000054 to climb his way out of the real problem he has with women
9000055 the battle in this election will be very much among independent swing voters
9000056 sono disposto a morire per lebraismo ma non per i nazisti
9000057 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9000058 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9000059 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9000060 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9000061 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9000062 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9000063 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9000064 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9000065 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9000066 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9000067 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9000068 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9000069 this is going to be hilarious its almost as if mccain needed an escape plan and figured palin was the best choice to make that happen let the amusement begin as we watch mccain fumble even greater into absurdity
9000070 do you want this woman to be responsible for responding to the likes of vladamir putin
9000071 this is going to be hilarious its almost as if mccain needed an escape plan and figured palin was the best choice to make that happen let the amusement begin as we watch mccain fumble even greater into absurdity
9000072 do you want this woman to be responsible for responding to the likes of vladamir putin
9000073 you will still be able to upgrade to later ie8 builds as they become available but you wont be able to uninstall them
9000074 if you have xp sp3 on your system and uninstall ie7 your system would revert to the backed up older version of the ie6 files rather than the newer xpsp3 version
9000075 was then able to trace the entire course from the comfort of my home half a world away and find a similar route to train on back in boise

9000079 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
9000080 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship

9000084 mindset and i contend there is no difference in the mindset at all i notice now that average americans can no longer afford to drive these kinds of vehicles so they are dumping them just like europeans in similar situations
9000085 lo que yo pienso es que permitir experimentos con electricidad o con elementos qu micos peligrosos es irresponsable pero igual toca hacer una investigaci n exhaustiva

9000091 if he was clutch would his ops be 484 in games the team loses and over 1 000 in games they win if he was clutch wouldnt he be better with two outs 259 ba than with none out 323 ba in 15 at bats with the bases loaded hes hitting 375 with 15 rbi with men on second and third hes only batting 091 with 5 rbi
9000092 obviously im well aware that i wasnt the most popular pickup in calgary flames history
9000093 but at the same time i think youve got to give it a little time and give me a chance if given the chance i think i can perform and help this team out
9000094 im in as good a shape as i can be with my knee
9000095 ive got a little ways to go im not going to fool anybody but my doctor did as good a job as possible to get me ready

9000104 i have no doubt that his makeup in this case a definable disorder led him to commit this crime
9000105 honestly when i saw this first i thought it was something to do with april fools day
9000106 i have found that on this subject much more so than politics people are either on one side of the fence or another no wishy washy sentiments here
9000107 amputation gasp or a unique and unwieldy new repair called the ilizarov technique so of course i chose the latter
9000108 the agreement i sent over we had agreed neither to admit or deny a violation make restitution and for sgt garcia to retire dec 8th 2008 his 22nd anniversary as a police officer at this point that was rejected
9000109 i can tell you that when the rochester police department did an investigation they decided to file charges
9000110 when they file charges it is our duty to prosecute them
9000111 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9000112 sarah palin is an exciting choice by senator mccain she completes a strong ticket that will bring a real record of change and reform to washington
9000113 governor palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party she is a strong defender of traditional family values with an unquestioned commitment to protect life governor palin knows we must aggressively pursue american energy sources like offshore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
9000114 sarah palin will make an excellent vice president the mccain palin ticket has the right solutions to secure americas future senator mccain and governor palin will help us win the war on terror lower taxes increase american energy stop wasteful washington spending secure our borders and give americans more choice and freedom with their healthcare and retirement
9000115 both mccain and palin are known for their achievements obama and biden are known for their smooth talk americans know that talk is cheap mccain palin is a winning ticket for republicans
9000116 adamantly supported our cause since i first understood as a child the atrocity of abortion
9000117 i believe in the strength and the power of women and the potential of every human life
9000118 the closer you get to fetal viability the more that changes
9000119 there is sanctity of life from conception until natural death

9000127 weve been stale we havent been able to get the big hit we havent been able to make a big pitch
9000128 i dont care about the first two games this one hurt
9000129 we played our hearts out we lost a really tough game
9000130 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
9000131 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
9000132 my plan was to be part of the olympic games and i knew that if i suffered from pain they would have to operate this isnt something that took me by surprise
9000133 this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9000134 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit

9000138 i think teams who have deficits should be kicked out of
9000139 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
9000140 uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled
9000141 it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons
9000142 every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
9000143 i buy the players i feel strengthen the squad after that i consider the price
9000144 i do the job i think it has to be done considering the resources of the club and considering our ambition and the players we have
9000145 i know the media and supporters sometimes too are happy with big numbers but for me what is most important is big quality sometimes both are linked but not always
9000146 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
9000147 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
9000148 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
9000149 we are out to look if we find the right players we will do it one or two
9000150 shinji rarenai oh unbelievable and i had to apologize her for the act of my friend ha ha ha
9000151 ashlee broke down in tears at a doctors appointment in early august when she found out shes gained more weight than is considered in the healthy range
9000152 she cant wear them now but she hopes it will give her the incentive to watch what she eats
9000153 i cant wait to be a mom and he cant wait to be a dad so its fun
9000154 hes so awesome its fun to have somebody that i love to do this with
9000155 my mom and my grandmother have given me good motherly advice
9000156 but its one of those things where your mother instincts kind of kick in right away
9000157 i dont think its something well decide until the baby comes
9000158 since my arrest it has been extremely stressful both personally and financially
9000159 the sadness and despair in my mothers eyes is worse than any jail cell you may put me in
9000160 i am a bigoted greek in the condemnation of the roman architecture
9000161 o ur religion requires a church wholly different from the temple our legislative assemblies and our courts of justice buildings of entirely different principles from their basilicas and our amusements could not possibly be performed in their theatres or amphitheatres
9000162 this is about a b average which is much lower than expected given that we live in san francisco
9000163 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgement it shows political panic
9000164 the most awful thing for an upper limb reconstructive surgeon to do is to remove an arm its a dreadful thing to do
9000165 but by using the bits that would be discarded you can pluck a little bit of comfort
9000166 we are delighted tom is making a good recovery and that he is pleased with the outcome of the specialised surgery undertaken by the team here at leeds general infirmary
9000167 we wish him well and look forward to seeing how he is progressing on his next visit
9000168 i was very upset at losing my arm but then the prof told me what he planned to do

9000211 my office mates think im a little bit crazy but in many ways part of the reason i do this is to encourage other people to cycle
9000212 the vast majority of the people i work with dont live 90 kilometres from work they live nine kilometres from work so they have no excuse get on the bike and bike to work
9000213 on the highway its really obvious that im little old me going fairly slow and not weighing very much and everybody out there is very fast and weighs quite a bit so that creates a respect out on the highway that mitigates a lot of that risk
9000214 the interesting thing that happens as soon as you hit the city is that the concept of mutual respect between cyclists and drivers tends to get lessened just a little bit
9000215 on a place like portage avenue im in the slow lane and sometimes motorists provide me half of the lane and sometimes less than that so sometimes cars pass me with just inches to spare or a foot or two at most so its just that proximity that makes it dangerous
9000216 basically we didnt really build the city for bikes the first time
9000217 if you dont build it right the first time to go back and fix it is difficult but you know i think thats the direction we need to go

9000337 obesity is really affecting the population as a stakeholder in this society we have to do something
9000338 its already an extremely serious problem considering that heart diseases and strokes are the number one killer
9000339 the prevalence of obesity in the gulf states is among the worst in the world
9000340 its very dangerous they could end up spending fortunes treating the side effects of obesity

9000343 but we ask that all political parties refrain from baseless speculation on the incident whose circumstances remain unknown
9000344 it seems that poor advance co ordination between the army and the resistance about the helicopters overflight led to the confusion

9000374 he will continue and enhance our nations commendable global leadership in an area in which i am deeply involved the fight against aids tuberculosis and malaria including and this is very important a renewal of the battle against hiv and aids here at home
9000375 it was disappointing that on the occasion of this historic nomination that one of the greatest health threats facing america today was not more front and center during this years convention
9000376 this is my fourth democratic convention and it has never been so difficult to put hiv aids on the agenda at a time when the aids epidemic is worse in our nations capital than in many parts of sub saharan africa how can aids not be a featured as a priority by our democratic presidential nominee
9000377 disappointed that there was not a specific call to action by the presidential or vice presidential nominees to end the aids epidemic in america
9000378 obama has been a leader on hiv aids here in illinois and i hope that he will continue to personally address the issue during this presidential campaign his direct involvement and leadership remains critical
9000379 lately weve recognized it is a problem in other countries but while weve been tackling aids overseas weve forgotten about the home front
9000380 its time we demand better results from our domestic response to aids
9000381 that is why senator obama has called for a national aids strategy we have to have a plan of action to tackle aids in america
9000382 a national aids strategy has to focus us on achieving concrete outcomes including bringing the hiv infection rate down and increasing access to care
9000383 a strategy has to better coordinate the work of federal agencies and use resources most effectively and it has got to move us away from basing health policy on conservative social agendas and instead design programs based on what works like comprehensive sex education condom promotion and needle exchange

9000393 le conseguenze dei controlli possono colpire anche persone innocenti nel 1998 al tempo dei fatti della bank of new york perch un conto venisse congelato bastava che il possessore avesse un cognome russo abbiamo oligarchi corrotti ma ce ne sono anche di onesti
9000394 non si parla qui di interruzione delle forniture ma per esempio di progetti futuri che faciliteranno alla russia la distribuzione di petrolio e gas in europa il gasdotto settentrionale south stream lacquisizione di reti di distribuzione di gas in europa queste misure sono perlomeno tecnicamente fattibili riguarderanno 5 6 imprese una decina di progetti ma controllare ogni singola compagnia che ha acquisito qualcosa in canada o negli stati uniti solo per quello che le autorit russe stanno facendo a livello di politica estera una cosa che esce dal senso delle proporzioni sarebbe una dimostrazione di impotenza di isteria da parte delloccidente
9000395 anche gli stati uniti potrebbero subire delle perdite adesso i soldi dei nostri oligarchi sono impiegati da loro e possono cominciare invece a essere impiegati in russia o in un altro paese gli attivi possono tornare in patria andare in europa in cina negli emirati arabi dov pi comodo e invece dei nostri oligarchi dovrebbero leggere quellarticolo proprio gli americani per cominciare a riflettere sul da farsi
9000396 in 2006 there was a similar campaign to the current one in brazil in argentina
9000397 the presence of hcg in various samples of the vaccine used against rubella were discovered the suspicion that brought about the investigation was caused by the fact that there were very few cases of the disease in argentina which didnt merit a large scale campaign
9000398 the age of the people who will be vaccinated is 12 to 49 years for women reproductive age and between 12 and 39 for men
9000399 the ages for women are the same as those who received the vaccines in nicaragua where they included a hormone that sterilizes the woman who receives it and similar to the age of those who received another sterilizing hormone in the philippines
9000400 if the campaign goal is really to eliminate rubella then why vaccinate those already vaccinated
9000401 why compel the vaccination of those that had the illness in the past it is a fact more than proven that an individual who has had rubella in the past will never have it again
9000402 all girls feel too big sometimes regardless of their size
9000403 that kind of shock where they cant even stop their mouth to think that a human being is going to be the recipient of their reaction
9000404 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil
9000405 because there is always one seat left right at the back and as you are walking down everyone stares i feel very self conscious and then you have to get into your seat with your knees wrapped around your neck
9000406 for the legroom its not my fault that i had to buy it but i am getting taxed extra on it
9000407 because you do get picked on its just a fact
9000408 people make comments when they are standing right next to you as well as staring you think im tall but im not deaf
9000409 when it comes down to it its personalities that matter
9000410 we would hold hands in public and you feel silly you shouldnt but you do
9000411 i do like being able to look up to him
9000412 a part of me that married him because i didnt think i would find another tall man so it was a good thing that i did love him
9000413 i do think that its harder to be a tall woman than to be a tall man
9000414 because for a man its easier to find a partner
9000415 are generally more successful in life in areas including salary and winning presidential elections but this doesnt happen for women the chances of marriage and children are higher for taller men but the reverse is true for women
9000416 in the playground of life tall men get used to being deferred to because they can thump hardest whereas the womens world is much more collaborative and network y and physical strength is much less of an advantage
9000417 tall men tend to be more symmetrical and have better chances of reproductive success whereas it is short women who tend to be more symmetrical to get married and to have children
9000418 and the moment you perceive yourself that way other people perceive it too
9000419 i also also think that women blame a lot of their issues on being tall when that two or three or six inches are not that important if you were 5ft 8in you would have all the same problems it is an easy hole to fall into
9000420 everything to do with peoples perceptions of what femininity is
9000421 aged 12 i was the tallest in the school which i didnt like but i soon learnt that tall is in fact an asset no matter what i put on it looked good
9000422 men ask me to dance but when i stand up they start to back off saying maybe some other time thats when i grab em and say theres no time like here and now fella
9000423 with ethan hawke and angelina jolie theres a sex scene where they f on a dresser thats insanely titillating looks real all the sex in our movie none of it looks like that its a comedically drawn caricature of not just sex but porno sex we live in the age of the internet if teenagers wanted to be titillated its not going to be by this movie its going to be some hard core pornography that seemed to work
9000424 how much more money can we squeeze out of people
9000425 boy i was a little wild in my younger days but boy did i have a blast

9000494 an internet troll or simply troll in internet slang is someone who posts controversial and usually irrelevant or off topic messages in an online community such as an online discussion forum with the intention of baiting other users into an emotional response 1 or to generally disrupt normal on topic discussion
9000495 the basic mindset of a troll is that they are far more interested in how others react to their posts than in the usual concerns of accuracy veracity comprehensiveness and overall quality
9000496 trolling is a game about identity deception albeit one that is played without the consent of most of the players the troll attempts to pass as a legitimate participant sharing the groups common interests and concerns
9000497 trolls can be costly in several ways a troll can disrupt the discussion disseminate bad advice and damage the feeling of trust in the community

9000500 but i didnt so i got no sense of humor anyway
9000501 how could you say the car would cost 65 000 to build when the battery pack alone cost 20 000 well thats because
9000502 4 the home charging units cable has a break away design so that if you managed to yank the cable clean off no dangerous voltages are exposed
9000503 the share of family income devoted to fixed expenses like rent has increased from 53 to 75 in the past two decades housing prices in most major metropolitan areas have risen six times faster than household incomes and household debt has ballooned to over 130 of disposable income
9000504 the process we ultimately adopted for our body panels is resin transfer molding rtm
9000505 the painted body panels are built with a low pressure injection molding process
9000506 you just cant bail all these people out and excuse their bad decisions whatever
9000507 but lordy lordy how would we ever pay for it all
9000508 and or tax the rich amp corporations more close loopholes
9000509 unless your credit card is denied at the charging station then you receive a tazer like shock

9000511 wow it sure seems like lotus is borrowing design cues from tesla now
9000512 and then theres this at high currents ultracaps have much worse efficiency than batteries somewhere around 60

9000519 it is intended to be divided equally as the minister noted
9000520 we recognize that from one day to the next the absolute amount of time on a particular task may not be exactly equal
9000521 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature
9000522 so yeah they spend a lot of time there but not on the plant floor he doesnt even spend all his time at that maple leaf plant dealing with that plant
9000523 every one of them is afraid of being fired if they do
9000524 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
9000525 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
9000526 i think that it should be investigated at the nursing home but i think the plant in which all this has developed it certainly should be checked into very very thoroughly
9000527 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
9000528 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major major consumer issue
9000529 they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
9000530 if they dont find out how do i know that next month its not going to happen again or with some other products more care has to be put into how our food is prepared
9000531 it is intended to be divided equally as the minister noted
9000532 we recognize that from one day to the next the absolute amount of time on a particular task may not be exactly equal
9000533 the important message for people is that if you have the symptoms that are associated with listeriosis that you take precautionary actions as you see fit in terms of seeing a health professional or public health person
9000534 because we knew we had made those products we had removed them from sale when the recall was initiated
9000535 we executed the recall we did it effectively efficiently and the products that are now being recalled were prepared and sold prior to the recall
9000536 if theres a problem with a product we pull the product off the floor and begin calling our customers and typically within 24 hours everyones been called
9000537 the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
9000538 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
9000539 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
9000540 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
9000541 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
9000542 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
9000543 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
9000544 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
9000545 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
9000546 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
9000547 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
9000548 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
9000549 it took decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the drug
9000550 about 50 per cent of an inspectors time is spent on the floor of the plant the other 50 per cent is overseeing paperwork most of it scientific in nature test results and the like
9000551 were concerned with the safety of the food supply and canadian consumers
9000552 there is no valid argument whatsoever that theres been cuts to the canadian food inspection agency
9000553 one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but we can always make it better
9000554 thats why were investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and have already hired 200 more inspectors with more to come
9000555 there has to be a shared responsibility there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible
9000556 through this particular crisis we will evaluate everything we learned from it and make sure the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
9000557 this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
9000558 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully we have and we continue to improve on our action plans
9000559 youre racing from place to place doing the paperwork and how much time does that realistically leave you to do inspection activities
9000560 even if your manager has the sense to tell you to use your discretion and judgment if you think you want to take a quick stroll through the plant youre often not going to have the time to do it anyway
9000561 theyve moved to a paper system whereby industry basically regulates itself so the big loss in terms of front line inspection happened long before the conservatives came onboard
9000562 the conservatives are simply doing another round in the same direction
9000563 we will not restart the plant until this investigation is complete and ive signed off on it personally
9000564 the toughest situation weve faced in the 100 years of this companys history
9000565 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9000566 but the failure to respond is a direct result of broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9000567 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9000568 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
9000569 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president
9000570 in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9000571 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
9000572 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
9000573 and i will restore our moral standing so that america is onc e again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future

9000580 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
9000581 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9000582 those who are preparing to divide us the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes
9000583 well i say to them tonight theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
9000584 i can see how the person she is today was formed in the experiences we shared growing up working hard studying hard having parents who wanted more for us than what they had and always being reminded that in this country of all countries those things are possible
9000585 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig it was the greatest gift a child can receive never doubting for a single minute that youre loved and cherished and have a place in this world and thanks to their faith and hard work we were both able to go to college
9000586 from their lives and mine that the american dream endures
9000587 his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
9000588 all too often we accept the distance between the two and settle for the world as it is even when it doesnt reflect our values and aspirations but he reminded us that we know what our world should look like we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like
9000589 in this country of all countries those things are possible
9000590 there will be more itll probably be more like 40 billion
9000591 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9000592 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
9000593 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
9000594 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
9000595 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
9000596 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
9000597 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
9000598 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
9000599 he got into the files just yesterday so we wanted to have him on to find out what he found and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
9000600 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well
9000601 were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
9000602 will put the interests of black americans ahead of other americans
9000603 theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
9000604 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home
9000605 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
9000606 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9000607 i watch with amazement as he came to the senate i watch with amazement
9000608 made his mark literally from day one reaching across the aisle to pass legislation to secure the worlds deadliest weapons
9000609 to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
9000610 but i was proudest i was proudest when i watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of americas wounded warriors at walter reed army hospital
9000611 what hes done in the united states senate fighting to ensure that the men and women who serve this country are welcomed home not just with medals and parades but with good jobs and benefits and health care including mental health care
9000612 we will end the tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas and we will give those breaks to companies who create good jobs with decent wages right here in america
9000613 pay at least 60 percent of each employees health care premiums
9000614 maintain or increase the number of full time workers in the united states relative to the number of full time workers outside of the united states
9000615 not less than an amount equal to the federal poverty level
9000616 raise the cost of capital of u s multinationals and cause them to lose market share to foreign rivals
9000617 tropical storm gustav was back in focus despite reassurances from the iea international energy agency and the us department for energy that they were ready to tap into emergency oil reserves in case the storm causes significant supply disruptions in the gulf of mexico
9000618 the focus is likely to remain on tropical storm gustav and potential supply disruptions during the weekend and earlier next week
9000619 we still have to worry about the hurricanes effect on this market
9000620 the operation had an extremely successful outcome when a clandestine print shop was raided while counterfeits of 200 and 500 euro denominations were being produced
9000621 in addition machinery and other equipment used to produce counterfeits were seized as well as smaller amounts of counterfeit us dollars and colombian pesos
9000622 natixis is ready to write a new chapter in its history
9000623 we have suffered the consequences of this crisis which surprised natixis in the very first months of its existence
9000624 we now find ourselves with a ton of shares that are no longer worth anything
9000625 this proposed project offers timely and economic access for shippers to the u s gulf coast market
9000626 the new system would be a continuation of our phased approach to gulf coast market access which has the objectives of minimizing capital cost and financial commitments required of shippers maximizing use of existing pipelines and rights of way and ensuring attractive producer netbacks
9000627 management remains perfectly neutral with regard to all possible buyers and will make every effort to secure a deal with the partner who can offer the best long term perspective for the privatisation process

9000631 the two worked together for barely a week after which mccain accused obama of partisan posturing

9000653 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9000654 jason is a massive muppets fan and is seen as the man to finally bring the muppet show back to tv
9000655 it will obviously have all its old fans but jasons comedy is hugely popular with youngsters so it will open it up to a whole new audience

9000665 it is not an indication of any health problems it is an effort to be unseen
9000666 no one is planning anything special he is just being quiet these days
9000667 moscow has laid the foundations for the occupation of crimea with years of careful propaganda its like hitlers excuse of helping the ethnic germans in the sudetenland as justification for the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1938 i have no doubt that now that the georgian conflict is over russia aims to take over crimea the level of hatred against anything ukrainian here is astonishing many people have been attacked in the street for merely speaking ukrainian you can talk french german or chinese here without problems but if you speak ukrainian people often come up and start insulting you

9000818 sarah palin is a tough executive with a bipartisan record of accomplishment in shaking up government in her home state
9000819 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
9000820 this was a wonderful surprise to me and the whole country i dont know her well but from what i just saw in her first speech im ecstatic
9000821 what i liked about it was her poise and her confidence i think thats where everybody was waiting if she was the next dan quayle and clearly after seeing that shes not
9000822 to her credit sarah mentioned ferraro and hillary in her comments
9000823 its wonderful that the republican party can grasp this sentiment in our country and hopefully be the ones to make history with it
9000824 she has every bit as much experience as barack obama does and she has executive experience which he has none of his entire focus has been on running for higher office
9000825 i think its a very evenly split ticket on both sides one green person and one veteran of politics on each ticket

9000832 the market is just very fragile theres not a lot of support going into the labor day weekend
9000833 the dell news has compounded the downside move when you have a non financial company missing its earnings thats disconcerting to the market
9000834 the dollar is up and so we are seeing prices of crude move down from the highs remember that in 2005 the market sold off hard before hurricane katrinas arrival and then rallied again when it hit
9000835 right now there is still uncertainty on where exactly gustav will hit and so it is difficult to determine the damage that the storm might bring
9000836 it may be four days before it actually hits the gulf coast and the forecasts show a wide area where it may hit so some people are positioning some are repositioning ahead of the long weekend
9000837 places like redzikowo or slupsk perhaps will arouse more interest in the event of a conflict

9000858 i was disappointed to see a great champion like him not make the top 10 in valencia during the european grand prix on august 24 where he retired on the first lap
9000859 he is motivated and we must work hard so that he is in a position to make a quick start
9000860 especially on the new circuits which i dont like and are doing harm to formula one you cant overtake and nine times out of 10 whoever takes pole position wins
9000861 this is a bad experience that should have been avoided
9000862 too scary too early and as it turns out not particularly accurate very damaging
9000863 but we also want somebody to think of the economy before they pull a trigger
9000864 based purely on speculation recommendations that have this sort of impact should probably be based on hard data not guessing
9000865 in an abundance of caution and without having the benefit of testing the beach water after the severe weather event the broward county health department issued a beach water advisory to protect those who might be most vulnerable in this situation

9000873 when i wrote choke i was struck by how fantastic evil things can be discussed in banal language
9000874 the film expanded upon that idea everything in the film is true
9000875 sarah palin is better without a teleprompter than obama with one
9000876 congratulations governor palin we look forward to a spirited race
9000877 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9000878 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9000879 for someone who has never spoken before a national audience in the most challenging moment of her life sarah palin is displaying a kind of comfort that is well obama like

9000890 and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9000891 our revolutions main mission is to pave the way for the reappearance of the 12th imam the mahdi
9000892 today we should define our economic cultural and political policies based on the policy of imam mahdis return
9000893 the publics increasing interest toward the jamkaran mosque in coming years
9000894 its a little like sailing the flying dutchman through the fog
9000895 no the guy who takes photos of a thousand nude people in mexico is an artist suicide girls is pornography
9000896 its about being able to look your children in the eye or in my case my children grandchildren great grandchildren great great grandchildren and great great great grandchildren the youngest of whom are nearing retirement
9000897 the election comes down to post boomer versus pre boomer its so outside the mold
9000898 boomers are in their high electability years this is prime real estate
9000899 raises the question of whether the public was kind of turned off by the boomer sensibility
9000900 the capstone of this was world war ii and a tremendous collective struggle
9000901 gen xers have made a career of skating lightly and making themselves over
9000902 these are kids who dont remember the john f kennedy assassination who dont remember the american high

9000911 i needed to be here i needed to do whatever was necessary
9000912 to me this is one of the most exciting times
9000913 this could be one of the biggest nights of our lifetime
9000914 the fact that were the host town makes it even more
9000915 you can be a student filmmaker a professional or an amateur it doesnt matter
9000916 you can make it animated you can use live actors you can make a musical or you can make a silent movie all you have to be is very clever in 60 seconds
9000917 the filmmakers should concentrate on the more human aspects of this story how people can use their savings how they can better manage their household budgets what it means to them to lower their own price of gas
9000918 making a how to manual for the program would be fine but we want local artists to tap into the most emotional aspects of the story if they can
9000919 this is a great way to challenge the creativity of the filmmaking community
9000920 were always privileged to look at the amazing work coming out of the new england filmmaking community and this contest provides all our local filmmakers with yet another avenue to channel their energy and ideas

9000922 too often agriculture is seen as an unproductive and unprofitable sector
9000923 gt ifad said at the african green revolution conference underway in oslo norway
9000924 but the truth is that agriculture and those tilling the land men and women smallholder farmers have the capacity to feed the world while managing and protecting some of the key assets of our global environment
9000925 the world urgently needs a green revolution in africa and the african continent has the potential to deliver
9000926 but we are still failing collectively to give africa the level of coordinated and cohesive support that it needs to do so

9000934 im not a sex addict i have never been to those meetings its hurtful to my family and if i was involved with a woman in a monogamous relationship it would be hurtful to her there was another story claiming i was a neat freak if i had to choose one of the two i think id rather be a sex addict

9000941 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9000942 the advocacy center is still involved in this case and finds the suicide idea ridiculous if mr diries intention was to commit suicide he could have done so in canada

9000948 i am certainly willing to do that they are the ones that elected me
9000949 if other municipalities would like to approach their voters separately they have that prerogative
9000950 ive never seen members of our community stressed so much about their personal financial situations as they are right now
9000951 the timing is terrible raising taxes in a recession is never a good idea
9000952 i would dearly love to be able to tell you what to cut i dont know what to tell you
9000953 if to talk to oneself when alone is folly it must be doubly unwise to listen to oneself in the presence of others
9000954 are american women shallow and superficial enough to let the presence image of a woman placate their egos enough to vote republican even though it is clearly against their own best interests

9000962 i think barack obama threw a lot of love at women last night and at women over 40 in particular
9000963 a lot of his issues were molded from watching the difficulty the women who raised him go through his mother having to fight the insurers on her sick bed his grandmother having to work several jobs so he could go to school and then to big cheers he mentioned paying teachers more and equal pay for equal work women still earn 77 cents to a mans dollar
9000964 he gave womens issues utmost importance last night and i think women over 40 will respond
9000965 women who voted for hillary didnt just vote for hillary because she has a uterus they voted for her because of where she stood on many issues that are important to women i think sarah palin is a very brave daring idea for the republicans but i dont necessarily think it will bring in the hillary votes
9000966 i wish i could say that i knew something about her but i just dont

9000978 in our own xcritic forums the demand for fiery redheads has been made clear fans of redheads will have a lot of freckles and red hair to appreciate jacks redhead adventure might be the start of a great new series
9000979 the middle class of this country has never been as unsure of their future and we have never been as isolated barack obama has been very explicit about how hes going to level the playing field for the firemen and the cops and the linemen and the salespersons and the nurses to improve their circumstance so their next generation is better off than they were

9001021 cut through all the red tape and stuff i think girardis done a tremendous job giving what has occurred
9001022 he continues to try to remain upbeat with this coaching staff to try to keep these players up and to try to perform up to their abilities

9001029 its been a cumulative effect but what weve got to do myself and my brother hal is get this thing back on track like they did in the 90s
9001030 there is enough blame to go around certainly its not joe girardi thats for sure steinbrenner said

9001084 salvation is not a detached gift of god in some gracious and miraculous way bestowed upon man salvation is christ and to experience salvation is to experience christ it is not the experience of something but of someone the bible does not teach that christ has salvation and dispenses it like a benevolent master giving gifts to his servants who obey him christ is our salvation and gives himself to us as our salvation he is our life he is our strength he is our peace he is our joy he is our wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption

9001093 the key achievement of the navy chiefs visit to japan and south korea is that the two countries have agreed to hold separate staff level talks with the indian navy to discuss the nitty gritty of widening the scope of exercise and bilateral defence cooperation
9001094 in fact south korea proposed to hold a staff level talk with the indian navy the indian navy stands to gain in terms of ship building from both the countries leading ship building country south korea delivers a ship every two and a half days which in itself is an amazing record
9001095 we talked about getting their design technology and also to collaborate in development of ships
9001096 during his visits to the naval academies admiral mehta also discussed training exchange programmes

9001112 one of the principle benefits to consumers of a two way plug and play solution is precisely that it will facilitate interactive services without the need for a set top box
9001113 so a two way solution that permits interactivity only in conjunction with a providers unique set top box particularly when the traditional cable incumbents would not need a set top box for the same level of functionality is no solution at all

9001141 it will also help client and client agencies select the right partner for particular digital production jobs
9001142 ms estrin traces silicon valleys troubles to the tech boom when entrepreneurs and venture capitalists started focusing more on starting companies to turn around and sell them and less on building successful companies for the long term starting in 1998 there was such a shift in silicon valley toward chasing money and short term returns she said
9001143 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
9001144 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
9001145 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
9001146 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
9001147 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
9001148 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
9001149 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
9001150 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
9001151 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
9001152 obese patients with asthma are more difficult to treat because their response to bronchoconstriction is exaggerated and gives the impression that the asthma is worse
9001153 they may well have worse symptoms but not as a result of underlying airway inflammation still the typical response is often to increase their inhaled anti inflammatory therapy this is unlikely to provide the answer and may even do harm the answer lies in dealing with the obesity itself

9001160 the large and growing unmet need for pediatric hiv aids services demonstrates that failure of our pmtct programs to avert parent to child transmission of hiv
9001161 if we prevent hiv infection in children then we do not need to take care of them when they are infected
9001162 cultural beliefs social stigma ignorance and economic status influenced the mothers attitudes and preference for the different feeding alternatives
9001163 deny their spouses the opportunity to participate in the program
9001164 we have a moral obligation to ensure that our children and grandchildren are born and remain free from hiv aids

9001168 bad news is that nearly three million of them got their coverage through government programs
9001169 the slide toward a government dominated taxpayer supported health sector will continue
9001170 states could help by lightening their regulatory burdens to encourage greater competition for more attractive and affordable coverage
9001171 more regulation and less competition generally means less affordable coverage
9001172 f reeing americans to buy health insurance across state lines would give people more choices in health care
9001173 needs to do its part by updating todays policies to better fit a mobile 21st century economy
9001174 help millions of people buy coverage who cant afford it now
9001175 help people keep their health insurance when they lose their jobs or move
9001176 the complex problems in our health sector are best cured by a bigger dose of market competition not more government intervention
9001177 i know it will demand the best i have to give and i promise nothing less

9001179 gov palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington

9001182 actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9001183 it shows perhaps that hes a bit of a gambler that he was willing at this stage to roll the dice
9001184 its a tremendous risk to take someone of this little experience
9001185 shows that theyre making a concerted effort to go after women voters who are upset that barack obama passed over hillary clinton

9001214 the excitement was palpable among conservative leaders when they heard that gov palin was sen mccains choice for vice president there is a high level of optimism among conservative leaders that the mccain palin combination is a ticket that will connect with values voters
9001215 the selection of gov palin means that this upcoming election will be historic but beyond making history palin brings substance and excitement she is intelligent young attractive and articulate as a woman and a mother she can attract women voters particularly those who feel disenfranchised
9001216 gov palin can work with both parties and has shown she can clean up government corruption she has not merely talked about the energy crisis she has actively worked to create solutions
9001217 gov palin is pro life and pro marriage she is also a lifelong member of the national rifle association
9001218 personnel is policy with the selection of gov palin sen john mccain has proven that he can exercise sound judgment gov palin has electrified conservatives

9001221 if it comes to a mass sprint the team will work for elia rigotto he showed in the eneco tour that he is in very good form since the top sprinters are all in the vuelta or the d tour we figure we have a chance for some good results
9001222 day one of nationals started out with the mens individual pursuits and all the team pursuits
9001223 but to win we have to race aggressively we cant wait until the end
9001224 some guys will be in the early break someone will be helping our key guys keeping them in the right place and bringing them to the front before the big climb
9001225 obviously this is a new great experience for joe and phil to be part of the pro team at nationals
9001226 joe needs to be active in the early part of the race and if any break goes he will need to be there for phil this is his first race with the team after his surgery so he will be helping the guys from the beginning until the end
9001227 the important thing is to see where he stands now
9001228 this will be very helpful for his preparation for the 2009 season
9001229 im very happy with the route this year itll be a great vuelta there are some tough mountain stages and a few tough ones in between as well so it should be interesting i think the stages in asturia might be quite decisive we have a very competent group of guys here even though theres only one rider from the tour line up all nine of us are top motivated and thats what counts i might automatically be among the favorites because i won the tour but some of the other guys and teams will also have to step up and claim responsibility in this race especially alberto contador whos been preparing himself specifically for the vuelta im confident that we as a team will be able to put our mark on this race
9001230 as usual we have a broad team with a lot of different strengths both karsten kroon and alexandr kolobnev are able to neutralize breaks in all kinds of terrain and for the sprints in the first week we have haedo and matti then we have volodymir gustov inigo cuesta and michael blaudzun whos jobs are to assist carlos as much as possible and if jurgen is as strong in the mountains as last year he should be able to do well
9001231 theres no doubt that our main goal is the podium in madrid but we also have some great opportunities along the way
9001232 of course itll be quite a strange experience for me ill be nostalgic at times im sure but im at peace with my decision and ive had time to get used to the idea since i made it during last winter but im looking forward to this race and i hope to be able to do well in both the first time trial and as helper for carlos along the way

9001325 for every dollar that has been invested so far at least three more of the federal dollars approved to shield the city from massive storms remain unspent
9001326 senior republicans said images of political celebration in the twin cities while thousands of americans flee a hurricane could be disastrous

9001353 i hope this campaign will convince young people how important it is for them to wear their seatbelts
9001354 seatbelts save lives and our goal is to have 100 percent of our citizens using seatbelts

9001356 we found that 80 percent of our young people killed in crashes over the past five years were not wearing seatbelts we have to find some way to change this

9001398 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9001399 we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few
9001400 oils gone up too much because people were buying it for all the wrong reasons like not wanting to hold on to the dollar or worrying about putting money in the bank
9001401 barring a major disaster we expect oil prices could go below 100 maybe by the end of this year or even faster as its obvious that the trend for demand is falling off pretty dramatically
9001402 current weather forecasts are predicting that hurricane gustav willmake landfall as a major storm somewhere along the central gulf coast areaearly next week and may directly impact sabines system and operations

9001417 i think she is an excellent choice as an effective reform governor she brings important executive experience to the ticket a strong fiscal conservative she stood up against wasteful pork barrel politics when she killed alaskas infamous bridge to nowhere that was promoted by senator ted stevens and supported by senator frank lautenberg
9001418 senator mccain made a brilliant decision by asking her to join the gop ticket i am very excited to be running with both of them in new jersey
9001419 governor palin is a fiscal and proven reformer who has fought against wasteful spending and pork barrel politics
9001420 oh i know there will be quite a scrum if

9001424 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
9001425 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9001426 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9001427 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
9001428 we did have lots of contacts with georgia over a long period of time
9001429 georgia found it too hard to hold that line when they were seeing what russia was preparing to do

9001439 dont be surprised at how well the sisters painting does there has been an enormous amount of interest
9001440 i was surprised by the strength of the internet bidding several areas would have fallen flat if not for the internet comments from our internet bidders indicate that many are bidding with us because we handle the shipping of all of the smalls in house
9001441 we are seeing this translate over to our internet sales

9001446 the developer had a vision to work with us for the benefit of the community they used their money for initial grading seeding and landscaping of the lake and the park they also agreed to accept the cost of maintaining it
9001447 it was exactly the kind of project they were looking for
9001448 senator mccain made an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9001449 on february 11th of this year for example she signed into law the safe haven for infants act facilitating the safe surrender of an unwanted newborn to a place of safety and hope her actions contrasts sharply with the democratic nominee senator barack obama d ill who when he was in the illinois senate repeatedly helped to kill a bill that sought to protect babies who survived abortion
9001450 governor palin also believes that marriage is between one man and one woman in a speech in 2006 she expressed her disappointment in an alaskan supreme court ruling ordering that the state provide benefits to same sex partners i disagree with the recent court decision because i feel as though alaskans spoke on this issue with its overwhelming support for a constitutional amendment in 1998 which defined marriage as between a man and woman

9001455 the extreme rise in gas prices during the bush administration
9001456 tim mahoney and his democrat colleagues have had the chance to lower gas prices for everyone not just 50 people mahoney has blindly followed nancy pelosi and voted for do nothing bills and opposed drilling instead of passing a comprehensive energy plan
9001457 i am thrilled to be able to bring this exciting venture into south beach filling a much needed gap in alternative programming for the latino gay community
9001458 through my six years of working with the mglff i have noticed a huge demand for latin gay films and programming that was not always available the few latin films were always the first to sell out which proved a definite demand by the community
9001459 i simply could not imagine working at that festival without my longtime family who worked so hard to year after year to develop a world class event
9001460 america may not know much about sarah palin but based on what our community has seen of her we know enough
9001461 sarah palin not only supported the 1998 alaska constitutional amendment banning marriage equality but in her less than two years as governor even expressed the extreme position of supporting stripping away domestic partner benefits for state workers when you cant even support giving our community the rights to health insurance and pension benefits its a frightening window into where she stands on equality
9001462 this is the most complicated parachute test nasa has run since the 60s
9001463 the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
9001464 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
9001465 as of august 28 2008 i am officially voting for barack obama
9001466 after i got past all the rumors about him i was finally able to really look into the man he really is
9001467 for the first time i actually felt like there was some hope at the end of the tunnel
9001468 i was tired of just taking what the republican party kept saying at face value
9001469 it was very emotional i never thought i would feel this way after hearing him speak
9001470 i have at long last decided to support this man for president
9001471 fresh ideas his ability to unite the parties and his charisma
9001472 ironically what i found most impressive was the loftiness of his speech
9001473 it really sealed the deal that we do need to have change right now and that he is the better person than john mccain
9001474 i would liken the 10 year term to what john kennedy said when he wanted to put a man on the moon
9001475 i didnt think obama could top hillary or bill or even himself for that matter
9001476 never in my life have i been more on a mission to get someone elected to the presidency
9001477 this speech is going to be something that my future children study in school and ask me what it was like to be alive when barack obama was president
9001478 a maverick has picked another maverick a reformer has picked another reformer
9001479 youll get a reluctant glimpse into that dark place in my psyche that just cant get enough of peugeots
9001480 if i truly like all of the crap ive been foisting upon you is there
9001481 if this were a 1973 monte carlo which its not instead of the 1992 volvo wagon that we have i would right now be looking at a dashboard rendered entirely in matte black

9001483 hes going to say that he works for amazon com where this very bread maker is sold
9001484 dit soort dreigementen zal niet helpen om een gunstig klimaat te cre ren voor het communautair akkoord waarvoor ik dacht dat de vlamingen vragende partij waren
9001485 als ik hun houding goed begrijp geven ze wat ze willen realiseren op op het moment dat de franstaligen zich constructief opstellen om een discussie te starten rollen ze met de spierballen dat is spijtig het is niet het soort houding die zal helpen om een oplossing te vinden waar vlaanderen vragende partij voor is

9001496 first theyve got to cover the 47 million americans who dont have insurance
9001497 and then i think they need to overhaul the whole system
9001498 obamas plan is going to be covering everyone it will be fair to the people who dont have insurance healthcare should not be a privilege it should be a right
9001499 people think these are the doctors who are making so much money

9001503 well your honor they may be the eventual candidate the problem is were dealing with a large group of art so obviously we dont want to be in a position of potentially swamping a market with sales of a tremendous amount because that will tend to depress value
9001504 the best chance to realize maximum value in this case is not necessarily through a public auction
9001505 through private sales we may realize the highest value for something like this
9001506 the tharpe collection did well with the exception of the high ticket swords
9001507 the collection is strong in identified material especially items from the army of the potomac and hence we are looking at possible venues in the northeast to hold the sale

9001517 de goden inmiddels zijn aardig geschrokken hoe alles uit de hand gelopen is zij roepen beide partijen terug maar tijdens een banket probeert seth horus te vernederen en buiten spel te zetten door hem te verkrachten horus is hem echter te slim af hij slaagt erin het zaad van seth in zijn handen op te vangen voordat het zijn lichaam kan binnendringen hij vlucht naar zijn moeder die zijn hand afsnijdt om zo het zaad van seth in de moerassen kwijt te kunnen raken natuurlijk heelt zij met haar spreuken de verwonding horus tracht nu wraak te nemen op seth hij brengt zijn eigen zaad aan op een krop sla de groente die seth zo graag lust seth eet de sla en zo dringt het zaad van horus ongemerkt zijn lichaam binnen terug in de rechtszaal wordt het zaad van beide goden gevraagd getuigenis af te leggen in plaats van seths zaad in horus antwoordt het zaad van horus in de vorm van een gouden zonneschijf uit de top van seths hoofd het zaad van horus was immers van goddelijke oorsprong horus heeft weer gewonnen

9001519 enset is the last food asset for most families in this region
9001520 seeing it in the market in such quantities means there is no other food to eat
9001521 i expect to harvest food that can last me at least six months
9001522 once the food gets finished i will sell firewood or work for someone to feed the children
9001523 the big question is whether we have enough in our own economy to be able to finance it
9001524 when you get people living on the edge a shock like drought easily pushes them over
9001525 then it brings them into the cycle of not being able to pull themselves out of it
9001526 over the past two months the situation has worsened and living conditions have deteriorated people have exhausted all their resources and are unable to feed themselves
9001527 we have pockets of severe malnutrition in some districts in the south and an emergency situation in the somali region
9001528 its not small to those who are suffering but it is a manageable problem
9001529 famine has wreaked havoc in ethiopia for so long it would be stupid not to be sensitive to the risk of such things occurring but there has not been a famine on our watch emergencies but no famines
9001530 we are seeing phase one we are yet to see phase two
9001531 it is normal to have small areas of malnutrition during the hunger season when people wait for the harvest
9001532 this year it is more widespread mainly because of failed rains
9001533 comparison between the sources of food in a normal year and the past four weeks indicated a dramatic shift from own production to purchased food and other sources
9001534 the government delayed then under described the problem still it does not compare with 1984
9001535 the main problems are inadequate rains and too many people
9001536 the population has doubled in the last 22 years from 41 to almost 80 million peoples coping mechanisms have been eroded and many have got used to handouts over the years
9001537 the american kennel club akc announced today that the public has elected a poodle as their breed of choice for the obama family

9001548 is a risk factor for long term leakage but not necessarily enough to require surgery
9001549 does not seem to give good long term results and this is probably due to poor compliance
9001550 we are concerned that a lot of the evidence for both before delivery and after delivery pelvic floor muscle training suggests poor long term effect
9001551 we believe that compliance is the major issue and this can only be improved by education
9001552 what how am i going to be able to make coffee auuuugh
9001553 make it as aggressive as you can but keep it real i want it to roll onto an edge super smooth and faster than anything else out there i want it to take off like a rocket and explode off the wake but not buck me weird oh yeah of course i want it to land super soft is that too much to ask
9001554 our pro level decks for 2007 had x flex technology which added stiffness to the tip and tail the feedback on the new flex patterns was huge so for 2008 we took that technology and added ridges to the top of trevors new shape to make that tip and tail snap even more
9001555 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
9001556 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
9001557 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
9001558 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
9001559 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
9001560 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
9001561 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
9001562 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
9001563 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways

9001612 i will say this though due to the fact that real time strategy games are real time there is always an advantage to being a faster player and i think people should take that into consideration what im saying is if you like slow strategy games you might want to play turn based games instead since that removes the real time factor and then it wont matter who the faster player is and it will be more dependent on either luck or the strategy you picked
9001613 real time strategy means you have to play move think etc while the other player is too if you want time to think in an rts either think quicker or play turn based games lol

9001642 instead real consumer spending advanced at a decent 2 5 per cent pace in the spring quarter and both total wages and nominal after tax incomes were climbing at a 4 5 per cent annualized pace enough to cover the high gasoline bills without taking the savings rate below last years average

9001740 i cant fail to notice senator mccain is a fan of the attractive women many years his junior

9001770 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9001771 our money is lost islam is dignified and its supporters are numerous it is better to stay at home and invest our money
9001772 give generously for the cause of allah and do not with your own hands cast yourselves into destruction
9001773 do not kill yourselves allah is merciful to you but he that does that through wickedness and injustice shall be burnt in fire that is easy enough for allah
9001774 the one who throws himself from a mountain and kills himself will be eternally in hell
9001775 in the past there was a wounded man who impatiently cut his hand bleeding to death allah said my slave took the first step to death he is forbidden to enter paradise
9001776 we mounted an attacked on a part of hunain one of us followed an unbeliever to kill him by a mistake killed himself
9001777 and some people would give away their lives to gain allahs contentment allah is compassionate to his servants
9001778 you know that i am the best archer among you by allah you cannot reach me till i throw all my arrows and then hit with my sword as much as i could and then you can do whatever you wish
9001779 we shall not allow you to go away as a rich you came to our tribe a pauper tell us where you put your money and we let you go
9001780 o abu yahya the trade goods the highest profit then recited the verse
9001781 they sold their lives to allah by fighting for him to death
9001782 therefore fight for the cause of allah you are accountable for none but yourself
9001783 a man fights a thousand of enemies then he is killed
9001784 no let him fight to death allah says to his prophet s a w therefore fight for the cause of allah you are accountable for none but yourself
9001785 o behold my slave he went back to fight to death hoping to get what i have paradise and fearing what i have hell
9001786 the one who can fight them will be rewarded with paradise or will be my friend in paradise
9001787 our companions were not just with us meaning that they have got paradise and left them alive
9001788 the prophet s a w said the doors of heaven are opened through jihad a poor man asked you heard the prophet s a w saying that abu huraira said yes the man went to his companions said peace be upon you broke the sheath of his sword and fought to death
9001789 mohammed bin al hasan al shaibani said if a muslim fought a thousand of the unbelievers with the intention to gain allahs contentment hurting the enemy or encouraging the other muslims it is right and he will be rewarded allah willing otherwise it will be islamically void useless and pointless
9001790 it is islamic for a muslim to fight many of the unbeliever alone if he does this for the cause of allah
9001791 we can say that it is islamic for a muslim to fight many unbelievers alone with two conditions b he is sure that he will hurt them if not there is unpreferability karahiya
9001792 muslim narrated in his sahih the story of al ukhdud the furrow which the prophet s
9001793 a young muslim contributed himself for the cause of allah
9001794 it is islamically right to fight the many unbelievers alone seeking martyrdom and there is no unpreferability about that according to the majority of muslim scholars
9001795 it is islamically right if there are islamic and good objective behind his doing such as frightening and hurting the enemy encouraging the muslims

9001803 no basis in law to apply the more stringent provisions of n j r e 505 to the records of a physician even one engaged in psychotherapy given the rules specific application to licensed psychologists
9001804 in this case the documents at issue are highly personal and confidential
9001805 although they are not actually privileged solely because of the nature of the therapists license the courts and the legislature have recognized the highly sensitive nature of the documents those factors must be weighed against quinns need for the documents
9001806 that in our view bespeaks an abuse of discretion warranting our interference
9001807 these are not the type of documents for which the task of separating the relevant sections from the irrelevant should be left to opposing counsel or parties
9001808 the motion judge should also consider whether the initial disclosure should be limited to counsel and experts only unless there is a genuine need for broader disclosure such as susans relatives who are adverse parties in this action
9001809 this was frustrating because i was sure i was right
9001810 for me getting gloria and eugene on the ballot was a great chance to talk to people in my community in the bronx about the need to fight back
9001811 my first day petitioning it seemed i would never get a signature
9001812 but it was enriching to have so many conversations with people that may never have had a conversation about such taboo topics like socialism
9001813 people over profits end the war now we need socialism

9001815 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich we have the most powerful military on earth but thats not what makes us strong our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores
9001816 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9001817 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9001818 if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
9001819 dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
9001820 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9001821 history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
9001822 rules and procedures that are transparent and rules of evidence that make sense and are fair these basic principles apply universally and without them the rule of law means little or nothing
9001823 it is quite obvious from casual observation that someone who has been known to have misled others including the countrys parliament has lost the moral authority to preach about the rule of law and good governance one wonders then what basic principles blair had in mind when he gave an almost unconditional support for the unilateral decision to invade iraq against the wishes of the international community and without the approval of the un indeed as late as april 2006 when an eminent british former law lord attacked guantanamo bay as a stain on american justice blair reportedly refused to follow suit
9001824 it is disgusting to see this criminal of the highest order being welcomed in malaysia and worse still to talk on the rule of law when he broke all international laws and the laws of his own country by deliberately lying and sending young british soldiers to die in a war of aggression
9001825 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
9001826 by supporting and participating in the 2003 united states led invasion and occupation of iraq i wonder whether britain being the worlds oldest democracy still possesses moral authority in a comity of nations to lecture on the principle of rule of law

9001830 on the 45th anniversary of martin luther king jrs i have a dream speech barack obama answered back tonight with a simple i have a plan
9001831 point by point refutation of the claim that the man is all empty talk
9001832 everyone knew that barack obama can give a good speech and he did just that tonight the obama we heard from was an attractive figure too bad he doesnt exist
9001833 there was no escaping the emotional power of watching obama a black man with a name that does not flow easily from the american tongue step forward to stand center stage of history tears were not an uncommon sight during the speech
9001834 a forceful challenge to john mccain and the republicans and a restatement of the message to change washington and the nation that propelled him to the nomination
9001835 the speech itself lacked lift but had heft it wasnt precisely long on hope but i think it showed audacity
9001836 obama proved tonight again that hes one of the few most gifted public communicators of the last generation
9001837 but this time he proved it by not excelling in soaring rhetoric or delivering a speech that will be remembered for the ages rather he recognised that tonights speech didnt have to be an effort to join the rhetorical hall of fame
9001838 for a person of his character to embark on this course of action i think he is at the end of his tether
9001839 started to understand some of the issues that face our communities around hate discrimination stereotyping and stigmatisation
9001840 we regret that we missed the opportunity to tell matthew mitchams story we apologize for this unintentional omission
9001841 they failed to mention that the problem was dealing with anxiety and depression associated with coming out of the closet
9001842 however the higher ups at nbc sports decided that all these bits of information were not ready for prime time
9001843 the omission shows a sore lack of sound news judgment
9001844 you could argue that his sexual orientation has nothing to do with the competition but then again neither does what michael phelps eats for breakfast that divers david boudia and thomas finchum are roommates or that the decathlon prepared bryan clay for being a father all of which were mentioned more than once
9001845 i just want to be known as the australian diver who did really well at the olympics
9001846 these days perhaps because i do care so much about the medium that has sustained me in so many ways for so long i find it difficult to stand the disappointment of a bad movie which is to say the vast majority of movies my feeling is that life is too short and i never used to feel that way but life wasnt quite as short then either i still maintain you can learn as much from an utterly misconceived failed or incompetent movie or war or political administration as you can from a great one although that doesnt make the former any easier to withstand while youre living through it
9001847 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
9001848 i may disagree with what you say but im so god damned tired of hearing it that fuck yeah
9001849 efforts by certain parties to destabilise the country by attempting to seize power through illegitimate means and without the mandate of the people must be rejected
9001850 we cannot allow uncertainties to continue as this will adversely affect foreign investment economic sentiment and the capital markets
9001851 i will not permit the mandate given by the people to be seized from bn which won the last election with a majority of the seats based on democratic principles
9001852 this is a home run she is a reformer governor who is solidly pro life and a person of deep christian faith and she is really one of the bright shining new stars in the republican firmament

9001868 only a radical jolt to the psyche will cause someone to explicitly break away from their peer group
9001869 in my experience i am slowly coming to the conclusion that in many of these cases the radical jolt began with some form of sexual molestation in which the childs inner dignity was violated when someone is hurt on that level it defiles the innermost intimate dimensions of the psyche it drives the child into silence out of shame and fear he will not speak about the abuse with parents or teachers a silence andloneliness that eats away like a cancer at the childs inner dignity

9001877 one of the things we do when we give out the samples is we tell people about how we get the different varieties of honey and its also just very difficult to describe the flavour of something like honey the best way is to let people taste it for themselves
9001878 our main goal here is to minimize any risk of illness we do realize that there have been a number of different outbreaks associated with this form of setting
9001879 he said we werent allowed to serve food so we decided to describe our honey as an antibacterial mouthwash he didnt seem too amused
9001880 i suspect as you consolidate outpatient services as you consolidate community based services as you consolidate addiction services then the need for admissions to hospitals gets reduced that can change the figures

9001882 weve contacted dietitians that have long standing experience in our homes and theyve never been warned about listeriosis or deli meats being a huge issue or that they should be avoided
9001883 the canadian government needs to be a little more aggressive in informing canadians of the risks associated with refrigerated ready to eat foods like deli meats
9001884 the provinces and territories require staff in these institutions to have a standard level of knowledge about food borne illnesses such as listeria

9001887 in poor african countries like lesotho hiv infected children are offered exemplary treatment while children suffering from much simpler to treat diseases are left untreated sometimes to die notes an aids researcher quoted in a post at reason entitled and when they do try to prevent the spread of aids they do it the most expensive and ineffective ways possible like using expensive anti retroviral drugs and importing condoms that have little chance of consistently reaching remote villages
9001888 hold on there bucko per capita ranking is all very well but the fact is that there are a billion chinese and a billion indians china actually emits more in total than us third and fourth on the list are indonesia and india the developing world is where the emissions are increasingly coming from why because it helps make them rich america putting on a hair shirt is going to do nothing to stop that process now there is something called the environmental kuznets curve which suggests that the environment becomes more important in political decision making as societies become richer but that doesnt appear to be affected by example the best we can do is not to hope that the developing world will stop going up the curve but that we can help them over the top and down the other side faster

9001901 the bloody cycle in which i live made up of assassinations terrorist attacks bombings and shootings has resulted in an increasing number of victims on both sides it is a vicious circle that is sustained by the choice of both sides to engage in violence i refuse to take part in this choice
9001902 and my conscience will simply not allow me take part in the oppression of another people
9001903 obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign

9001905 you always want to be in that position you dont want to see a player leave but you want the positions to be competitive
9001906 were never interested in stat quo and were not in this situation either

9001908 i certainly did like the production and the way he took the ball and went north with it i liked that part of it with darcy there were a couple of really good plays and he put himself in position to make a couple of good blocks
9001909 he made some nice catches obviously theres a lot of work to be done just in terms of catching up with the little things but i thought he demonstrated the ability to really catch the ball in a lot of circumstances and conditions it was a good start for him

9001936 today senator mccain made an exciting decision in choosing alaska governor sarah palin to join him on his ticket as the vice presidential candidate governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government governor palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9001937 for the first time since the crimean war russia has no allies
9001938 we are encircled by countries that are either suspicious or alienated and very angry
9001939 unless they are russia dedicated they will move to friendlier environments sentiment is just very bad
9001940 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
9001941 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia
9001942 if there is a perception of russia as a risky place or as an undesirable place to invest then the damage will be more long term
9001943 it will restrict the development of the economy and hurt the governments plans to create a more diversified the economy
9001944 it is big aggressive undemocratic and irresponsible georgia who took small and innocent south ossetia
9001945 are sad about the situation and i have had many e mails from people asking why the media is reporting the situation only from one side
9001946 this is a strategic and long term mistake the effects of which will be felt by virtually all russians
9001947 democratic values and cooperation with the west will be seen as a betrayal
9001948 but its going to turn up a couple of notches its not a trend reversal
9001949 my family and i eat a healthy diet heavy in wild alaskan seafood moose caribou and fresh fruit
9001950 i was going crazy i was jittery i twitched i trembled i had no patience for anything every single nerve ending was demanding a drink and a cigarette
9001951 i couldnt believe id said it i didnt know why id said it id never said it before
9001952 shimmering dazzling nearly blinding brightness that made me cover my eyes with my hands
9001953 they now know that they were used as decoys well after mccain had decided not to pick them
9001954 i know hillary clinton and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9001955 both campaigns seemed to have decided that hillary clintons 18 millions voters represent a key swing bloc in this election both barack obamas speech and john mccains pick were at least partially aimed at them
9001956 it is a slap in womens face to think that all we deserve is second place

9001966 i want to see how close to 60 votes we can get in the senate what the committee structure is and how best i can use my time
9001967 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference
9001968 the question is how can i best do that is it using the seniority i have in the senate or is it in getting out there and running for governor
9001969 i have run statewide four times now i have a base its up and down the state
9001970 the state is so big i think candidates misjudge california they think they can get in a bus and go around and see enough people you cant you need to be known you need to raise the money you need to have a combination of campaign organization support and programs
9001971 this isnt 2010 i dont need to build an organization to run i dont need to do an exploratory committee to run that is all out there if i want to do it therefore at the appropriate time i will make a decision
9001972 thats not as many as arlo guthrie who wrote about 7 500 but then hes older than us
9001973 they took their hats off when they shook my hand and i thought wow you dont see that much up here
9001974 a lot of our music is educational we like to educate people about the old and new west
9001975 weve got no songs about wild trucks and wild women

9001977 trust me your concerns about sachs and judah doing 90210 are the same concerns everyone has had including jeff and i
9001978 we were the first ones to go can we pull this off
9001979 he still asks us to give notes on rough cuts and at table reads and on scripts that family will never be apart
9001980 our writing is not gonna change this is who we write this is how we create stories
9001981 were both fathers we like this central family that moves into beverly hills and its a question of how do they hold onto their moral center
9001982 we think this generation of parenting is different than the ones we grew up with we as parents did almost everything that our kids are doing our parents didnt do that its a lot harder to lie to us we know what theyre doing and they cant get away with stuff that they think they are because we did it 20 years ago
9001983 the network and the studio theyre very concerned about every little part of this
9001984 its such a big business now were not in a world where they go hey creative guys heres a bunch of money go shoot something theres so much relying on the success of this show
9001985 what we expected was teaching letters and numbers and colors and shapes
9001986 it has never been more critical for our children to master socialization skills
9001987 from childrens play groups to collaboration in the classroom kids today engage in significantly more structured group activities raising the profile and the necessity for good social skills
9001988 moms see that as their number one job as a parent
9001989 theres not a lot of opportunity to model what good behavior is
9001990 the frustration is that a lot of times theyre the bad guy
9001991 todays parents do not want to spend their time fighting with their kids
9001992 i originally aimed these at lonely youngsters but they seems to be popular with people of all ages
9001993 sarah palin is better without a teleprompter than obama with one
9001994 congratulations governor palin we look forward to a spirited race
9001995 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9001996 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9001997 for someone who has never spoken before a national audience in the most challenging moment of her life sarah palin is displaying a kind of comfort that is well obama like
9001998 you are going to have a lot of women voters wondering why senator obama didnt tap senator clinton as his running mate

9002014 anyone whos concerned about the possibility of targeted violence should come
9002015 part of the horror of targeted violence is that it occurs in places where youre not expecting it where its not supposed to happen
9002016 while theres probably no one right way to respond to it in the event something happens in the community we need to be able to effectively and compassionately deal with it in the short term the mid term and the long term
9002017 she knows the area she knows all the players shes dealt with crisis intervention for 25 years and knows how things work here and because of the shootings shes had experience that none of us have had

9002022 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
9002023 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
9002024 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9002025 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9002026 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9002027 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9002028 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9002029 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9002030 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
9002031 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia
9002032 the reasonable action to be undertaken was the cut off of diplomatic relations as a temporary measure after the end of the occupation of the territory we will see when and how that can be restored
9002033 we regret this step from the georgian side it will not assist our bilateral relations
9002034 orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation
9002035 russian armed forces including so called peacekeepers are declared as occupying armed forces

9002062 the killing of swamiji was most unfortunate incident and unwarranted he was a true social reformer we all missed guruji of chakapa for a longtime his security concerns downplayed
9002063 christians have killed swamiji we would give a befitting reply to it very soon
9002064 we would forced to opt violent protest if action not taken against the killers
9002065 we have called a 12 hour shut down on monday protesting against the killing
9002066 never have fears of death when you are working for the cause of the motherland
9002067 the killing of swamiji was most unfortunate incident and unwarranted he was a true social reformer we all missed guruji of chakapa for a longtime his security concerns downplayed
9002068 christians have killed swamiji we would give a befitting reply to it very soon
9002069 we would forced to opt violent protest if action not taken against the killers
9002070 we have called a 12 hour shut down on monday protesting against the killing
9002071 christian militants have killed swamiji not maoists police as well as the orissa government trying to cover up the matter and sheltering the church sponsored militants
9002072 we have also demanded to set up a commission to look into the activities of churches missionaries church sponsored ngos foreign funding to ngos working for conversion and strict implementation of anti conversion laws
9002073 it seems orissa government is patronizing conversion activities and it is also under pressure from the churches
9002074 we cant keep silent sadhus and santhas from across the country would march towards orissa chief ministers office in bhubaneswar
9002075 from nepal to kashmir to kandhamal they only want to eliminate hindus in a country like india majority feeling persecuted under the upas rule at centre
9002076 whilst freedom of religion is a basic human right proselytism receives universal condemnation proselytism is defined as the use of unscrupulous methods of persuasion such as material inducements psychological pressure or spiritual threats to compel a person to change his or her religion proselytism attacks other religious beliefs and practices and proclaims that its own religion is the only way to salvation it is often supported by financial resources and marketing techniques that make local religious activities seem second rate and inferior
9002077 it turns out that staines and his wife gladys regularly filed despatches for a journal in australia tidings
9002078 besides his involvement with the leprosy house staines was also involved in missionary work the missionary work of staines has come to light from the various desptches sent by him to australia which are published in the newsletter tidings staines also used to take part in baptism ceremonies however it is the despatchs sent by staines to australia in the newsletter tidings that make it clear that staines was also involved in active propogation of his religion apart from his social work it is also clear from the said despatches that conversions were taking place in jungle camps it is obvious therefore that staines was both a social worker engaged in the treatment and eradication of leprosy amongst the poorest of the poor and also a missionary driven by a deep commitment to his religion and the belief that he should spread its tenets amongst the people in the area his missionary activities did lead to conversions of tribals to his faith
9002079 first we thought someone is bursting crackers and so we ran towards the main gate then we saw and heard people screaming and running there was blood all over the place swamiji and mataji and others were lying in blood i shouted and ran away we all started running here and there
9002080 swamiji ran into the toilet to save himself and shut the door mataji who hid behind the door was shot first the miscreants then broke open the toilet door and sprayed bullets
9002081 i rushed towards the main gate along with others only to see some men running around and loud cracking noise i heard the cries of swamiji and others i saw other swamijis running here and there i was scared and ran inside the hostel room with another girl we sat huddled together until after a long time one of the swamijis came and escorted us out of the room
9002082 i too rushed out after hearing the noise i saw bodies lying in blood i touched swamijis feet who was lying in the bathroom it was still warm but he did not move nor did mataji who lay inside the room
9002083 we had written 30 times to the state government that swamijis and our lives were at stake that we were being threatened by christian leaders before the incident we got a letter threatening to kill swamiji we formally complained to the police and district authorities they sent only four baton wielding constables
9002084 not a single minister visited us after the incident not even of our bjp the collector comes sometimes he gave us rice dal and sugar for the children
9002085 the maoists can never do this it is christians who threaten us everyday and they did this
9002086 no one called us for any meeting or to take part in any peace process as long as are kept out the violence will continue
9002087 the state central committee of the maoists had no knowledge of this

9002119 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match governor palin has spent her time in office shaking up government in alaska and actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president

9002153 if this was in the workplace it would be discrimination and it would be unheard of but because its a school they think they can somehow get away with it
9002154 it fully gives the impression that its wrong to take a same sex partner and i dont think that it is
9002155 weve just come back from a month long tour and we are eager to play for our hometown again
9002156 weve gained some experience on the road and were more ready than ever to introduce our songs to a larger audience

9002164 i would be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states

9002166 it turns out that women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9002167 a ship in harbor is safe but that is not why a ship is built people in america expect us to seek public office and serve for the right reasons
9002168 this is a moment when principles matter a lot more than the party line and this is a man who has been there always to serve the country and not just the party and this is a moment that requires resolve and toughness and strength of heart in the american president and my husband has shown these qualities in the darkest of places and in the service of his country
9002169 im sure shes trying we havent been off the phone for a second
9002170 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources she leads a state that matters to every one of us
9002171 in alaska governor palin challenged a corrupt system and passed a landmark ethics reform bill she has actually used her veto and cut budgetary spending she put a stop to the bridge to nowhere that would have cost taxpayers 400 million dollars
9002172 a maverick with a record of reform picks a maverick with a record of reform with this pick john mccain is putting washington on notice theres a shake up coming
9002173 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9002174 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
9002175 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
9002176 i will not be in dayton ohio so i think thats a fair assumption
9002177 there are currently three federal conservative cabinet ministers shaping policy for the stephen harper government who also sat around the mike harris cabinet table when decisions were made to cut programs privatize and regulate
9002178 governments should have learned from the mistakes that led to the tragedy in walkerton i am completely shocked that mr harper has opted to make the same mistakes nationally that led to our disaster food security should never be placed on the chopping block in the name of cost cutting
9002179 we suffered a little setback and the purchase has yet to be concluded
9002180 we are just waiting for approvals from eletrobr s and power regulator aneel to close the deals
9002181 my office is currently hard at work preparing next years revenue estimates but it is safe to say that in the current economic climate were in for more bad news
9002182 whatever happens in november we will still have a significant budgetary shortfall some have estimated it to be as much as 1 billion
9002183 wont solve our fiscal problems in fact they will only make them worse
9002184 good news is that the bad news may be in the past
9002185 mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9002186 his african heritage comes from arabic slaves traders in africa the fact that he is presenting himself in this way is deceitful and wrong it will catch up with him
9002187 what the hell let me answer some of this because youre making me crazy john mccain
9002188 i have experience because i run a state or i have experience because i was head of a battalion or i ran a company
9002189 lookie here ladies look what i brought you can make womens history with me
9002190 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002191 i arrived there about 10 15pm and heard people screaming for help
9002192 i could see them trying to get out and the sound of their voices is something i will live with for the rest of my life
9002193 my husband tried to help them but i had to hold him back because the flames were too high
9002194 they were all in shock and kept asking me what happened and if i could drive as quickly as possible to the hospital because they didnt want to die
9002195 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002196 and a traditional leader who is also a politician but lacking in foresight and wisdom can do more damage then good to the vanua if he or she does not understand the different dynamics between a traditional and an introduced system of governance such as the provincial council
9002197 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002198 would be sadly missed by those who shared his knowledge
9002199 he was a seasoned councillor and contributed a lot of issues that were discussed
9002200 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002201 i dont know how i would have coped if something had happened to my son i dont think i could have dealt with that
9002202 i dont know how it happened but the baby fell inside the bus
9002203 i was sitting in the back seat and managed to kick open one of the back windows
9002204 i still think i could have done something and that image of her struggling to get out just plays over and over again in my mind
9002205 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002206 it was wonderful to see them in town meeting the community the people of labasa
9002207 they are our queens and it must take a lot of courage and goodwill to invest their time and money in helping the lives of the unfortunate
9002208 we are just local girls but they treated us like celebrities and that was humbling
9002209 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002210 i have never experienced anything as horrific as this and i do not wish this experience on anyone it was awful but somehow i managed to keep cool i dont know how to explain it but that was how it happened i can only thank god that i am alive and intact
9002211 i know everybody noticed that i still have my bags almost all the passengers lost theirs either because they used it trying to put the fire out or because of the panic that ensued
9002212 all i can say is that i am grateful and i thank the lord
9002213 i was sitting two seats behind the driver and as soon as i saw him jump i looked for the nearest window that had opened and jumped i landed in the bushes and had to weed my way through the shrubbery to get to safety somehow i wasnt worried about the fire for some strange reason i was more worried about the electric poles
9002214 then when another nephew from nadi who also attended the funeral died we all decided to travel to nadi to bid our last farewell we never expected it would end in a tragedy such as this
9002215 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002216 he has no place to stay because his relatives have been calling us and telling us they have disowned him
9002217 the police have also gathered that the level of animosity against the accused is so high that people are threatening him with grievous harm if he is released
9002218 i have nothing to say because i know what i did was wrong
9002219 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002220 the bus that met the unfortunate fate was in top condition and we are astonished as to what would have gone wrong
9002221 we express our deepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the affected families for the loss of their loved one
9002222 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002223 the bus was supposed to pick us at 2pm but when it hadnt arrived about 5pm i went to the raiwaqa bus depot to see what was the reason for the delay
9002224 none of us have grieved yet the loss of lives has yet to hit us
9002225 he brushed me off and just told the mechanics to hurry up and get the job done
9002226 we drove to korovou prison and picked the rest of the family and got on our way
9002227 things started going wrong as soon as we left suva
9002228 the bus had great difficulty climbing hills and the driver had problems changing gear from the moment we started to go
9002229 when we reached sigatoka i thought that the driver would stop the bus so that the women and children could relieve themselves this would have been an opportune time for him to check the bus because the heat inside was unbearable
9002230 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002231 this is the time to voice your opinions and be involved as we strive to build a better fiji for all
9002232 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002233 whenever we go to the institute the tutors promise us it will happen at the beginning of the month but when that time comes around they tell us end of the month it will happen
9002234 but that hasnt happened and its high time they just tell us the truth
9002235 some of us took out loans from the banks to pay for fees and we are being hounded by those we borrowed money from on the promise that once our daughters graduated we would pay back what we owe
9002236 but how can we do that when they havent been hired
9002237 we cant leave the country for employment overseas because we havent served our bonds
9002238 but we have been trying to help the graduates and the ministry of health and psc have assured us there are vacancies
9002239 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002240 this is so shocking it is hard to believe we were supposed to go back home together
9002241 we looked after one of my wifes sisters child because she and her husband teach all the way up in namosi so every school holiday we travel to nabua where another of her sisters koleta lives
9002242 i really dont know what to say as we have always been together
9002243 i took the lead to nadi as part of a group of men who were taking the magiti it never occurred that it would be our last goodbye
9002244 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002245 on friday at about 8pm an off duty police officer came to my place at sikituru with a friend of mine
9002246 they said a report had been lodged at nadi police station by my former employer who alleged i stole his watch and gold chain
9002247 i told the nadi police i knew nothing about it
9002248 but they started beating me with an iron rod made me eat a frog and forced to drink human urine which i refused and they continued to beat me
9002249 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002250 however mr teleni has not yet given authorisation to start the investigation
9002251 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002252 i have instructed lta and nrsc national road safety council to also look into safety features of public vehicles in this case buses to allow for some safety features to be in place to protect against future repetition of this kind of accident particularly when busses have fitted windows
9002253 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002254 as far as the third reading was concerned the way we wanted to place our ministers was not accepted but its not a big deal
9002255 they said we could take our submission to the standing committee
9002256 in order to increase the divisions a request has to come from the division to the conference it has to be accepted by the conference
9002257 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002258 australia and new zealand wont tolerate such a system because it is race based
9002259 at that time the flp was the only party that stressed to accept sir paul reeves recommendations
9002260 i am here to tell we cannot afford to have communal voting
9002261 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002262 we as a trade union body wish to see that unemployment and inflation are controlled because the social and economic problems have a direct impact on children
9002263 the ftu has continued to call on the interim regime to respect the rule of law and return the country to democracy without delay under the 1997 constitution
9002264 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002265 the teams have at least one and half weeks for distribution and consultation and it should be a very swift and interesting time for people in vanua levu
9002266 our objective is to cover as widely and extensively as possible and we are leaving no stone unturned
9002267 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002268 what ever happens do not ever ever be tempted to join the coup not in this life and not in the next life
9002269 i was supposed to be a role model as a journalist but i betrayed my colleagues and friends
9002270 i have been in the prison for eight years and dont know when i will get out
9002271 the project is primarily there to help people like me who have made wrong choices and ended up in prison
9002272 and when we come out we have difficulties in finding jobs difficulties in being accepted back by rejection from the society the family and simply we are ostracised
9002273 and therefore the ultimate idea is to redirect from the life of crime to one of truthful citizen
9002274 it is about giving a second chance to the offenders because there are only two alternatives left either the society help us to get employed and accepted or we go back into a life of crime
9002275 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002276 if we see that his or her conditions is deteriorating we have the power to force them to eat
9002277 leigh v gladstone and others 21 t l r 139 has decided that it is the duty of the prison officials to preserve the health of the prisoner in their custody and fortiori to preserve their lives that case was a case of forcible tube feeding of a suffragette
9002278 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002279 we have lost a staunch loyal member of the soqosoqo who was the secretary from 1999 to 2003
9002280 that was where the headquarters was built in 1967 and to many women adi mei has been synonymous with this organisation
9002281 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002282 we will question him after all the witnesses have been interviewed
9002283 no one can remember a fire that has claimed so many lives
9002284 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002285 the meeting was of the view that such an exercise could intimidate citizens in particular when the charter teams would include security forces personnel
9002286 the board is of the view that no one including the charter teams have the right to enter private homes without the home owners permission
9002287 fictu calls on its members to support the decision taken by the management board which is consistent with our earlier decision to boycott the national council for building a better fiji
9002288 we believe any real logistical difficulties to hold the election by march 2009 under the 1997 constitution would have been received well by the south pacific island leaders who are simply trying to help us restore democracy under the rules we have chosen for ourselves
9002289 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002290 we start in the second week of january and the induction will be during at the next conference in rewa
9002291 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002292 we asked the investigating team to carry out the investigation again
9002293 the second round of investigation results have not reached me yet so i assume it is still going on however mr prasad was asked to resume duty from last week and this will not affect the investigation in any way
9002294 i have to be strong and it will take time to improve standards from here
9002295 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002296 this includes australia which has the highest per capita greenhouse emission in the world and supplies 30 per cent of the worlds coal exports ms nabou said leaders were tricked into welcoming a japanese and european climate change program which pacific citizens knew nothing about
9002297 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002298 governor palins story is one that all americans will find inspiring
9002299 shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger i look forward to campaigning for senator mccain governor palin and republicans all across the country
9002300 the increased rates will be reviewed at intervals of three months by the major tender board for adjustment in response to movement in pib approved fuel prices
9002301 the fuel increase has not been reflected in the price of contract rates and that is why the contractors asked for an increase
9002302 in fact this is the first time for contractors to request a review
9002303 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002304 and i also turn 56 on saturday today which is the day i fly out to australia i want to go and live with my son and his family and i am looking forward to spending more time with my two grandchildren she said
9002305 although i joined the force 34 years ago i still feel that i am new here because of the support and attitude of those who came after me she said
9002306 concentrate on the quality of your work and not the quantity you should give your very best to whatever you do she said
9002307 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002308 when we started in 2004 i received about seven complaints
9002309 it is so sad we dont get to know about it until they are leaving
9002310 i hope the police will help us create awareness about the cases
9002311 maybe they can visit the homes and tell the families that they know they have foreign students staying with them
9002312 and in the process they lose out on the income which is about 500 which they receive every month
9002313 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002314 there was an incident when a teacher sent a student out of the classroom because the student was drawing instead of listening
9002315 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9002316 nouni ngebayangin nanti pas reunian ayah sama bunda udah punya 2 anak yang satu bayi digendong
9002317 even though im getting tired i really love what i do
9002318 has been named director of advancement at notre dame high school
9002319 it gives a lot of us guys something to shoot for and try to achieve
9002320 the last few seasons being picked dead last is always frustrating but as time has gone on things have improved now it is nice to have people pick us as one of the top couple teams in the conference i think that is a responsibility for us to hopefully live up to those expectations
9002321 typically their program is marked by having very very fast skill players
9002322 they have fast wide receivers defensive backs linebackers guys can actually run in that program and when you are playing the spread you really have to be disciplined and it is assignment related football
9002323 we are working hard to bottle that up it puts a lot of pressure on my position to make sure everybody is following their responsibilities but we are excited to get into game week
9002324 all this criticism of raikkonen reminds me of when filippo inzaghi was at juventus and everyone said he was in crisis if he didnt score for three matches
9002325 and im also a huge mma fan ive been around the sport for years
9002326 i thought about this idea to put on an event and raise the awareness of shriners hospitals and what they do
9002327 we just put the concept together and we thought what a great place to start it out here in santa monica
9002328 andre galvao who is a seven time world brazilian jiu jitsu world champion is making his mma debut
9002329 he was tough to find a fight for everyone is talking smack that theyll fight him when it came time to sign no one wanted to sign to fight him
9002330 jeremiah he called us and said i want this fight
9002331 jeremiah is a tough kid hes a guy who is 9 4 but hes 8 1 at 170 pounds
9002332 coming up in his career he took a couple fights in a higher weight for a good payday on short notice and hes a guy that is not boring hes a tough fighter so this has turned into almost a coin flip fight
9002333 we were talking to the wec and they said have bryan baker fight gary padilla because if you dont put it on well put it on later in the year
9002334 so they threw us a bone which is great and theyre all going to be at the show
9002335 were going to become a little bit of a traveling show and doing different cities for the shriners where theyve got good shrine support or a hospital
9002336 so were looking at maybe even three or four a year in different parts of the country
9002337 they dont take one penny from an insurance company its all just done by membership and donations
9002338 in a capitalist economy losers are expected to take losses and winners to gain
9002339 weve all become socialists despite our lip service to the free market
9002340 men must choose between the market economy and socialism they cannot evade deciding between these alternatives
9002341 every step a government takes beyond protecting the smooth operation of the market economy against aggression is a step forward on a road that directly leads into the totalitarian system where there is no freedom at all

9002567 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
9002568 is not just choosing a yes man but a person that will speak what he believes
9002569 protect us from committing acts you wont forgive help us remove this desire and replace it with love
9002570 oh yeah this thing has had constant use up to the point that it broke and they gave up on it
9002571 it worked until a few months ago then just stopped working

9002578 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno

9002584 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
9002585 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try to help people who are hurt through this
9002586 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme

9002599 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
9002600 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
9002601 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
9002602 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales

9002611 expresa de las empresas que han solicitado la importaci n del material gen ticamente modificado
9002612 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9002613 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9002614 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9002615 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9002616 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9002617 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9002618 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9002619 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
9002620 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
9002621 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
9002622 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
9002623 todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso
9002624 en chile no hay presos pol ticos las personas que est n privadas de libertad todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso
9002625 se alaba que las c rceles concesionadas visit santiago 1 y rancagua est n en la primera l nea de lo que l ha visto en el continente no solamente en sudam rica
9002626 no hay en ning n caso en chile pr ctica de torturas ni en ning n caso permisividad o complacencia o hacer la vista a un lado en caso de malos tratos si es necesario son investigados y sancionados si corresponde
9002627 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

9002631 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
9002632 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9002633 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
9002634 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9002635 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
9002636 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
9002637 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
9002638 la escuela en un alto grado es una fuente de cultivo para el racismo la discriminaci n la negaci n de todo lo mapuche
9002639 los derechos educativos y ling sticos son parte importante de los derechos colectivos de nuestro pueblo naci n mapuche reconocidos por la legislaci n internacional en varios instrumentos convenio 169 oit convenci n de los derechos del ni o declaraci n de diversidad cultural unesco declaraci n de la onu derechos pueblos ind genas y que en el proyecto lge del gobierno no son expresados reflejando una vez mas la sistem tica pol tica de violaci n a nuestros derechos pol ticos como pueblo naci n mapuche por parte de la institucionalidad racista del estado chileno

9002646 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
9002647 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9002648 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno

9002653 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9002654 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9002655 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9002656 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9002657 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

9002664 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece

9002666 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9002667 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

9002677 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9002678 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9002679 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9002680 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9002681 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9002682 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

9002715 i knew the first time i saw this team that that was an issue
9002716 our job as coaches is to immediately correct that practice habits and if we continue to do that during the season by the time we get to november we can be a good football team we are not the most talented team in the league by any stretch of the imagination but we have enough talent to be a good football team and when you are a good football team you can carry the game to the fourth quarter and find a way to win games

9002742 being able to quantify the speed with which populations are able to adapt to these sort of selection pressures is essential for formulating comprehensive policy about climate change
9002743 thats the great thing about stickleback they dont require much prodding to produce a lot of offspring
9002744 these ideas about natural selection and how that affects evolution have been around all the way back to darwin 150 years ago but what he didnt have was any knowledge of genetics
9002745 were only now getting to the stage that we can pinpoint the genes that are responsible for morphological traits that help a species survive and deal with changing environments
9002746 we really need to actually put numbers on these things
9002747 if we exceed those thresholds the species is going to be in trouble and itll go extinct
9002748 the young workman who saw it was astounded and shouted land mine
9002749 archeologists must explain why such a group was found outside the extensive royal cemetery
9002750 they must also work out why the bones of the unknown but not insignificant person were hidden in the citys most public and sacred area
9002751 the total number of individuals nonsuited is 253 including the 26 disputed minors
9002752 the nonsuits are part of the process as we continue to work through the cases the investigation continues and those findings we have yet to announce
9002753 the lawsuits are in a different category were nonsuiting those as we work through them
9002754 the foster parents i am with are nice amp treat me well
9002755 nothing is the same as home but pretty soon i will be with you which is the happiest place to be
9002756 may our loving heavenly father hear our fervant prayers and comfort us i know he is doing it and will allow us to be together once again
9002757 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9002758 proof that all the very well connected journalists know absolutely nothing
9002759 it has been forty years since someone as inexperienced as sarah palin has been put on a national ticket
9002760 mr taboada was not only aware of the assaults but facilitated them
9002761 surgical procedures so that she could be impregnated with his sperm so that she could bear his child
9002762 he admitted he had done more than hugging and kissing
9002763 viewers of cbs early show yesterday were treated to a sight arguably more extraordinary than swimmer michael phelps procurement of eight gold medals at the 2008 olympics in beijing
9002764 however the nature of the experience couldnt be more different palin spent her entire political career crusading against the political machine that rules alaska which exists in her own republican party she blew the whistle on the state gop chair who had abused his power on the same commission to conduct party business obama in contrast talked a great deal about reform in chicago but never challenged the party machine preferring to take an easy ride as a proteg of richard daley instead
9002765 governor palin has spent her time in office shaking up government in alaska and actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9002766 town of 9 000 which pretty much keeps pace with their previously stated view of
9002767 if we continue to follow this slippery oil slicked downward winding path our citizens will shiver in darkness as our resources hemorrhage to third world thugs whose only virtue is their control of petroleum based energy
9002768 the risks of course are that she is an unknown has never been in the national spotlight has no foreign policy experience and represents an absolute republican cesspool of a state her being under ethics scrutiny thie early in her term probably does not help much on that front
9002769 if we continue to follow this slippery oil slicked downward winding path our citizens will shiver in darkness as our resources hemorrhage to third world thugs whose only virtue is their control of petroleum based energy
9002770 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9002771 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9002772 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9002773 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9002774 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9002775 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9002776 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9002777 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9002778 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9002779 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9002780 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9002781 what the heck is windows doing for two minutes after booting that makes it still totally unusable
9002782 other perceptions that users deem as reflecting boot time such as when the disk stops when their apps are fully responsive or when the start menu and desktop can be used
9002783 today senator john mccain sent a strong message to washington in choosing alaska governor sarah palin to be his running mate she has executive experience a passion for change and brings a strong record of reform and challenging the status quo
9002784 governor palin has served alaska well maintaining an 80 approval rating and has a proven record of bringing people together and getting things done
9002785 if we continue to follow this slippery oil slicked downward winding path our citizens will shiver in darkness as our resources hemorrhage to third world thugs whose only virtue is their control of petroleum based energy

9002790 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
9002791 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
9002792 he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
9002793 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equaling spitzs record
9002794 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
9002795 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before
9002796 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that
9002797 hes accomplished so much already he wants to accomplish more
9002798 he better bring his a game because us sprint boys are a different league and we are not going go easy on him
9002799 the team has distanced itself from his misdemeanor and has canceled his contract with immediate effect until the
9002800 as the commission proceeds it is my hope that it gives all due consideration to all proposals concerning the best use of the white spaces including those proposals to license some or all of the available spectrum
9002801 it is possible that a licensing regime could help mitigate the impact of harmful interference to incumbents in this spectrum these particular bands of spectrum are extraordinarily valuable and offer the potential for entirely new and innovation services i urge the commission to carefully and deliberately weigh each proposal prior to reaching any tentative or preliminary conclusions
9002802 there is no evidence for the claim the tv white space would spur innovation in unlicensed applications
9002803 although unlicensed spectrum can provide a good home for low power short range systems and thus facilitate innovation in such systems the tv white space is overqualified for such applications devoting tv spectrum to low power short range systems is like using land in downtown tokyo to grow rice
9002804 there have been a significant number of experiments with unlicensed wi fi in major metropolitan areas including san francisco philadelphia and portland
9002805 in every instance these experiments have been a failure or were shot down before they started they have not failed due to a lack of funding
9002806 grant me o lord my god a mind to know you a heart to seek you wisdom to find you conduct pleasing to you faithful perseverance in waiting for you and a hope of finally embracing you

9002814 believe the separation between past present and future is only an illusion
9002815 henceforth space by itself and time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere shadows and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality
9002816 nobody has ever noticed a place except at a time
9002817 your first job is to identify what you mean by time
9002818 i showed that you could make different choices of what you mean by time and get any laws of physics you want
9002819 we tried to show that there was something wrong with this picture that the freedom to choose any clock would somehow contradict itself
9002820 the clock ambiguity suggests that we must view physical laws as emergent from a random ensemble of all possible laws
9002821 quasiseparability means the universe can be separated into different things different objects that have their own identity
9002822 thats how we stay safe in a universe full of potentially antagonistic physical objects
9002823 the fact that you can do something to adult cells to reprogram them was absolutely novel
9002824 it goes against everything that everyone had ever thought about the abilities of adult cells
9002825 you never could have made a reprogrammed cell without an embryonic stem cell to compare to to tell you what a pluripotent cell was
9002826 still very preliminary and they will need a lot of work before you can say that they would be better or equivalent to embryonic stem cells
9002827 theyre called ips cells but they are es cells as far as im concerned
9002828 i would say theyre not entirely the same but theyre pretty close
9002829 we can always tell you if a cell falls into that category or not its very clear
9002830 people who have looked at reprogrammed cells before have gotten the impression that they are different but this shows that theyre the same
9002831 if they hadnt been labeled i wouldnt have been able to tell them apart from embryonic stem cells
9002832 the fda brings a whole extra level of scrutiny when theres this genetic modification of cells
9002833 before it was four genes now were down to one and its only been about two years
9002834 we were surprised that it wasnt really difficult at all
9002835 we dont know really how long these inducing factors have to be around in order to reprogram the cells
9002836 if you dont do it for long enough you might as well not have done it
9002837 you cannot use converted cells on their own for anything
9002838 you still have to differentiate the cells into something for it to be useful
9002839 this is going to be a huge issue before it will be clinically applicable
9002840 this is an active group of genes that are doing something together
9002841 one possibility is that we dont really understand imprinting as well as we thought we did
9002842 the other possibility is that imprinting in embryonic stem cells is not stable
9002843 the real mechanism must be shared between species so were trying to look at whats common
9002844 one second of him falling asleep and we will suffer for the rest of our lives
9002845 it looked like it was purposeful it was going very fast i dont know if he the driver fell asleep but there were no brakes
9002846 let me say to the people of mississippi this is not a time to panic but it is a time to get prepared

9002859 we are trying with mbeki to get zanu pf to be flexible because there has not been any indication of movement of flexibility on the part of zanu pf
9002860 just with the south african mediators there is no zanu pf
9002861 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political and outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
9002862 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humanitarian crisis
9002863 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground

9002881 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9002882 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
9002883 insurance is like marriage you pay and pay but you never get anything back

9002896 the creative energy lost trying to obey all of the rules
9002897 you need to get a certificate of need if you want to build a health care facility
9002898 which means you have to know how to game the system thats what they did in the former soviet union
9002899 and yet the competition brings us cars that are much better than a planned economy can produce but west virginia politicians think they know best when it comes to health care
9002900 but look at the greedy profit driven companies that have employed me
9002901 ive worked for all three networks who get all of their profits from advertisers all of the networks have boards of censors they demand wording changes in almost half of the advertisements sometimes they even turn down money why because they realized they can make more money if their ad time is not seen as an environment for sleaze so they police themselves
9002902 they sued for 20 million i thought i was toast i was 25 years old
9002903 in case after case ive found the market protects us better than regulation
9002904 to protect us from ourselves but if this is right we should have exercise police we should outlaw steak and ice cream

9002913 foreign policy i repeat is not an exercise in moralism we assisted in the conversion of rhodesia into zimbabwe with much fulsome talk about human rights addressed to the former government because america needs the mineral resources of that country and our statesmen calculated that it might be possible to detach the major black faction from soviet influence however imperfect the fulfillment of human rights in rhodesia justice and civil liberty are being extinguished altogether in zimbabwe i find it distasteful to cloak the national interest in grandiose phrases about human rights what we were after really was the chromium not the establishment of a paradise of human rights in the heart of africa

9002930 governor sarah palin brings a strong conservative pro taxpayer and pro life record to the republican ticket she is a reformer with results and her executive experience compliments john mccains military service
9002931 sarah palins reforms in alaska go hand in hand with john mccains maverick record in the u s senate on cutting spending and reigning in the out of control federal budget governor palin brings a record of executive leadership and reform that the democratic ticket completely lacks neither obama nor biden have a single shred of executive or military experience the harvard law review simply isnt enough to qualify one for president of the united states
9002932 governor palin also adds an obvious benefit that senator joe biden cant possibly provide namely that shes held jobs in the private sector sometime in the last 35 years
9002933 well give it to mary shell take it she never gets anything
9002934 there were no signs of trauma or foul play well be doing toxicology and other tests which will take up to six weeks
9002935 i made this record to talk about what is going on in the world today
9002936 we are dealing with a recession and i know a lot of people feel helpless in a way i consciously decided to try to give a voice to those who feel voiceless in the world
9002937 its going down after my album drops could be the beginning of next year like january february
9002938 i was a huge fan im still a huge fan of the slippery when wet album
9002939 and i love that talk box sound and i wanted to do a rock remix but i wanted it to be official and i wanted to do it with someone who im a fan of
9002940 i thought it would be real hot for those who appreciate that type of music the majority of artists theyd rather be safe
9002941 if allhiphop was around when i need love came out that wouldnt have been a great song for that
9002942 that audience for the most part is not really big fans of my love songs but i do them anyway and i see the comments and i do them after i see the comments so its about believing in what you do and not letting people sway you
9002943 its an incredible time to be around i wish my momma could have seen this day
9002944 with obama we make history if you ready for obama make some noise yo man lets do this for obama
9002945 i thought he was a really cool person and this was way before he was even a presidential candidate and i liked him a lot he invited me to washington and i went we talked about boxing were both boxing fanatics and when i talked to him i never felt beneath him he looks directly at me when hes speaking to me and we have the same level of respect for each other
9002946 theres no one in this room believe it or not who wants finality for the citizens of campton hills more than i
9002947 i believe that the jurisdictional problem is the major issue here
9002948 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
9002949 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
9002950 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
9002951 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
9002952 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
9002953 where the speech and the crowd came alive was in the area obama has used so effectively in the past specifically in his 2004 democratic convention keynote address
9002954 the old partisan playbook wont do republicans try to tear democrats down but patriotism has no party we all put our country first we must bridge divides and unite in common effort all in all a muted affair but not one without power
9002955 on this historic day of course martin luther king beckoned
9002956 borrowing the anaphora now is the time which cannot be uttered without evoking the righteous rumble of kings words only to marry the phrase with a laundry list of american unobjectionables well now we know how mlks state of the union would have sounded at least obama had the sense to leave the fierce urgency of now for the ages
9002957 obamas speech last night was very different from the sort of lyrical orations that have characterized his campaign so far
9002958 it was a much more traditional political speech less lofty more focused less general talk of hope and more old fashioned bashing of the opposition as a result it risked undermining senator obamas message so far that he stands for a different kind of politics one able to transcend political divisions while it addressed many of the problems that have weakened his campaign in recent weeks it may in the end have done some new damage perhaps sen obama is just another politician after all
9002959 it was a deeply substantive speech full of policy detail full of people other than the candidate centered overwhelmingly on domestic economic anxiety
9002960 it was a liberal speech more unabashedly unashamedly liberal than any democratic acceptance speech since the great era of american liberalism but it made the case for that liberalism in the context of the decline of the american dream and the rise of cynicism and the collapse of cultural unity what he didnt do was give an airy abstract dreamy confection of rhetoric
9002961 obama avoided soaring rhetoric until the final moments of the address perhaps for fear that an address heavy on oratory would be picked apart by republicans as more evidence that he is heavy on style and light on substance
9002962 he personalized he humanized he dramatized that is so important for the listener and viewer to be able to connect with the person who is speaking

9002966 estaba all en plena final intentando no sonre r espa a era nuestro rival pero yo estaba fascinado viendo jugar a mi jugador

9002971 legal sites i e sites devoted to fantasy sports online lotteries and horse harness racing the effect of this act has been to move most internet gambling sites off shore and to create confusion for financial institutions whose clients seek to use such sites
9002972 ambiguity as to what sort of transactions are to be blocked
9002973 the definition of what constitutes unlawful internet gambling is inadequate and must be rectified
9002974 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9002975 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9002976 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9002977 we regret that we missed the opportunity to tell matthew mitchams story we apologize for this unintentional omission
9002978 they failed to mention that the problem was dealing with anxiety and depression associated with coming out of the closet
9002979 however the higher ups at nbc sports decided that all these bits of information were not ready for prime time
9002980 the omission shows a sore lack of sound news judgment
9002981 you could argue that his sexual orientation has nothing to do with the competition but then again neither does what michael phelps eats for breakfast that divers david boudia and thomas finchum are roommates or that the decathlon prepared bryan clay for being a father all of which were mentioned more than once
9002982 i just want to be known as the australian diver who did really well at the olympics
9002983 we she and husband todd understand that every innocent life has wonderful potential
9002984 and the republican convention will take place next week pundits have been saying that republicans have the advantage in going second but im thinking that the democratic convention in general and obamas extraordinary speech in particular have thrown so much truth at the republicans that they may not have the time to catch up
9002985 pero desgraciadamente el concejo las bancadas del fsln y plc tomaron otra decisi n y mand a comisi n la iniciativa lo que significa que ellos los miembros de la comisi n de gobernabilidad van a valorar si la rotonda llevar a no el nombre de sandino
9002986 yo considero que eso es absurdo que existan miembros del concejo municipal que deben evaluar la figura y el pensamiento del general de hombres libres y por eso dije en la sesi n que era una verg enza que se hubiera dado esa situaci n
9002987 el cual creemos que no se deben seguir haciendo con las iniciativas del alcalde
9002988 hasta el d a de la sesi n del concejo todo marchaba normal
9002989 ahora un sandinista como nicho marenco que quer a hacerle un monumento al h roe por lo que no le veo raz n de que tenga que critic rsele
9002990 no deben bajo ninguna circunstancia negar que esa rotonda lleve el nombre de sandino y no deben de cometer el error de guardar esa solicitud del edil y dej rselo a otra administraci n
9002991 el villarreal ya no es un equipo m s es un equipo importante el equipo quiere ganar alg n t tulo y espero que con ello este a o el club d un paso adelante
9002992 hice un partido correcto y estoy feliz de estar en tercera ronda en el primer set he jugado bien pegando buenos golpes de derecha en el segundo l ha entrado un poco m s en juego y en le tercero ha empezado a jugar mejor pero lo importante es que con el 3 0 en contra he sabido reaccionar a tiempo para ganarlo
9002993 los partidos nocturnos son bonitos pero acabas muy tarde y entre la tensi n del partido siempre te duermes muy tarde
9002994 est jugando muy bien y hace poco hizo final en washington por lo que ha venido con confianza es un jugador que saca muy bien tiene golpes fuertes y agresivos habr que estar muy atentos jugar agresivo y sacar bien para que sienta la presi n

9002996 report comes amid a backdrop of legislative distrust about the departments financial projections
9002997 although the department asserts it briefed all commission members individually no briefing documents specific dates or calendars were provided to auditors to verify these briefings
9002998 i am committed to increasing the departments transparency and the recommendations identified in this audit put us another step closer to realizing that goal
9002999 the people of texas deserve a world class transportation system
9003000 im hopeful this report along with recommendations made by the sunset commission will provide the legislature with a good roadmap for making immediate and long term improvements to our transportation system
9003001 however i must admit i am dismayed to learn that there were persons in the department who became aware of this error as early as september 2007 and yet it was not brought to the legislatures attention until early this year
9003002 betting favor of polluting the edwards aquifer and paving the hill country
9003003 if you are projecting decades of substantial traffic growth along u s 281 and then taking on debt based on those projections then you are basically betting in favor of polluting the aquifer and paving the hill country
9003004 i said thank you very much i want a specific gas price analysis
9003005 the question is whether the current trend will continue for a longer period
9003006 although the effects of the error were discussed the specific error and the causes were not discussed
9003007 the department txdot should brief the full texas transportation commission on developments that occur and have a significant statewide impact so that members of the commission can be involved in the process of making corrections
9003008 when we had an explanation of what happened we brought it to the legislature in early february
9003009 already well underway for several of the recommendations i am committed to increasing the departments transparency and the recommendations identified in this audit put us another step closer to realizing that goal

9003023 a man id just started dating knew every intimate detail of a rather wild night id had in the course of my previous romantic relationship
9003024 i immediately went to the site to discover that every one of my confessions for the past three years was posted along with those of my fellow churchgoers ive never been so humiliated in my life
9003025 we are suing for breach of con fidence public humiliation damage to reputation and emotional trauma
9003026 although this is currently under investigation we believe that a disgruntled churchgoer secretly bugged the confessional then sold the information to the web site
9003027 we had deployed a small remote camera to explore parts of the ship that had not been seen since it struck the iceberg and went down in 1912 suddenly in one of the passenger cabins deep in the belly of the ship we peeked through a porthole and saw three faces
9003028 at first they seemed terrified of us running here and there but always returning to the porthole
9003029 i wrote on a piece of paper holding it up and apologizing for the intrusion when we indicated that we were from the surface they became very curious they drew a map that showed us how to reach them
9003030 so was dripping water which collected in a little freshwater pond we exited the submarine and walked to the titanic apparently when the ship struck the bottom a portion of the keel crashed through the underwater cavern it fit so snugly that seawater didnt leak through
9003031 he explained that they were the third and fourth generation descendants of two couples who had been in adjoining cabins when the ship went down
9003032 they had survived the sinking but were unable to return to the surface
9003033 there were enough supplies to last until they learned how to fish and gather water in the cave
9003034 there were 10 children who ranged in age from 3 to 10
9003035 they all seemed perfectly at ease in their undersea house they were fascinated by the camera and kept making faces for it they knew about moving pictures from the original survivors but not about radio or television
9003036 our grandparents talked about the out side world about the greed the wars the disease we prefer to remain here we have everything we need
9003037 i wished i could have told them that things have gotten better on the surface but they havent
9003038 he has pick a right wing nut that will never appeal to the majority of clinton supporters

9003041 you act like i care about who wins i have stated many times that i will not vote
9003042 the world would be a better place if everyone just sent out 3 bumper stickers a week ya know
9003043 thats the so called open fair trial i think people get whats going on lets see how this thing gets a happy ending
9003044 yesterday i wrote one about why the shanghai court didnt put the notice of the trials schedule on its web site which the law says they should do three days in advance
9003045 your generation dont know how to write because all you do is type on the computer
9003046 i argue against putting too much weight on prediction markets
9003047 which i think are interesting but not of tremendous political value or somehow more predictive that good polling data
9003048 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
9003049 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
9003050 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music

9003165 there is some kind of engagement to have some understanding of where we are because its not clear whether the talks have collapsed or are still on
9003166 the mediator has to help us appreciate where we are in terms of locating a way forward
9003167 we are trying with mbeki to get zanu pf to be flexible because there has not been any indication of movement of flexibility on the part of zanu pf
9003168 just with the south african mediators there is no zanu pf
9003169 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political and outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
9003170 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humanitarian crisis
9003171 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground

9003203 we think the energy business is going to go through an extraordinary transformation in the next couple of years
9003204 the firm has made this one of its highest priorities
9003205 alston amp bird will of course have the usual integration issues to align everyone on its higher financial metrics and goals and time will tell how this goes
9003206 we wouldnt do it if it didnt make financial sense
9003207 investing more time energy and thought into how to deal with the fact that gas costs 4 a gallon and theres global warming
9003208 that drives a lot of whats going on in the economy and we think there will be a lot more of that over the course of the next decade
9003209 alaska needs to be self sufficient she says instead of relying heavily on federal dollars as the state does today
9003210 did not turn out to be a team player on budgeting issues
9003211 a s for that v p talk all the time i ll tell you i still can t answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day i m used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that v p slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that we re trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question
9003212 the game plan has been set by the prime minister
9003213 we explained our positions and he will consider them i told him what our position was on all of the issues now i think that beyond that he is determined to have an election

9003244 unjustifiably interfered with defendants relationship with counsel and their ability to mount a defense in violation of the sixth amendment
9003245 kpmg faced ruin by indictment and reasonably believed it must do everything in its power to avoid it
9003246 the governments threat of indictment was easily sufficient to convert its adversary into its agent kpmg was not in a position to consider coolly the risk of indictment weigh the potential significance of the other enumerated factors in the thompson memorandum and decided for itself how to proceed
9003247 and if the sixth amendment prohibits the government from interfering with such arrangements then surely it also prohibits the government from interfering with financial donations by others such as family members and neighbors and employers
9003248 as if it had never experienced the governments pressure in the first place

9003251 the government will assess neither a credit nor a penalty based on whether the disclosed materials are protected by the attorney client privilege or attorney work product

9003261 i walk frequently when i play i love to exercise outside
9003262 golf is a thinking game its one of the challenges where youre playing against yourself
9003263 i could always slam the ball and get on the green but usually three putted
9003264 i play tennis and golf and love competing as most lawyers do golf is extremely challenging i like challenging sports
9003265 my nursing education and medical knowledge are very helpful in the area of law that i practice
9003266 golf is excellent for meeting people and developing new clients
9003267 they have women members of all golfing abilities its a great opportunity to play golf network and socialize
9003268 i can drive the ball 200 yards but i need lessons in chipping and putting
9003269 if i can get down to two putts i would be dangerous thats my goal

9003272 but i am sure if he starts scoring and in december is on 15 or 20 goals everything will be fine
9003273 the big thing is to feel you are wanted from your club your manager your team mates and the fans
9003274 i think the most newcastle fans had hoped to go into the game against arsenal with would be three points you know we havent won at old trafford in the league since 1971 72 and not many of us expected us to win there even though we were conscious that united were a bit short upfront we still thought theyd have enough to beat newcastle but on the day we fully deserved the draw at old trafford and actually played better there than we did against bolton the funny thing is that newcastle are going to arsenal above them in the league table and nobody would have thought that possible
9003275 michael owen is massively important to newcastles season whatever may or may not be said about michael he is still one of the greatest goalscorers in world football today when he came on against bolton in the 53rd minute newcastle hadnt managed a shot on target all game he changed all that and then he scored the winner lo and behold at coventry it was two apiece and michael came on for the last 15 minutes of normal time we were a bit disappointed he didnt get on earlier because the last thing we wanted was extra time what with coming to arsenal on saturday he didnt manage that but michael pops up and scores the winner in the first period of extra time instead he is a great goalscorer and a proper captain an inspiration
9003276 newcastle fans were expecting big names and id never heard about jonas gutierrez but ive got to say ive seen him play in all the pre season games and i have to say i like this lad
9003277 fabrizio coloccini is also an argentinian its good that weve got two argentinians coming in together to help each other
9003278 as for danny guthrie i was talking to stuart pearce before the game at coventry and he said one of the reasons he was there at the ricoh was to have a little look at guthrie for the under 21s he hasnt made the squad for the portugal game next friday but pearce is looking now and youll find keegans delighted with him hes not the player thatll catch the eye but at the end of the game hes done more running and beavered away more than any other player in a black and white shirt
9003279 i expect shay given in goal habib beye at right back hes not a bad player the lad from senegal an excellent right back jose enrique played left back at coventry and he actually did ok and made the winning goal for owen the two centre halves weve talked about nicky butt will be a banker in midfield guthrie is a banker and much depends on how many strikers keegan picks they played with one at old trafford but two at coventry i presume owen will start on saturday keegan only wanted to give him 15 minutes at coventry but of course he ended up playing the whole of extra time so he will start youve got to presume that james milner and charles nzogbia will start because keegan doesnt have that many options the squad is still quite thin

9003350 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
9003351 an energy subsidy is any government action that influences energy market outcomes by lowering the cost of energy production raising the price received by energy producers or lowering the price paid by energy consumers
9003352 a good subsidy is one that enhances access to sustainable modern energy or has a positive impact on the environment while sustaining incentives for efficient delivery and consumption

9003440 they move their legs around to reposition their bodies so that when they do jump they will push themselves away from the looming threat
9003441 you should anticipate that theyre going to jump away from you so you should extend your swat in the direction of the flys anticipated motion
9003442 when you see a fly flitting around your hair or your potato salad you might see an annoyance
9003443 but in my lab you really see a marvelous machine arguably the most sophisticated flying device on the planet
9003444 i had to sell them in order to pursue this case

9003453 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9003454 im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9003455 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9003456 but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
9003457 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow

9003465 we set a new record in attendance and money collected folks bid generously in our silent auction and were thrilled at the strength of our community support for the tbtf foundation
9003466 i can tell you a lot about gov palin just from my conversation with her and from the day that we spent with her and that is she challenged the establishment in
9003467 she is very very popular in and what she brings to the table predominantly is her knowledge and her know how of energy thats the bottom line
9003468 in an environment where energy is probably the number two after the economy and housing issue in this election she is really a terrific choice for mccain here
9003469 shes also obviously a terrific choice because shes a woman trying to attract those hillary voters now and those supporters
9003470 we talked about energy as the key issue and i asked her directly did john mccain approach you to be his running mate
9003471 you know she answered me really very sheepishly saying well weve spoken many times about a number of issues and weve spoken recently obviously about energy
9003472 and i was impressed at the time with her attitude you know she wasnt sucking up to it shes saying well wait a minute i got a good job here

9003474 the plan was to get a couple of three and outs and then take the players out but it didnt turn out that way we didnt play well believe me if we could put our finger on it we would have done something about it before now weve got a little bit more time to get it right
9003475 we havent played well that is all you can say about it we have not made all the effort we need to play well all the things that go into playing well we havent done once we get all our guys going i feel we will have a very strong defense

9003479 millions of customers have now upgraded to hdtvs but as they add more sources like blu ray players portable media cable boxes and satellite receivers they find themselves running out of ways to connect them to their tv
9003480 and then once theyve lived with hd picture quality they want to find a way to raise the level of picture quality from lower resolution sources to match the capabilities of their hd display the edge was designed to seamlessly answer these challenges by connecting and enhancing all video sources and switch between them with the push of a single button

9003484 the immediate goal is to make sure there are more people on private insurance plans i mean people have access to health care in america
9003485 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
9003486 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
9003487 many persons left their jobs for the more profitable one of selling apples
9003488 p eople have access to health care in america after all you just go to an emergency room
9003489 the continuing degradation of coral reefs may be soon beyond repair if threats are not identified and rapidly controlled
9003490 the human expansion in coastal areas inevitably poses severe risks to the maintenance of complex ecosystems such as coral reefs
9003491 a threat in any one group may escalate to the entire ecosystem
9003492 the array of human stressors is significantly affecting all major groups of coral reef organisms
9003493 similarly atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide co2 in the early carboniferous period were approximately 1500 ppm parts per million but by the middle carboniferous had declined to about 350 ppm comparable to average co2 concentrations today earths atmosphere today contains about 380 ppm co2 0 038 compared to former geologic times our present atmosphere like the late carboniferous atmosphere is co2 impoverished in the last 600 million years of earths history only the carboniferous period and our present age the quaternary period have witnessed co2 levels less than 400 ppm there has historically been much more co2 in our atmosphere than exists today for example during the jurassic period 200 mya average co2 concentrations were about 1800 ppm or about 4 7 times higher than today the highest concentrations of co2 during all of the paleozoic era occurred during the cambrian period nearly 7000 ppm about 18 times higher than today the carboniferous period and the ordovician period were the only geological periods during the paleozoic era when global temperatures were as low as they are today to the consternation of global warming proponents the late ordovician period was also an ice age while at the same time co2 concentrations then were nearly 12 times higher than today 4400 ppm according to greenhouse theory earth should have been exceedingly hot instead global temperatures were no warmer than today clearly other factors besides atmospheric carbon influence earth temperatures and global warming

9003496 huntingdon life sciences a notorious laboratory that conducts the most cruel and awful experiments on animals in the name of science they have been exposed repeatedly by undercover video of abusing the animals in their care not only by carrying out the dreadful experiments but also by mistreating the animals punching them kicking them being in a position of power and control over the animals hls will test anything for anybody they carry out experiments which involve poisoning animals with household products pesticides drugs herbicides food colourings and additives sweeteners and genetically modified organisms they cause so much needless suffering to animals claiming that animal testing is necessary when it is not there are companies out there that dedicate themselves to providing alternative models to using animals in testing and the results are by far more accurate than the misleading animal tests basically huntingdon carries on doing these useless animal tests because it is ignorant of the fact that the truth and the future lie in alternatives to animal testing and they continue to try and justify using animals as test subjects animals are not needed to test on when there are other models to use simply put animal experimentation continues because it is highly profitable all the following constituencies make money scientists physicians hospitals regulation agency bureaucrats pharmaceutical companies medical conglomerates politicians animal farmers and vendors lawyers reporters and news media to name a few other companies whose products may or may not pose human health problems use animal testing to secure themselves against litigation too think asbestos think tobacco none of these constituencies can afford for the public to lose confidence in the idea that animal testing protects them make a stand people sign the petition be the voice that the animals do not have end the torture in the horror chambers

9003503 the exposure of rat fetus pups was not shown to be equivalent to human fetus infant during equivalent stages of brain development
9003504 the current form of the dnt guideline is not a sensitive indicator of toxicity to the offspring
9003505 in the absence of effective validated alternatives wwf believes that limited animal testing is needed for the long term protection of wildlife and people throughout the world
9003506 it is simply not possible with all the animals in the world to go through chemicals in the blind way we have at the present time and reach credible conclusions about the hazards to human health
9003507 wwf is not an animal welfare organization we support the hunting and consumption of wild animals provided the harvesting does not threaten the long term survival of wildlife populations wwf has never opposed a sustainable seal hunt in northern or eastern canada
9003508 wwfs views on whether sustainable whaling should be permitted derive from its mission to conserve nature and ecological processes and to help build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature
9003509 wwf international has the national wwf organizations behind it in the view that as soon as one can ensure a sustainable commercial harvest of the great whales under secure international control then whaling will no longer be a wwf concern
9003510 the decision to allow trophy hunting is a sovereign one made entirely by the governments concerned we will continue to monitor governments enforcement of important trade laws to ensure that trophy hunting is done within the legal standards of that area
9003511 the decision to cull or to select animals from the herd for removal or death is indeed an agonizing choice but it is one made entirely by the governments concerned and there is no international involvement in those decisions

9003523 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america

9003528 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9003529 after his attacks on obamas readiness for the job itll be amusing to hear a 71 year old with a history of health problems justify this decision
9003530 well it shouldnt disqualify me from anything including progressing the states agenda here towards more energy production so we can contribute more to the u s nor should it dissuade any kind of agenda progress in any arena because again i havent done anything wrong and through an investigation of our lawmakers who are kind of looking at me as a target we invite those questions so that we can truthfully answer the questions
9003531 shes a strong pro life supply side drill drill drill ethics reformer who has worked hard to change the ted stevens culture of corruption problem in alaska

9003545 its a daring pick but i think a very weak pick im perfectly happy with it palin is in the midst of a reasonably serious scandal in her home state her brother in law is a state trooper who is in the midst of an ugly custody battle with her sister and shes accused of getting the state police to fire him
9003546 palin is a strong conservative opposing abortion rights and enjoying a life membership in the nra
9003547 she has no foreign policy experience whatsoever shes also entirely untested on the national political stage
9003548 the triumph came in alaska where sarah palin a politician of eye popping integrity was elected governor she is now the most popular governor in america with an approval rating in the 90s and probably the most popular public official in any state her rise is a great and rare story of how adherence to principle especially to transparency and accountability in government can produce political success
9003549 otros miembros del consejo se han dirigido a m para saber si estaba al tanto de esta medida y les he explicado que me ha sorprendido tanto como a ellos y que lo he sabido al mismo tiempo lo que s es que en la historia del consejo antes consejo nacional de especialidades cne nunca se nos ha impedido hablar o se nos ha pedido de forma tan expl cita que no hagamos declaraciones
9003550 en los cuatro a os que yo presid el consejo nunca se nos condicion y por eso esta carta me resulta sorprendente me parece una medida cuando menos intervencionista un atentado contra la libertad de expresi n de los presidentes al intentar limitarles en su capacidad de hacer declaraciones
9003551 lo primero que voy a hacer pero como presidente de farmacolog a es dirigirme a ellos y pedirles explicaciones sobre los motivos que les han llevado a enviarnos la carta a m se me escapa y no se me ocurre ninguna pero pueden tener alguna raz n algo grave que haya ocurrido y yo desconozco
9003552 opinar y hacer declaraciones sobre cualquier otro asunto es un derecho que asiste ya no al presidente de una comisi n sino a cualquier de sus miembros pero si adem s el asunto se refiere directamente a la especialidad no s lo tiene ese derecho sino que tiene el deber de hacerlo
9003553 no s qu har n los dem s pero como puede usted comprobar yo estoy haci ndole declaraciones en este momento con eso creo que queda todo dicho
9003554 el 9 3 por ciento de los pacientes que ingresan en un centro hospitalario sufre alg n efecto adverso siendo las causas m s frecuentes la medicaci n las infecciones asociadas a la asistencia hospitalaria y aquellos relacionados con problemas t cnicos sobre todo ligados a intervenciones quir rgicas
9003555 esta cifra puede bajar y campa as tan sencillas como promover el lavado de manos de los profesionales se han revelado altamente eficaces
9003556 los avances sociosanitarios han generado un acceso universal de la poblaci n a la asistencia sanitaria y un aumento de la longevidad lo que ha generado un incremento y masificaci n de la actividad sanitaria y una mayor complejidad y agresividad asistencial
9003557 esta situaci n conlleva una p rdida de seguridad que esta cobrando en los ltimos a os una gran consideraci n en nuestro entorno se calcula que la mortalidad anual producida por los efectos adversos en estados unidos es de unos 90 000 pacientes lo que constituye un problema sanitario de primera ndole
9003558 las autonom as est n solas en la pista y no se acuerdan de que hay municipios que reclaman financiaci n

9003564 zapatero la ha puesto en marcha sin la financiaci n necesaria es decir que est sujeta a convenios anuales y esa irresponsabilidad ha supuesto crear unas expectativas que finalmente se han visto defraudadas
9003565 she knows when to stand up and doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9003566 obama is merely a celebrity rock star not a viable presidential candidate
9003567 now i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped my life and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
9003568 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
9003569 obama is against gun rights and he might take away my guns
9003570 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
9003571 places like redzikowo or slupsk perhaps will arouse more interest in the event of a conflict
9003572 but for certain theyll be better protected than any other place in poland
9003573 it wouldnt occur to me not to come because theres an installation
9003574 for women leaning to mccain because theyre so angry that the democratic party ignored women i think it could have an impact
9003575 mccain is stepping on obamas historic democratic convention by doing it today
9003576 if the gallup and rasmussen daily tracking polls arent giving obama a solid lead by next tuesday after the long weekend by which i mean 6 7 points or more i will be surprised and nervous
9003577 we are receiving many emails asking what happens if in fact senator obama is forced to step down or is removed as the democratic nominee for this reason we have posted the democratic national comittees 2008 call rules and regulations pertaining to replacement of a democratic nominee
9003578 the national chairperson of the democratic national committee shall confer with the democratic leadership of the united states congress and the democratic governors association and shall report to the democratic national committee which is authorized to fill the vacancy or vacancies
9003579 it was a deeply substantive speech full of policy detail full of people other than the candidate centered overwhelmingly on domestic economic anxiety
9003580 what he didnt do was give an airy abstract dreamy confection of rhetoric
9003581 if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check
9003582 i may not agree with all of his policies but i think his message of hope for our country means more
9003583 its hard to imagine there are people in this country that can not at least feel inspired by obama even if they do not plan to vote for him
9003584 ive said it before months and months ago i should say it again tonight this is a remarkable man at a vital moment america would be crazy to throw this opportunity away america must not throw this opportunity away
9003585 it doesnt matter what we do drill research alternative energy raise cafe standards in 2018 well still be using oil
9003586 even if we discovered a magic source of clean renewable energy tomorrow wed still be using a lot of oil because transitions of that magnitude take time
9003587 from a democratic perspective he made the argument for government something we havent heard in a while
9003588 moved into ample detail on what he wants to do with the economy and made the case for a failed bush mccain foreign policy
9003589 ive been looking for the details for a while and while not a wonky speech there was enough there there to hang your hat on
9003590 and perhaps most importantly he defended himself and put the screws to the republican party for the failure of the last eight years on the question of being ready to be commander in chief obama answered the question with a clarity and passion i havent seen from him yet
9003591 any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic by those who dont understand it
9003592 or something like that and electric cars and solar power are just too advanced for a lot of people
9003593 the weak do speak their minds but as always only by our grace and pretty soon well remind them after all it was never a question of right and wrong it has always been a matter of who is more willing to fight
9003594 if obama does get elected and does 1 3 of the smooth talking b s that comes from his lips i will donate my intire life savings to his next run for office
9003595 you are correct my friend we are suppose to have the power but liberal looneytoones are slowly taken our rights away one by one
9003596 it doesnt matter what we do drill research alternative energy raise cafe standards in 2018 well still be using oil
9003597 even if we discovered a magic source of clean renewable energy tomorrow wed still be using a lot of oil because transitions of that magnitude take time
9003598 in ten years oil will primarily be used for plastics and other synthetic materials other than for cars in places like cuba and maybe 20 of the us i think it will take no more than 5 years for solar power to be feasible and about the same time for electric cars to become viable and once the transition begins it will turn into a torrent as gas stations go out of business and people convert their gas powered cars to electric
9003599 hitler gave great speaches too he offered hope and change to the war weary germans he packed large stadium venues and would have been considered a top celebrity follwed and worshiped by millions is change always good
9003600 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education
9003601 of the people by the people and for the people
9003602 but if given the chance i e school vouchers i would say the majority of parents would do a better job designing their childs educating then any overworked and underpaid school administration teachers
9003603 ive never felt this way before i am so inspired from the inside out
9003604 obama is the best thing that has happened to this country
9003605 the us is about each of us not just about leaders we are the people we are supposed to have the power
9003606 and no i am not a racist but all my middle aged white male friends are
9003607 the man who promises everything is sure to fulfil nothing and everyone who promises too much is in danger of using evil means in order to carry out his promises and is already on the road to perdition
9003608 i think rush limbaugh should run and your right clinton didnt do much of anything but display democrats awesome moral values and ride reagans coat tails in to the prosperous economy
9003609 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen
9003610 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9003611 this barrack hussein obama guy will destroy america one failed expensive policy at a time you cant just keep saying ill do this and ill do that it costs money idiot god help us all i hope this ass face does not get elected
9003612 plus since when is it our duty to tell other countries how to form their governments let them make their own decisions or is that not your definition of freedom
9003613 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
9003614 in those cases you are talking about a scale of engineering that you cant even imagine
9003615 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back

9003617 im really fascinated by the anthropological aspects of archaeology what the heritage cultures leave behind and how we collect that knowledge through the traces they leave at some point all civilizations even our own are reduced to cultural fragments those that come later are only left with silent partial objects and they have to create the story around them

9003720 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
9003721 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
9003722 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
9003723 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
9003724 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats

9003736 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
9003737 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
9003738 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
9003739 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
9003740 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
9003741 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
9003742 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
9003743 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
9003744 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
9003745 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
9003746 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
9003747 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
9003748 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
9003749 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
9003750 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
9003751 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

9003755 online video ad spend is to surge by 89 in 2007 and is poised to grow and in 2010 will be worth around 2 9 billion
9003756 most advertisers feel that the content for a video advert can be borrowed from their own tv commercials however this is not the case one needs to clearly differentiate between a video advert and an advertisement made for the tv video made for a tv can nev r replace video that is required for the internet and it will not make a good impression about the company in the eyes of the people since they can quickly make out that the ad has been copied directly from the tv if this happens then one is likely to l se out on viewers since people will not care to view the ad of the company ever again hence the company will loose viewers instead of gaining them and this will be a very big loss of opportunity

9003796 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9003797 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9003798 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9003799 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9003800 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9003801 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9003802 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9003803 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9003804 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9003805 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9003806 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9003807 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief

9003814 seg n ha anunciado el mismo puigcerc s la respuesta catalana debe ser insistir en su propuesta de finanaciaci n una iniciativa a la que sumar n una camapa a informativa para
9003815 qu perder n con el actual modelo de financiaci n
9003816 as the commission proceeds it is my hope that it gives all due consideration to all proposals concerning the best use of the white spaces including those proposals to license some or all of the available spectrum
9003817 it is possible that a licensing regime could help mitigate the impact of harmful interference to incumbents in this spectrum these particular bands of spectrum are extraordinarily valuable and offer the potential for entirely new and innovation services i urge the commission to carefully and deliberately weigh each proposal prior to reaching any tentative or preliminary conclusions
9003818 there is no evidence for the claim the tv white space would spur innovation in unlicensed applications
9003819 although unlicensed spectrum can provide a good home for low power short range systems and thus facilitate innovation in such systems the tv white space is overqualified for such applications devoting tv spectrum to low power short range systems is like using land in downtown tokyo to grow rice
9003820 there have been a significant number of experiments with unlicensed wi fi in major metropolitan areas including san francisco philadelphia and portland
9003821 in every instance these experiments have been a failure or were shot down before they started they have not failed due to a lack of funding
9003822 is a risk factor for long term leakage but not necessarily enough to require surgery
9003823 does not seem to give good long term results and this is probably due to poor compliance
9003824 we are concerned that a lot of the evidence for both before delivery and after delivery pelvic floor muscle training suggests poor long term effect
9003825 we believe that compliance is the major issue and this can only be improved by education
9003826 there are numerous benefits to weight loss by any means including a reduction in the severity of osa
9003827 however patients and their physicians should understand that osa can occur in the absence of obesity and losing weight even if substantial may not resolve osa
9003828 in fact the majority still had moderate to severe disease which would require continued treatment
9003829 is associated with numerous adverse effects on health and quality of life especially in those with moderate to severe disease if present it should be treated
9003830 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove cerumen from the ears
9003831 this can result in further impaction and other complications to the ear canal
9003832 these results provide further support for recommendations to limit consumption of trans fatty acids

9003840 to win here would be a huge deal for me
9003841 of course you want to win every race but you especially want that win in front of the home crowd and with your family and friends cheering you on
9003842 a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9003843 i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it
9003844 i think i would it is very much worth it i love the celebration of music and dance and art i just love it
9003845 theres a couple or really good ideas in here but i think it needs a few more drafts to develop a bit we would have whined and complained but actually would have been better for it
9003846 films are never finished or abandoned they just need a bit more work on the third reel
9003847 i was disappointed to see a great champion like him not make the top 10 in valencia during the european grand prix on august 24 where he retired on the first lap
9003848 he is motivated and we must work hard so that he is in a position to make a quick start
9003849 especially on the new circuits which i dont like and are doing harm to formula one
9003850 the operation had an extremely successful outcome when a clandestine print shop was raided while counterfeits of 200 and 500 euro denominations were being produced
9003851 in addition machinery and other equipment used to produce counterfeits were seized as well as smaller amounts of counterfeit us dollars and colombian pesos
9003852 management remains perfectly neutral with regard to all possible buyers and will make every effort to secure a deal with the partner who can offer the best long term perspective for the privatisation process
9003853 are not very good given conflictual relations with georgia and with the west
9003854 natixis is ready to write a new chapter in its history
9003855 we have suffered the consequences of this crisis which surprised natixis in the very first months of its existence
9003856 the kiss will be quite uncomfortable emmas like a sister to me so its going to be like really really weird
9003857 we can only have this many students because of lab stations
9003858 i think teams who have deficits should be kicked out of europe
9003859 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
9003860 uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled
9003861 it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons
9003862 every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
9003863 i buy the players i feel strengthen the squad after that i consider the price
9003864 i do the job i think it has to be done considering the resources of the club and considering our ambition and the players we have
9003865 i know the media and supporters sometimes too are happy with big numbers but for me what is most important is big quality sometimes both are linked but not always
9003866 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
9003867 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
9003868 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
9003869 we are out to look if we find the right players we will do it one or two
9003870 im gonna say that again cause the room always gets real quiet we a blues band
9003871 unbelievable i was blown away from beginning to end i could listen to you play for hours
9003872 you should be on stage with taj mahal at the long beach blues festival
9003873 dope hot and sexy id love to see you guys live again
9003874 get ready because next year maddens gonna be an all blues soundtrack
9003875 nothing speaks louder than aunt kizzyz boyz music in our eight years of existence rbc has never signed a group based on one listen until we heard akb and it only took two songs we are not alone in our opinion as everyone who hears the group falls in love immediately above and beyond their musical talents the guys are incredibly hard working and gig over 200 nights per year although blues is not the most commercially viable genre we believe that with the right talent and music we can traverse this stereotype and we know we have this
9003876 its important to take your songs and play them for kids around the neighborhood and at school where people dont know youre connected to the music and watch their reaction
9003877 if you know a dj in a club take it to him let him play it watch people on dance floor and see how it moves them see what they have to say
9003878 i believe that there is sales potential for all of you if you put out cds you should come to me and ill put them in my stores i have about 700 stores across the country im not saying youll go in all 700 but there is a spot for everyone so for all of you here i recommend that you get with me when your release comes out and ill take care of you in that manner
9003879 to climb his way out of the real problem he has with women
9003880 the battle in this election will be very much among independent swing voters
9003881 i thought it was a remarkable speech you know this is my first convention i didnt want to go to a convention until i was passionate about a candidate
9003882 he drew a line in the sand and said i will debate this that is so different from what weve been used to i am really proud
9003883 i thought it was absolutely fabulous he showed us the heart and soul inside of barack obama he showed he can be tough he showed hes a visionary
9003884 i cant imagine a woman thats been a governor for a year and a half but to debate joe biden on georgia a re emerging russia an emerging china and india on the middle east my god how does she do that
9003885 in the hastikakshya the mahamegha the nirvana the angulimalika and the lankavatara sutra i have reproved the eating of flesh by buddhas and by bodhisattvas and by religious persons it has been reprehended
9003886 as passion would be an obstacle to deliverance so would be such things as flesh or intoxicants in future time the eaters of flesh speakers of delusion will say that flesh is proper blameless praised by the buddhas but the pious should take his morsel in moderation against the grain like a useful physic as though it were the flesh of his own son i who abide in kindness have always reprehended this food
9003887 this is for the purpose of casting out the over pride of those who believe that purity is to be obtained by this renunciation this is also said to put aside the idea that those who are capable of entering salvation cannot enter because they are attached to that sort of meat
9003888 if this brother should die the very name of tranquility in jambudvipa would be ever destroyed for all creatures if he is cured he obtains tranquility

9003919 id love to keep the blog going but im fearful it may have gasped its last breath it was great for awhile but it became a chore
9003920 a lot of people have been in and out of this thing
9003921 everyone thinks they have something to say until theyre put onstage and asked to say it
9003922 im honestly no blog triumphalist but when did 100 million people involved in contributory media become a disappointment
9003923 theres something happening on myspace that is blog like but not exactly blogging
9003924 ive literally let several seasons go by hardly noticing because ive spent so much time indoors blogging
9003925 there was a time when this kind of homebound lifestyle would have horrified and depressed me but this past year i blithely blogged the weeks and months away as spring became fall and fall winter im not exercising im not eating right and im smoking so many cigarettes i have no idea how many packs im going through each day
9003926 during my initial blogging fervor i became a self professed blog pimp and comment whore
9003927 although im again very involved in blogging i am trying to balance it more with real life though i still find the internet to be hopelessly addictive
9003928 over the past couple of weeks ive grown less and less enthusiastic about keeping up this site

9003931 because you have failed to catch one of the few men in this town that are more than just a pretty face i now have a chance to be happy

9003937 there is no history only fictions of various degrees of plausibility
9003938 if i lie and say you took me for a friend patched together in my thin bones will you help me be cunning and noisy as the wind
9003939 the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive and unrealistic
9003940 i got no alibis cant even tell my usual lies
9003941 excellency its a natural lie to tell i beg you stop this now
9003942 i might come to the end of my life and find out everyone was lying

9003945 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
9003946 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function

9003950 the dollar is up and so were seeing prices of crude move down from the highs remember that in 2005 the market sold off hard before hurricane katrinas arrival and then rallied again when it hit
9003951 right now there is still uncertainty on where exactly gustav will hit and so it is difficult to determine the damage that the storm might bring
9003952 it may be four days before it actually hits the gulf coast and the forecasts show a wide area where it may hit so some people are positioning some are repositioning ahead of the long weekend
9003953 the conclusion is that the mere presence of ear wax does not require anything
9003954 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
9003955 inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
9003956 historically patient autonomy was something we really needed to pay attention to over the last 20 to 30 years this whole issue of medical technology and making sure patients have a say over their care but what were learning is that patients cannot make decisions in a vacuum because they really experience a series of relationships that affect who they are as a person and thats especially true when they have medical care my perception of this article is that it validates reality
9003957 its very reasonable for us to examine that family input is important and should be valued maybe ethical models are too narrow and maybe they should consider other factors as well

9003979 the theoretical realization that human activities could have a global discernible effect on the atmosphere came during the 19th century and the first conclusive measurements of atmospheric change were made during the last half of the 20th century
9003980 the first greenhouse gas demonstrated to be increasing in atmospheric concentration was carbon dioxide formed as a major end product in the extraction of energy from the burning of the fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas as well as in the burning of biomass

9004001 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
9004002 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me

9004041 the tsk tskers treat the web as if it is a media property and they judge it by its worst look what that nasty web is doing to our civilization but of course thats as silly as judging publishing by the worst of what is published its even more wrong because the internet is not media no matter how much media people insist on seeing the web in their image instead it is as doc searles points out a place where we talk
9004042 in an interconnected world media is everywhere its the stuff that plugs consumption and production together the opportunities for value creation are greater than ever before but we must expand our vision of what media is to begin realizing them
9004043 the public works tirelessly to flee to actual interactions between real people and our organisations work even more diligently and with more leverage to corporatize and anonymize the interactions the irony of course is that an organisation with guts can go in the opposite direction and win
9004044 advertising could be made much better if it tried to please its audience instead of treating them like victims who deserve x amount of abuse in return for whatever free site theyre getting the way to approach this problem is probably to start over from scratch to think what the goal of advertising is and ask how to do that using the new ingredients technology gives us

9004051 i would truthfully say that angola prison is a sophisticated plantation
9004052 cotton is king still applies when it come to angola
9004053 allows inmates to be trained in work habits and allows them to develop marketable skills in the areas of farming animal husbandry vegetable meat and milk processing
9004054 the warden says it takes good food good medicine good prayin and good playin to have a good prison
9004055 in the conventional plantations slaves were given just enough food clothing and shelter to be a financial asset to the owner the same is true for the louisiana prison system
9004056 prisoners worked out in the field sometimes 17 hours straight rain or shine
9004057 theyd tell you the officer was always right no matter what
9004058 prisoners can be forced to work for the government against their will and this is true in every state
9004059 i would have more faith in that amendment if it werent so clear that our criminal justice system is racially biased in a really obvious way
9004060 i dont have any illusions that this is a simple process
9004061 many people are apathetic about what happens in prisons it would be very difficult but i would not suggest it would be impossible
9004062 many black inmates viewed farm work under these circumstances as too close to slavery to want to participate
9004063 theyve got a lot of land to bury a lot of prisoners

9004076 im sitting there in the gold medal game with a straight face trying not to smile
9004077 spain are the guys we have to beat but im caught thats my player and i want to he claps his hands twice but i gotta he makes a serious face because we are going up against him
9004078 i was so impressed with him that it was to the point where after the second time i saw him i didnt sleep that night because i was moving my rotations around
9004079 i swear i did not sleep i could not sleep thinking about him because im saying we can put him here do this with him do that with him and brandon roy and do this so hes playing for us oh yeah i see that right now
9004080 every time rudy did something dantoni would look at me and say your player huh
9004081 and i would be yeah hes cool like no big deal
9004082 then he does something else and dantoni would be like dang pretty good huh
9004083 hes okay still has to work on going to his left
9004084 then all of a sudden he catches a lob then he steals it and is swinging on the rim and its like dang over there you talk about the u s basketball team and rudy is the next thing you talk about it was team usa rudy and he played to earn that
9004085 i feel like i can coach him and i feel i can help him become better and i feel he can help us
9004086 but how does he fit in thats going to be the whole thing with our guys this year there are going to be different roles he was the man in spain where he touched the ball every possession and the offense ran through him that changes a bit here we are still going to have to run some stuff for you but you are probably not going to get as many touches as you did in spain

9004112 but after watching a lot of nba basketball and the playoffs coach k felt this is the way we should play it
9004113 something coach k really works on and something i really took from him was his words and what he says to his team when he first speaks to them
9004114 he really works on what he is going to say when his team sits in front of him
9004115 the one thing he did that put a big smile on my face is he asked coach monty williams to come in at night and work with him
9004116 so he was doing two a days working with dean demopoulos in the morning and monty at night and he did it himself he would come back at night and work on his footwork with monty and for me thats good thats great he is on schedule where jay jensen and the trainers want him to be

9004144 were both fathers we like this central family that moves into beverly hills and its a question of how do they hold onto their moral center
9004145 we think this generation of parenting is different than the ones we grew up with we as parents did almost everything that our kids are doing our parents didnt do that its a lot harder to lie to us we know what theyre doing and they cant get away with stuff that they think they are because we did it 20 years ago
9004146 the network and the studio theyre very concerned about every little part of this
9004147 its such a big business now were not in a world where they go hey creative guys heres a bunch of money go shoot something theres so much relying on the success of this show

9004157 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference
9004158 the question is how can i best do that is it using the seniority i have in the senate or is it in getting out there and running for governor
9004159 i have run statewide four times now i have a base its up and down the state
9004160 the state is so big i think candidates misjudge california they think they can get in a bus and go around and see enough people you cant you need to be known you need to raise the money you need to have a combination of campaign organization support and programs
9004161 this isnt 2010 i dont need to build an organization to run i dont need to do an exploratory committee to run that is all out there if i want to do it therefore at the appropriate time i will make a decision

9004184 noi aggiunge lex ministro abbiamo definito questo complesso capitolo che riguarda le pensioni del sistema contributivo definendo tra laltro una nuova cadenza temporale per la revisione dei coefficienti dai precedenti 10 anni agli attuali 3 anni la prima revisione stabilita prevista con effetto dal primo gennaio del 2010
9004185 lesecutivo nomini una commissione di esperti del governo e delle parti sociali entro la fine di questanno per approfondire questa tematica come prevede il protocollo

9004203 dies ist ein guter auftakt f r mich und das team
9004204 ich mag diese strecke heute morgen waren die asphalttemperaturen hoch aber wir fanden f r diese bedingungen nicht die besten einstellungen am nachmittag stellten wir am motor an den bremsen und an der traktionskontrolle einiges um und dadurch funktionierte das gesamtpaket besser von da an f hlte ich mich wohler und ich konnte so fahren wie es mir behagt
9004205 vielleicht h tte ich meine rundenzeit schon heute sogar noch verbessern k nnen aber ich bin eigentlich zufrieden und hoffe dass es so weitergeht
9004206 es ist eigentlich eine recht interessante strecke sie ist gar nicht so leicht wir haben auf alle f lle noch ein bisschen was zu tun
9004207 sehr rutschig eine sehr schmale linie und auf der muss man auch halbwegs drauf bleiben was mit einem so gro en auto gar nicht so leicht ist
9004208 hier ist die erste kurve ja sehr speziell die man nicht einsehen kann und mit einem dtm auto ist es noch schwieriger
9004209 die strecke bietet auf der ideallinie recht viel grip aber daneben auch sehr wenig darauf muss man sich einfach st ck f r st ck einschie en und jede runde n her ans limit gehen und wie man gesehen hat manchmal auch dr ber hinaus
9004210 ich h tte es wahrscheinlich noch geschafft aber dann w re das risiko zu gro gewesen dass ich eingeschlagen w re deshalb bin ich auf der bremse geblieben und habe den kies vorgezogen
9004211 ich wollte die strecke nicht so dreckig machen wie die anderen ich bin viel zu nett lacht anm d red aber nein spa beiseite ich bin langsam gefahren weil es ja nichts bringen w rde die ganze strecke dreckig zu machen
9004212 eigentlich h tte wegschmei en k nnen aber da ich die strecke nicht kenne ist halt jede runde wichtig
9004213 die strecke hat ja auch zwei relativ schnelle kurve die erste und die vierte mit ihren paar kurven hat sie trotzdem von allem etwas sie ist sogar ein bisschen uneben und man muss ber kerbs fahren k nnen es ist also nicht so ohne die abstimmung ist nicht leicht aber das ist sie am norisring auch nicht obwohl nur vier kurven da sind eigenartigerweise
9004214 dass wir ber nacht noch die strecke ein bisschen besser lernen so im traum lacht anm d red und dann werden wir mal schauen was dabei rauskommt
9004215 dies war ein guter tag w hrend dem wir uns darum gek mmert haben eine feinabstimmung f r das auto auf dieser strecke zu finden
9004216 zudem haben wir ein paar neue dinge ausprobiert ich w rde sagen dass wir gute arbeit geleistet haben auch wenn es noch zu fr h ist um zu sagen wie hier die situation w hrend des rennwochenendes aussehen wird
9004217 es war mir ein vergn gen pr sident montezemolo zu treffen der die strecke heute besucht hat
9004218 nun m ssen wir versuchen alles m gliche zu tun um wieder mit dem siegen zu beginnen beginnend mit dem rennen in spa die weltmeisterschaft ich werde mein bestes geben und dann k nnen wir am ende die punkte z hlen
9004219 wir haben mehr f r das rennen gearbeitet und ich denke es sieht nicht so schlecht aus die grundbalance vom auto ist nicht so schlecht wir m ssen noch etwas f r das rennen arbeiten aber der grund ist nicht so schlecht
9004220 wir m ssen im detail analysieren was das problem war
9004221 bis zu dem unfall verlief der test gut aber wir hatten um den mittag herum ein paar probleme am nachmittag waren die strecken bedingungen dann wohl etwas langsamer und wir konnten nicht wirklich gute fortschritte erzielen
9004222 der unfall war nicht sch n und ich bin mir nicht sicher was passiert ist wir hatten etwas untersteuern und es war nicht besonders komfortabel ber den randstein zu fahren ich war mir jedoch nicht bewusst einen fehler gemacht zu haben wir m ssen uns die daten genau anschauen
9004223 es war pech dass timo kurz vor ende von der strecke abkam aber wenn es schon passiert dann ist es dann besser als zu beginn des tages
9004224 wir hatten uns schon durch den gro teil unseres plans gearbeitet der darauf abzielte timo mit den spezifischen anforderungen von monza vertraut zu machen die im vergleich zu anderen strecken ziemlich anders sind
9004225 wir experimentierten viel mit dem gef hl f r die bremse mit der bodenfreiheit und mit dem generellen aerodynamik setup es waren drei produktive tage mit konstanten bedingungen und ohne verz gerungen durch das wetter
9004226 ich m chte mich bei allen f r ihre anstrengungen bedanken wir haben eine menge daten gesammelt und werden diese nun alle vor dem gro en preis von italien hier kommenden monat ber cksichtigen
9004227 the ret ptc rearrangements were more common among cancers from individuals with higher radiation exposure doses cancers that occurred earlier after the a bomb exposure and cancers among those who were at younger ages at a bomb exposure
9004228 needs to be confirmed with additional ptc patients in the future
9004229 the fact that radiation exposure is associated with thyroid cancer is well known and not news
9004230 but now as research technology has caught up with scientific expectations theyre now able to identify the specific that causes the cancer and indeed this is exactly what you would expect

9004233 after 10 years of studying the effects of magnesium sulfate it has proven to be a successful method of reducing the outcome of cerebral palsy in premature births
9004234 based on results of the study in the future it is possible that women at risk of prematurely giving birth could proactively receive magnesium sulfate to reduce their childs chances of developing cerebral palsy
9004235 with additional research it is possible that in the next few years this will be a standard of care

9004249 ich dachte dass eine einsame ostseeinsel mit einem leuchtturm wunderbar f r ein wetterstudio w re als wir dann er ffneten habe ich schmerzhaft erfahren dass die insel nicht sehr einsam ist aber sie ist dennoch eine der sch nsten inseln der welt
9004250 an und abreise kommen nun nicht mehr einer expedition gleich
9004251 an einem der sch nsten flecken dieser welt arbeiten zu d rfen und es k nnen wenn es nach mir geht noch 100 jahre werden
9004252 dies alles zeigt dass der ndr der wettersender in mecklenburg vorpommern ist
9004253 wir setzen dabei auf die ausgewiesene kompetenz des ndr wetterstudios auf hiddensee wetter aus mecklenburg vorpommern f r mecklenburg vorpommern
9004254 it kicks into the air with its legs then the wings take over
9004255 we got leads the public was calling in leads and we followed up on each and every one of those
9004256 it looked very good and promising but there were literally probably more than a double digit number of suspects we brought in
9004257 if you go look for a blue civic youre going to find a lot of them
9004258 this is great news and the detectives did an excellent job
9004259 but the real credit must go to the actual victim because she gave an excellent description of not only the suspect but the suspects vehicle which was critical
9004260 when something like this happens it really strikes at the whole community and were happy to have this individual behind bars
9004261 what hes facing is a life sentence short of murder this is it this is the top of the food chain for crimes
9004262 if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
9004263 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
9004264 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
9004265 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association we heard from ambassador churkin
9004266 there is no territorial ambition or desire to dismember iraq
9004267 it is a source of profound disappointment to us to witness the council rendered incapable of discharging its responsibility to maintain international peace and security
9004268 i am urging the workers and contractors with the support of the airlines to come to a fair agreement that ensures quality services and keeps passengers moving safely and efficiently at the international gateway to southern california
9004269 were hopeful that the contractors will come to the table with a new commitment for workers rights and improved quality services
9004270 but this is the veep slot not the presidential slot
9004271 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
9004272 i know my stance might keep me from la jobs since almost the whole town is liberal but some time in a mans life or a bleach blonde 49 year old womans life one must stand for what they believe in and put truth before popularity
9004273 back then even if you were blacklisted you could still make money
9004274 if network television rejected you broadway would still welcome you with open arms now if youre some low level guy walking around the paramount lot trying to get noticed and your right of center politics become know its a disaster the same industry people that walked out of good night and good luck crying their eyes out wont give you the time of day because they think bush is hitler and therefore youre an ss soldier
9004275 hollywood is a very liberal town and supporting a republican even one with liberal social views is considered risky business
9004276 theres always pollution all the time you live with it every day well see how things turn out
9004277 i didnt take it very seriously at first and thought it was a little bit of a joke but now im wondering if i should be worried im not exactly panicking but im going to pay more attention now
9004278 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war thats not the judgement we need that wont keep americans safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
9004279 senza il consenso dei sindacati non ci sar il decollo del piano fenice e della nuova compagnia
9004280 le prossime quattro settimane sono cruciali e si capir se si va avanti o no
9004281 does not provide a helpful guidepost for determining the scope
9004282 addressed the requirements of a unique regulatory and statutory scheme that is not at issue here
9004283 for the first time since the crimean war russia has no allies
9004284 we are encircled by countries that are either suspicious or alienated and very angry
9004285 unless they are russia dedicated they will move to friendlier environments sentiment is just very bad
9004286 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
9004287 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia
9004288 if there is a perception of russia as a risky place or as an undesirable place to invest then the damage will be more long term
9004289 it will restrict the development of the economy and hurt the governments plans to create a more diversified the economy
9004290 it is big aggressive undemocratic and irresponsible georgia who took small and innocent south ossetia
9004291 are sad about the situation and i have had many e mails from people asking why the media is reporting the situation only from one side
9004292 this is a strategic and long term mistake the effects of which will be felt by virtually all russians
9004293 democratic values and cooperation with the west will be seen as a betrayal
9004294 but its going to turn up a couple of notches its not a trend reversal
9004295 there are a lot of comments from players going about that i dont think should have been said to be honest
9004296 i dont need to get in the discussion of montys discussions hes got enough work to do this week to try to make the side himself he should just be getting his head down and trying to play good golf
9004297 nice to be told what to do by one so young and so inexperienced
9004298 is anyone else speaking to nick no self praise is no praise
9004299 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9004300 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9004301 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9004302 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9004303 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9004304 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9004305 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9004306 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9004307 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9004308 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9004309 if youre teaching the material it doesnt matter if the test is changed or not
9004310 by the time they get to high school they are tested out
9004311 no one is polling graduates to see how theyre doing
9004312 how can we say were creating lifelong learners if we dont know
9004313 dancing with blood on their sneakers to bonnie and clyde
9004314 en el instante presente est n el pasado y el futuro el futuro es inventable no inevitable y se construye con lo que hacemos hoy
9004315 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9004316 shes exactly what this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and the country second
9004317 i know that when sen mccain gave me this opportunity he had a list of highly qualified men and women and to have made that list at all it was a privilege and to have been chosen brings a great challenge
9004318 i know that it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9004319 these new technologies are changing the way we produce digital cinema
9004320 producers and dps can communicate the intended look of a shot to their postproduction vendors while maintaining the raw image data for post and finishing
9004321 the speedgrade approach gives me reference looks directly from the dp
9004322 since the color is non destructive and therefore editable i can begin grading at any time even while production is still going on the original frames remain unaltered and speedgrade saves my grading as metadata to continue working on later
9004323 we are demonstrating the key benefits of digital cinema at ibc
9004324 instant access to your content the ability to save additional information such as color instructions as metadata and the fact that the whole pipeline is now connected
9004325 solo 2 0 improves functionality with no increase in complexity
9004326 compared to the earlier version our more powerful software lowers the price of each output stream we are pleased that we have been able to incorporate the functionality requested by the archiving community of simplifying the migration process thereby increasing cost effectiveness in the preservation of videotape archiving and migration
9004327 we expect this upgrade to serve not only the needs of archivists but also the needs of broadcast educational and corporate videotape library owners who want to get broader use from their tapes internal uses internet transmission dvd creation and other purposes
9004328 ive worked with a lot of music libraries for films and smartsound is unique because it gives us the ability to adjust the music to fit the scene with great detail and precision using high quality well produced music
9004329 the ultimate compliment was when rob reiner told me on the dub stage that one of the smartsound cues worked better than the pricey source cue we had in the temp
9004330 were seeing a lot more film editors embrace the smartsound solution
9004331 our outstanding music quality coupled with our innovative customization features for editors and filmmakers has resulted in new creative options that redefine the role library music can play in a film
9004332 ive seen smartsound ads in the trade magazines but i hadnt researched it until a client asked about it experiencing the smartsound solution firsthand will do more for a professional editor than any recommendation or advertisement could do
9004333 javier has the ability to reference any specific detail about any sci fi movie or television show his love of all things sci fi and comic related helped to guide us in driving the art
9004334 this series was one of the most challenging ive ever worked on from a time perspective
9004335 production started late due to the writers strike causing everything on the back end to become compressed
9004336 made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
9004337 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9004338 now the citys officials have an official place to work and focus on the public
9004339 its because i am in a leadership role and i will not subject my privates to undue influence
9004340 but if everybody in the platoon is voting for obama anyway and you are voting for obama then how can you exert undue influence
9004341 random acts of violence in public places are the only plan these savages have for the future of iraq
9004342 to make sure we have justice we are trying to build a country built on the constitution and all of these efforts by our expert investigators will help the police to establish the truth and uphold the rule of law
9004343 always use the selected program to open this kind of file
9004344 thanks to a tip off from a friend of a friend of a friend it came to our attention yesterday that r eality tvs most terrible twosome might be opening a bar in our hometown
9004345 they move their legs around to reposition their bodies so that when they do jump they will push themselves away from the looming threat
9004346 you should anticipate that theyre going to jump away from you so you should extend your swat in the direction of the flys anticipated motion
9004347 when you see a fly flitting around your hair or your potato salad you might see an annoyance
9004348 but in my lab you really see a marvelous machine arguably the most sophisticated flying device on the planet
9004349 it is certainly my hope this matter is addressed very quickly
9004350 mr peters has been thinking carefully about this its been clear to me that this was the appropriate course of action but there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about this at all it is accepted that this is totally proper and there are precedents for it
9004351 the artisan series basically gives users everything but the kitchen sink in terms of features and performance
9004352 more importantly these benefits enable users to express their creative side in ways never before imagined at epson weve built our reputation on giving our customers the industrys best image quality and this flagship line is a key milestone in that tradition
9004353 were going to judge this on the basis of whether there are employment guarantees and guarantees for the places of work
9004354 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9004355 he said make sure you listen to the news from hunting camp i should have put two and two together
9004356 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9004357 can you be a bit more specific about that third step
9004358 immediately transferred to the state general fund by the attorney generals office
9004359 i dont think its progress because it is strictly a reporting requirement after the fact
9004360 i mean i guess its better than nothing but it does show how scared the legislative leadership is of attorney general darrell mcgraw that they only require him to tell them after he settles
9004361 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
9004362 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
9004363 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
9004364 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
9004365 theres a lot of people who arent going to vote for him
9004366 for me i thought it was a lot more specific and a lot more about whats on the minds of latino voters
9004367 i think you could see the specificity and the emotional import that he gave to the issue of immigration
9004368 barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies
9004369 he would have preferred the provision regarding immunity not be included in there
9004370 as bills work their way through congress senators and representatives have to make decisions about the worth of a bill it was the right thing to do at that time even though he didnt agree with that provision
9004371 stronger judicial review of national security letters and shorter time limits on sneak and peak searches among other things
9004372 anything he endorses in the future is going to have that balance between ensuring our national security and ensuring civil liberties and privacy rights and u s person rights
9004373 he believes torture not be allowed in any form or fashion in any part of the federal government and he would make sure that was the case
9004374 whether the army field manual is comprehensive enough to cover all those tactics and techniques thats something i think hed look to his national security advisers for
9004375 restore the balance weve lost between the necessarily secret and the necessity of openness in a democratic society
9004376 we should institutionalize the practice of developing competitive assessments of critical threats and strengthen our methodologies of analysis
9004377 we need technologies and practices that enable us to efficiently collect and share information within and across our intelligence agencies
9004378 a modern day oss could draw together specialists in unconventional warfare civil affairs and psychological warfare covert action operators and experts in anthropology advertising and other relevant disciplines from inside and outside government
9004379 like the original oss this would be a small nimble can do organization it would fight terrorist subversion around the world and in cyberspace
9004380 in todays economic environment people with less education may have to work longer hours in order to make ends meet which severely impacts work life balance
9004381 with canadas median annual income at less than 25 000 the reality is that many canadians need to work more in jobs with little opportunity for advancement just to keep up
9004382 we are not the first to make dna tubes with controlled circumferences however compared with previous approaches our method is distinctively simple and modular
9004383 the simplicity of the single stranded tile approach promises to enable us to design ever more complex self assembling molecular systems the work is simultaneously elegant and useful
9004384 organelle targeted nanocarriers specific delivery of liposomal ceramide to mitochondria enhances its cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo
9004385 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
9004386 a quantitative study on the photothermal effect of immuno gold nanocages targeted to breast cancer cells
9004387 si mi iphone hubiera llevado a una chica tan mona estar a dispuesto a pagar extra especialmente si inclu a su direcci n de correo

9004390 who will be the republican presidential nominee in 2012 depending on future circumstances i may resurrect it
9004391 having your picture on the wheaties box is is a mark of distinction that says youve reached the pinnacle of your career

9004400 this amendment is abut dealing with the state legislatures and the laws that theyve imposed on us and if we dont deal with it there are political consequences as well as economic consequences for all the state parties

9004407 se avaliarmos a cidadezinha medieval mais comum ou a p lis grega habitual a maior parte delas mais ou menos do tamanho do que encontramos na amaz nia apenas que estas ltimas s o muito mais complexas do ponto de vista do planejamento
9004408 the more listings there are on the market the bigger the impact on the average price
9004409 it means a market when buyers have more options and sellers must be realistic in their pricing expectations
9004410 the continuing rise in the number of new listings is resulting in a considerably more balanced resale housing market this year than buyers faced last year
9004411 this trend is most apparent in british columbia and saskatchewan which remained the most balanced provincial markets in july
9004412 in order to promote this dignity in an integral way so called christianophobia should be combated as decisively as islamophobia and anti semitism

9004422 these people some now possibly parents themselves may be in a better position to come forward with information
9004423 overheidsbedrijven zoals belgacom zouden beter geprivatiseerd worden de rol van de overheid is in de eerste plaats de voorwaarden cre ren voor een competitieve goedwerkende markt het is niet aan de overheid om zelf een marktspeler te zijn met in dit geval een quasi monopoliepositie er bovenop
9004424 de overheid moet zorgen dat de consument profiteert van scherpe concurrentie dit is vandaag nog altijd niet het geval belgacom schermt de markt af

9004430 when we were going to our jobs we did not know whether we would get back home or not
9004431 everyday we felt the same fear and horror and now even though its better we dont know when this horror will return
9004432 near our house there was a place we used to call the execution zone
9004433 i myself saw a cameraman with the militants in every action
9004434 they brought kidnapped men blindfolded with their hands tied lined them up on the street and shot them one by one
9004435 my wife has been sick ever since she saw these killings from our house
9004436 the militants might ask anyone on the street about his identity
9004437 they take him to their stronghold for questioning when they find he is their sect they release him if not they kill him
9004438 militants attacked me in the market they forced me into the boot of a car after reaching their place they got me out of the boot tied my hands and covered my eyes they poisoned me with something that made me sick along with several other people in a room
9004439 they were shouting and insulting us they whipped me with a cable and a nylon tube on my back and legs after a few hours they took me to another room there i met the leader they called him the prince he asked me about my sect tribe job relatives etc the prince decided to release me after three days

9004452 holt has been a model of consistency yielding good reason for his meteoric rise up draft boards this past spring he is third in the ny p in era and he probably wouldnt even need to make another start in order to finish as the leader in strikeouts better yet holt is using his breaking ball and his changeup more often and judging by the results he is getting comfortable using his secondary stuff

9004457 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference
9004458 the question is how can i best do that is it using the seniority i have in the senate or is it in getting out there and running for governor
9004459 in peony in love the opera the peony pavilion by tang xianzu the three wives commentary on the peony pavilion 1 and the theme of love all play important roles
9004460 i wanted to explore different aspects of love gratitude love pity love respectful love romantic love sexual love sacrificing love duty love and finally mother love
9004461 then i came across the three wives commentary the first book of its kind to have been published anywhere in the world to have been written by women three wives no less with that my interest turned into an obsession
9004462 the front door and windows blew entirely out and there was flames coming out of the windows

9005055 open in window before you can get the code to post to your blog or website
9005056 if you are looking for young heroes and role models forget the highly paid athletes who leave their consciences at passport control
9005057 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests who are being tortured and held in labour camps just a few miles from the glittering birds nest stadium
9005058 mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team
9005059 we should be giving our young athletes all the resources and support possible not rubbishing and going out of our way to put them down
9005060 these athletes are not wealthy premiership footballers but committed and talented sportsmen who often fit their training around a full time job
9005061 there are of course concerns over chinas human rights record but the way to combat this is not by denigrating our athletes
9005062 it is offensive to suggest so when these fine young men and women are not only doing britain proud but are helping to open china to the world and the world to china
9005063 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9005064 went so far as to attack the presumed strength of mr mccains campaign national security
9005065 was less lofty than his earlier rhetorical forays more specific on the policies he would pursue as president and more scathing towards mccain
9005066 presented some long standing and fairly conventional democratic economic proposals
9005067 cheering went on for several minutes the stadium erupted with hundreds of camera flashes and shuddered from the concussion of thousands of stamping feet
9005068 with a display of fireworks and pageantry worthy of an olympic opening
9005069 misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama
9005070 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidates for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9005071 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
9005072 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9005073 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
9005074 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
9005075 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
9005076 made clear we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
9005077 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives

9005090 the white house is energized and excited by this choice
9005091 he said that the mccain palin ticket is very strong he wished her good luck told her that she will be a fantastic vice presidential candidate and that he is looking forward to a great victory in november
9005092 she opposed the listing of polar bears as a threatened species she supports the brutal aerial hunting of wolves and she has been a friend of big oil opposing a windfall profits tax on the oil industry that could fund affordable clean energy for more americans

9005103 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
9005104 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia

9005288 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9005289 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
9005290 gue akan undang 666 anak yatim amp anak jalanan dan akan melepaskan balon 666 buah berisi uang rp 5 000 s d rp 100 000 jumlah total uang tersebut rp 66jt
9005291 apakah kamu juga tidak dapat memahaminya tidak tahukah kamu bahwa segala sesuatu dari luar yang masuk ke dalam seseorang tidak dapat menajiskannya 7 17 sesudah ia masuk ke sebuah rumah untuk menyingkir dari orang banyak murid murid nya bertanya kepada nya tentang arti perumpamaan itu 7 16 barangsiapa bertelinga untuk mendengar hendaklah ia mendengar 7 15 apapun dari luar yang masuk ke dalam seseorang tidak dapat menajiskannya tetapi apa yang keluar dari seseorang itulah yang menajiskannya
9005292 were looking at potential p3 public private partnership proposals to see if theres any interest in moving forward with the mackenzie valley highway
9005293 weve got to form partnerships with industry with ourselves and with the federal government
9005294 the more we sit and talk the more we let other governments decide for us
9005295 its easy enough to become frustrated with the slow pace of discussions and commitments talk of a federal election only adds to that because during elections talks stop
9005296 but that shouldnt stop us in the north from at least doing our part
9005297 i think it warrants exploration access in the north is important the highway is important and its something that well have discussions with the premier about
9005298 03 honda ex honda low miles cup holders 2900 santa clara
9005299 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9005300 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on
9005301 me detuve despu s de viajar mucho y ya no quer a hacer m sica de nuevo yo estaba muy feliz de dejar todo atr s estaba muy feliz con todo lo ya que hab a logrado
9005302 ahora con el xito que ha tenido paper planes hay mucho de mi todav a como para hacer otro disco incluso ahora mi mam cree mas en mi y eso es un estimulo pero yo planeaba una vida como una mujer dedicada a la pesca a las afueras de camboya esto ultimo es una broma
9005303 while darwin predicted that the fossil record would show numerous transitional fossils even 140 years later all we have are a handful of disputable examples
9005304 mutations have been observed to destroy delete or corrupt genetic information or to be neutral but have not been observed to add information this is true even of beneficial mutations like shrivelled eyed cave fish or flightless beetles on windswept islands where the changes still involve loss of sight or flight however particles to people evolution requires so many information increasing mutations that it should be easy to find such mutations happening today and we have yet to observe even one
9005305 there is some kind of engagement to have some understanding of where we are because its not clear whether the talks have collapsed or are still on
9005306 the mediator has to help us appreciate where we are in terms of locating a way forward
9005307 we are trying with mbeki to get zanu pf to be flexible because there has not been any indication of movement of flexibility on the part of zanu pf
9005308 just with the south african mediators there is no zanu pf
9005309 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political and outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
9005310 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humanitarian crisis
9005311 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground
9005312 to tell a business owner that they cant express their beliefs on an issue is a really stupid thing
9005313 the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
9005314 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
9005315 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
9005316 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9005317 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9005318 we cannot walk alone the preacher cried and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
9005319 like the music they play in the background in a big movie just after a big battle when everyones absorbing what happened
9005320 america did not see the real barack obama last night
9005321 the man who misled the public for four years about his vote to let a chicago area hospital continue leaving premature abortion survivors to die and who promised that his first act as president will be to re legalize partial birth abortion offered this calm plea to the nation we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
9005322 i have the knowledge the background and the judgment to lead this nation my opponent vice presidential pick does not i admire and respect senator obama governor palin for a young wo man with very little experience s hes done very well for his her very very great lack of experience and knowledge of the issues s hes been very successful
9005323 in other words allowing everyone not just web developers to remix the web so it fits their needs no matter what page they are on or what they are doing
9005324 amounts to suing someone for attempted distribution something the copyright act has never recognized
9005325 weve come in as underdogs and have hit our straps in every single department
9005326 the blokes have done an amazing job nut we want to improve and we want to try to win it 5 0 if we can
9005327 its nice to be able to click your fingers and have fast bowlers running in at 90mph theyve done an amazing job over the last two weeks
9005328 and the fielding over the last couple of weeks has been second to none
9005329 theres such a fine line between scoring runs and not doing but ive worked with phil watching the ball onto the bat and its nice when you score a few
9005330 its more about timing and stroking the ball and stats suggest i score better batting at five getting in when the seamers are still on and accelerating at the death
9005331 i dont think ive bowled particularly well in the three one dayers but jimmy anderson and stuart broad bowled very well today
9005332 were not playing good cricket at the moment but i think england are playing unbelievable cricket and are outplaying us in every department
9005333 weve lost a few key players but we probably lost the game in the first 10 to 15 overs today as chasing 300 was always going to be an uphill battle
9005334 we arent firing on all cylinders we came here to win the test cricket but we pride ourselves on our performances and we dont want people to forget what weve achieved here
9005335 gee if i just took a dart train i wouldnt be stuck behind this big truck advertising dart right now
9005336 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
9005337 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
9005338 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
9005339 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
9005340 pelo que ouvi falar a respeito do seu filme com certeza irei gostar muito

9005382 adolph was going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a 22 250 rifle which had been sighted at 750 yards
9005383 johnson was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama and he responded in the affirmative
9005384 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9005385 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match governor palin has spent her time in office shaking up government in alaska and actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9005386 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives

9005410 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9005411 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9005412 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9005413 this may have stifled efforts at developing newer and better vaccines especially for use in the elderly
9005414 improving quality of care are better directed at where the evidence is such as hand washing vaccinating children and vaccinating health care workers
9005415 ladies and gentlmen in my estimation i think were ready for this threat
9005416 i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so
9005417 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level
9005418 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
9005419 this plan has been very highly regarded for a very long time
9005420 we see this as something that gives us an addition to our product lines and it gives the folks at florida health care plan the opportunity to access our larger networks
9005421 they havent given me any guarantee that this will not happen again
9005422 i have a contract with real madrid now but we are still negotiating with chelsea
9005423 a lot of things are being published and they are not the truth

9005429 i tried to play with some toy applications and enjoyed it
9005430 it was very pleasing to see the boys get another victory and it was a good display although we were a bit erratic at times
9005431 ross perry and jamie ness in particular were excellent on the day as was archie who took his goals really well
9005432 that will do his confidence a lot of good and hopefully he can push on now and enjoy a good season
9005433 but overall i thought it was a decent game between two sides who like to get the ball down and its always nice to travel back from aberdeen with three points in the bag
9005434 we had a few players out today such as danny wilson stephen stirling rhys mccabe and kane hemmings but the lads that came in did very well
9005435 you fucking gun toting bible clinging racist hicks are too goddamn stupid to understand the brilliance of barak obama

9005449 this is an exciting day and for alaska you know i hope we register on somebodys radar screen
9005450 we have so much oil we are just sitting on

9005454 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs

9005459 one of the problems mccain would have if he picked romney was
9005460 during the 2001 recession brand marketers that cut budgets significantly lost market share a trend they do not want to repeat in 2008 the overall market will exhibit only minor declines as brand marketers shift budgets to alternative media that are targeted at hard to reach demographics like the youth and business markets
9005461 its a very significant ruling at the very least multinational mining companies now know they cant evade responsibility when the military personnel they hire commit murder and torture

9005482 her family owned the ranch her dad bought it i knew helen older sister and peggy the last remaining sister they visited the ranch regularly as children and young adults it was their summer place sometime in sixties the sisters moved fulltime to the ranch i was active in the browns valley area helen got involved with the neighborhood association her sister peggy was supportive of things we were working on sent a small donation along with me they were among the original signers of measure j when i got to know peggy connolly i enjoyed listening to her as she spoke of how much pleasure she got from watching children feed her animals she told me she would like to see children continue to learn about farm life and left her property to the land trust telling me do what is right she died a few months later
9005483 a sweet little dog named miss mitzie who ruled the roost the fantastic library and wonderful old furniture and lots of potlucks sitting under the oak tree
9005484 when i was in college i spent time up at the ranch taking a semester off from cal peggy and helen were very special and unusual people you knew that after knowing them for five minutes i remember them as being unusually intelligent women something i was always looking for always a step or two ahead peggy looked like an irish colleen with a lovely smile
9005485 i always thought of it as the chisholm trail going up to the house they wore pants and sweaters and housedresses and if it was a hot day they offered iced tea or iced coffee then they broke out highballs on the porch they had donkeys and cats they were very very opinionated and had wonderful senses of humor they would be so happy to know that someone appreciated them
9005486 peggy and helen our bogus aunts as they often called themselves probably left many friends and admirers but likely no real enemies and precious few of any of them are still alive peggy and helen were in some ways larger than life figures they were smart maybe brilliant they were plain spoken no nonsense women who could and did take on anyone who crossed them with their brother and father and those who worked for them occasionally at the ranch i recall them as caring and compassionate with just about everyone else us included they were a bit rough and tumble none too careful about their language yet always ready for a good laugh and always good hearted with a strong sense of fairness

9005492 its sort of like asking me if theres a better person than myself to deliver the message i tried to deliver and i say sure theres probably plenty
9005493 the people who are most committed to him tend to be principally small government traditional republicans who may well sit this election out because john mccain does not support their positions
9005494 its also the so called affirmative action programs that the government passes to say well you must make loans to certain people that want to buy houses
9005495 we need less regulation by the government but more regulation by the market

9005500 the president today declared an emergency exists in the state of louisiana and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from gustav beginning on august 27 2008 and continuing
9005501 ive been in search for the right words and the closest thing that i can come up with is surreal
9005502 i had not seen him convey that kind of commitment he seemed to be operating from a place of strength
9005503 back then you would be viewed differently if you showed anger
9005504 you could be angry but you had to show that you were not dangerous especially if you were a black man
9005505 for a black person to say back then that im going to run for president would be like someone saying im going to walk to mars
9005506 i knew then that this was going to be something

9005509 king is the son of the segregated south obama is the son of integrated hawaii
9005510 king is a preacher and obama is a law professor no one would think of comparing the two if they werent both black
9005511 they both faced the task of introducing themselves to a potentially skeptical audience
9005512 after starting as just one therapist massaging in one room so many years ago it is time for the business name to recognize the hard work of everybody involved with our seven day a week operation
9005513 my intention is to maintain the small town feel of an owner operated business while embracing the new growth of downtown napa
9005514 even with amanda in florida some of the time this place is still very much owner operated
9005515 shes actually more like an octopus since she does top notch massage skin and nails plus contributes on the admin side
9005516 it is such a privilege to work with these people if im not the perfect massage therapist for you then i know somebody else here will be we want you to find the perfect fit
9005517 were actually more like a family than regular co workers
9005518 since were open everyday early till late we work together to create a schedule that supports our busy clients as well as our own home lives
9005519 we recently created a discount for pregnant women after working with my sisters co workers and now my wife during pregnancy i know first hand that there is no better time to receive a massage
9005520 our goal is to remain the locals favorite with the ideal visitors location
9005521 while helping others and having fun this event will be our second chance to make a first impression as the place for massage amp bodycare in napa
9005522 weve been doing things differently here for a long time now we put a name on it
9005523 a s for that v p talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that v p slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question

9005556 regarding prostate cancer the trend was less and not statistically significant
9005557 there are basically two approaches to negotiation the adversarial and the interest based
9005558 you can still negotiate aggressively on your interests you just dont want to be a jerk
9005559 real estate is a classic example of the objective standard you can calculate replacement cost and market value you can create a formula for value outside the transactions
9005560 people make an objective decision after they satisfy their emotional needs
9005561 really listen to what the other person is saying and repeat back what youve heard to validate their opinions
9005562 youve made the emotional deposit by listening so now theyre willing to let you make the withdrawal
9005563 you have to try to put yourself in the other persons shoes and understand his or her view of the issue often a conflict is not about facts but about how those facts are perceived
9005564 she didnt work downtown so she thought only about the noise from the train i commuted every day so i thought being able to walk to the train was a big plus
9005565 people behave based upon their backgrounds and experience knowing the past is a good predictor of the future
9005566 you need to understand whats of long term importance to all parties so that theyll be satisfied with the transaction
9005567 ask questions like are your clients in a hurry to buy or how long has your client been looking or even what is it about the property that appeals to your client youll be amazed at the information other sales associates will share with you
9005568 before presenting an offer ill often ask the other sales associate what its going to take to make a deal most of the time people will tell me
9005569 someone has to manage the negotiation it may as well be you
9005570 tell me again what is most appealing to you about this neighborhood
9005571 tell me what about the price seems inconsistent to you
9005572 people say things when they think no one is listening that will often ring true
9005573 often it wont be so it gives you a chance to clarify a position
9005574 always show respect for the other party and set a positive tone for the negotiation
9005575 buying a house is an incredibly emotional experience clients will trust you more if you appreciate their emotions their fear of getting a bad deal their excitement about moving their sadness at leaving their home of 30 years connecting with them on a human level will make the whole negotiation flow better
9005576 once he felt heard then i asked him to appreciate my perspective on wanting the terms fulfilled this set a tone of collegiality and it paid off
9005577 it looks like we have a shared problem you want to sell im interested in buying but we have some obstacles no whats your advice on moving forward
9005578 the crucial thing is to use your emotions rather than letting them use you
9005579 you can address anger by saying that your feel uncomfortable with the statement a person is making but never ever attack someone personally
9005580 what if we offered to reduce the price by 3 000 would you be willing to let my client stay in the house for another two weeks
9005581 such statements dont commit your client to anything but they open the door for a way to resolve a problem
9005582 analyze what and how the other side is disclosing information and use that as a guide for your own disclosures
9005583 youll have one batna when you begin a negotiation but once youve learned more about the other parties youll have to modify it still you should always have a point of no return
9005584 part of the salespersons job is to keep both parties focused on their goals that they want to buy or sell the home
9005585 sometimes they make a bad deal just so they can win
9005586 you have to differentiate between negotiating to produce an agreement and haggling
9005587 people who have made major concessions up front will perceive even minor concessions later as major stumbling blocks
9005588 once people have invested the energy in a negotiation the goal becomes more desirable always save the price for last
9005589 it works like a charm when the asking price and the offer price are fairly close
9005590 i know that this is 10 000 less than you wanted but when you compare months of 3 000 a month mortgage payments its not too off base
9005591 salespeople who get nervous during a silence and jump in with one more sentence or thought just display their own insecurity dont be afraid to be quiet and give the other person time to process the information youve shared so they can come around to your position
9005592 my seller could make the repairs indicated in the home inspection or we could give the buyer a check for 1 000 at closing to make the repairs
9005593 one of the biggest mistakes negotiators make is walking away too soon
9005594 if not i tell the sales associate that something has changed at the property and that they should take another look
9005595 providing new information is a great tactic for getting people back to the table
9005596 what they are trying to do is turn into individual rights that which attacks fundamental human rights of the person
9005597 are we not the witnesses of opinion campaigns and pressure from international powers to foster national legislation to introduce forms of liberalizing abortion and unrestricted bioethical manipulations of making same sex unions the equivalent of marriage of promoting eugenic and euthanasia practices
9005598 human rights cannot be arbitrary they must be universally applied and be well founded upon reason
9005599 hell protect a womans freedom of choice because government should have no say in whether or when a woman embraces the sacred responsibility of parenthood
9005600 they can choose what they want to choose and we can choose what we want to choose thats america thats what democracy means thats what freedom means thats what individual rights mean
9005601 we believe in the right to choose for our personal health and we know the right choice to protect that right to choose it is president barack obama and vice president joe biden
9005602 now you have to be pretty radical to have a zero rating
9005603 they want to essentially make it illegal for us to have a right to choose and to make us criminals and to make doctors criminals
9005604 we are in as much danger today as we were almost when we first started here there is so much at stake for women on this one issue and its critical that we elect barack obama
9005605 we probably cant stop it but we can change it next year
9005606 it was the right to control our reproductive systems that made it possible for almost all of us to achieve our own dreams which our parents had paid for
9005607 we do what we have to do for the survival of our children
9005608 we in the united states of america have to do this be politically engaged for the survival of our children and of children all over the world
9005609 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
9005610 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
9005611 a demonstration of what sen obama is trying to do in his campaign to reach out to people who might disagree on one issue or on more than one issue
9005612 try to bring people together even on the difficult issue of abortion
9005613 very hard for both the left and the right to just push aside and say you know what im not really interested
9005614 in my judgment neither party is doing enough on this issue
9005615 we have to do everything we can as a society and as a government to reach out and help pregnant women
9005616 we ought to make sure that she also has the option to carry that child to term
9005617 weve got to help her okay this isnt her problem its our problem
9005618 sometimes they are victims of abuse because they are pregnant
9005619 weve got to help that woman who is the subject of abuse
9005620 if youre not helping her if youre not trying to help her youre not pro life
9005621 to have a nurse or healthcare practitioner of some level of expertise assigned to her someone to give her health care advice someone who can counsel her someone who can visit her at home for as long as is possible
9005622 if they choose to bear that child theyre going to get all the help they need all the help they need
9005623 if we believe what we say we can come up with the money
9005624 but i dont agree with it i dont support it
9005625 but i think that there are ways even when we disagree on that particular legislation as it pertains to abortion that we can still come together
9005626 i dont spend a lot of time when were out there campaigning saying well i say this it doesnt agree with the platform
9005627 i would say that the abortion part of the platform wasnt good enough for me
9005628 tremendous progress and a very good thing to have in there and a very positive sign
9005629 i knew that response would be pulled out and seen over and over
9005630 i think it was poorly articulated i think it didnt reflect what he was trying to convey
9005631 sometimes pregnancy is a crisis and for some women it is a crisis for some its not but for some women it is a crisis thats a real challenge in their life
9005632 i dont think it reflects what he thinks about children or what he thinks about the birth of a child
9005633 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
9005634 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
9005635 abortion should be generally available to those who want it rather than under stricter limits or not permitted
9005636 or only be legal when the life of the mother is in danger or in cases of rape or incest
9005637 we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
9005638 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal healthcare parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
9005639 in the last 28 years we have seen huge differences and divisiveness on the issue of abortion in many situations quite frankly that issue alone has elected a member of congress to the house or a member of congress to the u s senate
9005640 its time that we take the politics out of abortion
9005641 for me it is time that the debate moves to a different level and that different level is the bill that we have introduced both republicans and democrats that will help reduce the number of abortions by up to 95 percent over the next 10 years
9005642 it is a blessing to know that at least for the first time our democratic party has made reducing abortions a major part of the democratic party platform
9005643 seventy percent believe that an abortion takes a life thats pretty startling
9005644 im excited that democrats at this convention are listening to those of us who believe that we have to champion the unborn child
9005645 the pregnant women support act is critical to achieving that
9005646 in 1973 nearly nine percent of births resulted in adoption by the year 2000 that had dropped to one percent why is that
9005647 democrats who are pro life democrats make a difference in our platform
9005648 as democrats weve got our work cut out for us no doubt
9005649 we dont talk enough about how this is a life issue
9005650 look as a church you can talk all you want we have to do something about it until you as a republican or you as a democrat does something about it it will only be talk
9005651 there is nothing greater than having my daughter sitting in my lap
9005652 as a community we should be able to show that by support for women who maybe have that uncertainty
9005653 we have to make a difference as pro life democrats and thats why im a strong supporter for democrats for life
9005654 reducing abortion should be something that both parties should agree on
9005655 but because someone failed the first nine months but then they do better the next nine months does that make your failure justified
9005656 i dont understand the analogy yes i hear it all the time what about after the baby gets here
9005657 well if i need a grant if i need an education if i need help i first have to get here
9005658 there hasnt been a big focus on the abortion issue at this convention and its very encouraging to hear people talk about helping pregnant women and to have pro life democrats leading and speaking at the convention being part of the party and also part of the platform
9005659 so its been a very encouraging week and weve had nothing but support people are welcoming us its been a very good week
9005660 no woman will abort unless she has a sense of abandonment and rejection
9005661 when a pregnant woman involved in an abusive or destructive relationship finds herself with an unplanned pregnancy one of the ways that she believes she can maintain what we call the traumatic emotional bond with her abuser is to allow her baby to be aborted
9005662 nobody talks about the 21 conclusive studies that show that abortion and breast cancer are linked
9005663 you need to be a pastor and talk to the women who are still hearing heartbeats who are still traumatized
9005664 one side uses it for grassroots the other side uses it monetarily and its very sad
9005665 azuela was the only one who brought medical and scientific questions to the discussions aimed at defining when life begins
9005666 i got up to have a look but the moment i got to the door i was attacked suddenly immediately i was struck on the head with a blow which made me totter
9005667 he put himself in front of me to try and defend me but he too was knocked down without mercy they hit him until he stopped crying out then they beat father salvatore and father martin as well it was terrible
9005668 presumably the attackers thought they would find riches at the monastery
9005669 we are just entering the historically active part of hurricane season
9005670 although tropical storm fay did not produce damaging high speed winds that a category 3 or 4 hurricane would have the resulting flood waters required a significant state response that was a very good tune up for our emergency response team
9005671 the public got to see the national guard at work guard members and vehicles moving from armories to affected communities providing assistance to people in distress
9005672 we are able meet our mission requirements by preparing sufficient numbers of guardsmen to meet any anticipated weather event
9005673 we have a great deal of recent experience and know that when one weather event has passed we could have another on the horizon it is critical to our long term success to have enough capable people available who are also rested and motivated
9005674 the reason we do that is to be able to cooperate with state agencies and local authorities
9005675 the guard has continuous contact and coordination with the florida division of emergency management in tallahassee and our joint emergency operations center and planning cells ensure the capability to rapidly build up personnel and equipment if needed

9005686 theres never been a better time to revisit the work of one of the original innovaters
9005687 for the past several years brian and i have shared a partnership that has brought rich rewards to the playhouse in every area thanks to his energy and dedication he leaves our theatre in a strong and much to be admired place the emergence of our theatre into a leadership position in the los angeles and national theatre community is largely due to the skill and insight that he has brought to the administrative operation of our company i am sure that he will bring the same intelligence and passion for the art on the stage to his new position at intiman theatre i forecast with great certainty that this new partnership that will have wonderful mutual rewards i wish him well as he begins his new journey in a much admired and dynamic theatre community
9005688 eleven years ago when i was an administrative assistant at pasadena playhouse sheldon epps became artistic director and brought a seemingly improbable dream that we could become a leading theatre in this nation wonderfully with sheldons leadership and tremendous support from our board and community we achieved virtually every goal we set for ourselves more than a decade ago somehow during that time i had the good fortune to become managing director now is the time for pasadena playhouse to dream new dreams and it is also the time for me to take on new challenges given the dynamic work of our artists in pasadena and what is in store i could only move to a theatre of equal professionalism passion and ambition in fact i was not seeking a change but when the intiman opportunity presented itself i instantly recognized a very special american theatre with a tremendous sense of community among its artists and supporters intiman has always been an innovative institution and it has accomplished so much in the last decade under the leadership of bart sher its challenge as presented to me by its board and staff leaders is to not to sit back and enjoy recent successes but to keep moving forward and to propel all of its artistry and creativity into the future this is a challenge that moved me at this stage of my career and i very much look forward to adding my efforts to the cause of supporting intiman

9005695 maybe i should get in the left lane so i will have less chance of hydroplaning
9005696 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9005697 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9005698 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9005699 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9005700 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board
9005701 windfall profits taxes alone prevent additional investment in domestic production without new supplies from american reserves our dependency and addiction to foreign sources of oil will continue
9005702 president bush is right here in alaska and across the nation communities are feeling the pinch of high energy costs it is absurd that we are borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars from one foreign country to buy oil from another it is a threat to our national security and economic well being it is well past time for america to develop our own supplies

9005750 i have done over 200 proposals for legal services in the last 5 6 years and i would have to say that very few of the rfps are well prepared some are way too ambiguous some are minutely detailed in relatively unimportant areas but silent on much more important ones and some are so restrictive that the bidder has no opportunity to demonstrate why it would be worth hiring them

9005826 given the current model predictions anyone who lives from mobile to new orleans to galveston should be very concerned about hurricane gustav and should be following it closely and developing an evacuation plan
9005827 this storm has the potential to become a very destructive hurricane the gulf of mexico is very warm this year creating conditions that are favorable to strong hurricane development gustav arriving near the third anniversary of hurricane katrina could follow a similar path the levee system along lake pontchartrain is still vulnerable to failure and the open coastline of mississippi and alabama is as vulnerable as it was before katrina
9005828 during a natural disaster such as a hurricane it is important to take advantage of the social support systems that are already in place in the community and to find ways to normalize the feelings of anxiety you are experiencing
9005829 this next hurricane makes vivid the issue that american cities can no longer be left vulnerable to climatic changes because of aging and outdated infrastructure
9005830 this is the lesson of rebuilding new orleans that can be transferred to drought burdened los angeles or the new york city region operating upon an obsolete power grid
9005831 it runs counter to lean thinking but could be useful under certain conditions
9005832 a hurricane is a giant heat engine drawing its strength from warm waters which is why we see the season intensify in late summer and early fall when ocean temperatures are highest this gives the storms a higher potential for destruction if they make landfall
9005833 there is about a 20 to 40 year cycle to sea surface temperatures and to hurricane activity in the atlantic the 1970s and 1980s were a relatively mild period now it appears we are entering a time of larger and more frequent storms however the overall trend to higher sea surface temperatures could make this a longer lasting situation
9005834 were comfortable with them because they run a good business
9005835 we began to look at options for ground west of springfield
9005836 but once we put things down on paper about building a new facility in springfield it came down to the fuel costs being too much for us to bear and still pay the mortgage for a new facility
9005837 we are rapidly increasing the amount of financial dollars we invest as a company into these kinds of facilities
9005838 right now our waste to energy and gas to energy plants produce enough power for over one million homes one of our goals as a corporation is to reach enough power produced for two million homes by 2020
9005839 we are only favourites if we show it on the pitch and not for the simple fact of the draw
9005840 they salzburg are a strong team powerful and they often play a direct style we need to be 100 and will have to apply ourselves well
9005841 they are a team who will undoubtedly be well motivated to face us and as such we must be very alert and focused to get through the tie
9005842 portuguese football as they have shown in the last few years has grown a lot and maritimo will want to contribute to the good spell their country is going through
9005843 we need to have the maximum respect for them they finished fifth in a strong league we must do things we well and get through to the next stage
9005844 i am sure it will be a good tie and we hope that it will be the first step to towards a successful uefa cup
9005845 it has been an honour to represent racing for the first time in this international meeting in monaco

9005853 die radwegeverbindung von menden nach hemer auf der ehemaligen bahntrasse muss kommen und sie muss mit blick auf die landesgartenschau bis sp testens 2010 kommen
9005854 die bestrebungen der mendener gr nen den r ckbau der bahntrasse zu verhindern entbehren nach ansicht der christdemokraten jeglicher sachlicher grundlage der schienenverkehr zwischen menden und hemer ist 1986 wegen mangelnder nachfrage eingestellt worden auch f r die zukunft sieht der zrl kein ausreichendes potential f r eine reaktivierung stadtverkehr schulverkehr der nachbarortsverkehr sowie der regionalverkehr nach iserlohn werden durch den busverkehr optimal meist sogar umsteigefrei und anders als beim schienenverkehr mit endpunkten in den innenst dten bedient wie der cdu kreistagsabgeordnete und mvg aufsichtsratsmitglied peter maywald recherchierte sind seit der neuordnung des stadt und regionalverkehrs die fahrgastzahlen im nachbarorts und regionalverkehr ber hemer von 816 pro tag in 2003 auf 1066 im jahr 2008 gestiegen
9005855 warum soll also eine weder wirtschaftlich tragbare noch von den eigentlichen nutzern akzeptierte schienenverbindung erhalten werden nach ansicht der cdu menden hat man nun die einmalige chance nach aufgabe der eisenbahntrasse die fehlende radwegeverbindung nach hemer einzurichten uns erstaunt es dass gerade die gr nen die sich sonst allerorten f r den ausbau von radwegen einsetzen hier den bau eines solchen torpedieren

9005857 someone else made this crap up lets see if it comes true
9005858 for the first time since the crimean war russia has no allies
9005859 we are encircled by countries that are either suspicious or alienated and very angry
9005860 unless they are russia dedicated they will move to friendlier environments sentiment is just very bad
9005861 russia is extremely cheap and most of the growth dynamics are still in place
9005862 if i look forward 12 months i want to own russia
9005863 if there is a perception of russia as a risky place or as an undesirable place to invest then the damage will be more long term
9005864 it will restrict the development of the economy and hurt the governments plans to create a more diversified the economy
9005865 it is big aggressive undemocratic and irresponsible georgia who took small and innocent south ossetia
9005866 are sad about the situation and i have had many e mails from people asking why the media is reporting the situation only from one side
9005867 this is a strategic and long term mistake the effects of which will be felt by virtually all russians
9005868 democratic values and cooperation with the west will be seen as a betrayal
9005869 but its going to turn up a couple of notches its not a trend reversal
9005870 companies have a tremendous amount of very sensitive data on their customers and while a company itself may treat that responsibly if the court orders it be turned over theres not a lot that the company that holds the data can do
9005871 what were seeing is that the theoretical is becoming real world
9005872 the more data youve got the more data thats going to be there as an attractive kind of treasure chest for outside parties
9005873 this decision makes it absolutely clear that everywhere we go online we leave tracks and every piece of information we access online leaves some sort of record
9005874 as consumers we should all be aware of the fact that this sensitive information is being collected about us
9005875 there are some circumstances under which what seems to be private information is going to be shared with a third party and the court says its ok to do that

9005913 his advice was just to be prepared go out there and play my game and to enjoy the atmosphere and the experience
9005914 i dont know whats been finalised yet but hopefully i will be in the squad and play a part in the game
9005915 the mls is still a league that is developing although the level of play has increased
9005916 but this is a team who play in the uefa cup and the champions league and who play against the best players in the world

9005922 in quel periodo correvamo entrambi per la honda per cui capitava spesso di dover andare a tokyo alla hrc in inverno stavamo assieme per diversi giorni e ricordo daijiro come un ragazzo speciale molto dolce io sinceramente avevo anche abbastanza paura di lui perch nella motogp quando arrivato andato subito molto forte abbiamo fatto tante lotte il primo anno quando gli stata data la rcv a quattro tempi la mia stessa moto era molto veloce in pista e aveva uno stile di guida impeccabile molto pulito per mi ricordo soprattutto che era un ragazzzo molto simpatico e molto dolce il ricordo ancora molto caldo perch noi eravamo in pista a suzuka quel giorno stato uno shock per tutti

9005926 newsletters can claim they have achieved any performance number they wish even if it is not true and their claim is protected under the first amendment
9005927 another interesting source of investment information is newsletters that you can buy for a few hundred dollars per year the investment results of some of these newsletters look impressive and they should in 1985 the u s supreme court ruled that newsletters were exempt from the investment advisors act of 1940 and therefore not subject to sec regulation that means courts view newsletters as journalistic works and as a result newsletters can claim they have achieved any performance number they wish even if it is not true and their claim is protected under the first amendment
9005928 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
9005929 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her
9005930 by that time you say you were in love with her and somehow convinced yourself it was appropriate to continue
9005931 that was immature and irresponsible on your part but i accept that you were not acting as a predator
9005932 youre an immature and irresponsible little boy so we cannot hold you fully accountable but let this be a lesson to you and about those additional 9 visits to the store where you repeated the original crime i know how you love that store so ill pretend they never happened
9005933 are you sure you have tested an actually i do have a fee only advisor lined up as well as a cpa and estate planning attorney should this actually finally end

9005946 given the current model predictions anyone who lives from mobile to new orleans to galveston should be very concerned about hurricane gustav and should be following it closely and developing an evacuation plan
9005947 this storm has the potential to become a very destructive hurricane the gulf of mexico is very warm this year creating conditions that are favorable to strong hurricane development gustav arriving near the third anniversary of hurricane katrina could follow a similar path the levee system along lake pontchartrain is still vulnerable to failure and the open coastline of mississippi and alabama is as vulnerable as it was before katrina
9005948 during a natural disaster such as a hurricane it is important to take advantage of the social support systems that are already in place in the community and to find ways to normalize the feelings of anxiety you are experiencing
9005949 this next hurricane makes vivid the issue that american cities can no longer be left vulnerable to climatic changes because of aging and outdated infrastructure
9005950 this is the lesson of rebuilding new orleans that can be transferred to drought burdened los angeles or the new york city region operating upon an obsolete power grid
9005951 it runs counter to lean thinking but could be useful under certain conditions
9005952 a hurricane is a giant heat engine drawing its strength from warm waters which is why we see the season intensify in late summer and early fall when ocean temperatures are highest this gives the storms a higher potential for destruction if they make landfall
9005953 there is about a 20 to 40 year cycle to sea surface temperatures and to hurricane activity in the atlantic the 1970s and 1980s were a relatively mild period now it appears we are entering a time of larger and more frequent storms however the overall trend to higher sea surface temperatures could make this a longer lasting situation

9005959 there is a well documented issue surrounding the owner of the football club
9005960 it is a situation people have an interest in worldwide
9005961 but he has shown his commitment to the club by this investment in it and i am determined to take it to the next level
9005962 we have been waiting a long time for people to start writing positive things
9005963 the signings of people like shaun we hope will make people change their view of manchester city because there is too much negativity about what is happening here
9005964 it is well documented we are looking to bring in more finance
9005965 if we want to take manchester city to the next level we need a significant amount of money millionaires do not have enough you need billionaires that is the way of the world
9005966 dr thaksin knows some very wealthy guys if anyone can bring it into the club it will certainly be him
9005967 we hope the deal will be concluded because he is the right quality we have time so i think it will be okay
9005968 i will not allow players to leave unless i feel it will make the club stronger and whether they go or not will be my decision
9005969 maybe i needed to reassure people that what is being reported is not quite what the situation is

9005990 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
9005991 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
9005992 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
9005993 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
9005994 he was trying to establish his role against a public perception that mccain might be stronger in a crisis situation
9005995 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
9005996 he would be the right future president as long as he does what he promises
9005997 i like his idea to relieve the middle class by reducing taxes
9005998 and a retreat in iraq will be necessary because it is not good for a country to spent too much money on war
9005999 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
9006000 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
9006001 is a visionary and would certainly be a sort of fresh breeze on capitol hill
9006002 i think german people would vote in favour of him and hopefully america will do so
9006003 since hillary rodham clinton announced her support he has a true chance of winning the election

9006010 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9006011 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9006012 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected watch video of sen mccain introducing gov sarah palin as his running mate browse a slide show of photos of gov palin discuss mccains pick in west watch selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9006013 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9006014 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9006015 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9006016 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9006017 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9006018 i am pleased with sen mccains pick for vice president gov palin is an outstanding terrific pick for the job for the country for the republican party and for the citizens we try to serve
9006019 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9006020 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief

9006039 we are delighted to make ibrahima the clubs latest signing
9006040 he is a quality addition to the squad and comes with plenty of premier league experience having played in the top flight with reading
9006041 ibrahima sonko has been a terrific performer in the clubs recent development
9006042 but centre half is a particularly strong position for us in terms of both quality and quantity especially with the continuing emergence of alex pearce who adds to the experience offered by ivar ingimarsson michael duberry and andre bikey
9006043 bearing that in mind we felt the timing is right for this deal and it is probably a good time for ibrahima to seek a fresh challenge
9006044 another related feature that has changed significantly and for the better is bbedits find differences in bbedit 8 5 bare bones added the capability to display which characters within a line were different between two similar files that was huge for us since it enabled us to use bbedit in conjunction with the subversion version control system to work with tidbits articles though code may have relatively short lines a line of prose is a paragraph and without knowing what within a paragraph has changed knowing only that two paragraphs are not the same isnt particularly helpful in bbedit 9 0 bare bones has enhanced the find differences feature such that it not only shows the changed lines and the changed characters within each line it also lets you see and replace individual spans of differing characters within each changed line
9006045 right from the get go the movie dares to blur the line between good and bad in its treatment of jihadists vs anti terror agents its refreshing to feel a twinge of sympathy for a potential mass murderer and simultaneously cheer on government agents for whom acceptable loss is a playbook go to

9006102 i dont view these statistics as a problem but a chance for gods name to be great among a generation that is spiritual but not religious
9006103 what we found is that young adults desire to do life together
9006104 they desire relational equity and community that goes beyond casual hellos they want to pour their lives into each other
9006105 it will be a failure if we raise a generation who are just friends growing in the likeness of christ is essential
9006106 what we found in our research is that young adults who are churched are saying if we are going to stand for truth in a world that is not standing for truth we want to be equipped
9006107 the unchurched are saying we are not going to make a decision at face value
9006108 teach the whole bible foster discussion and answer the difficult questions of faith
9006109 offer quality exegetical bible teaching and sing theologically sound music that accurately depicts the word of god
9006110 for both church and unchurched young adults we have found that both recognize that their choices make a difference and they want to improve the world around them
9006111 as a result of this heightened sense of responsibility we can help create a door for service and evangelism
9006112 as we continue to understand younger adults and what theyre looking for we must recognize the heavy value they place on connecting with people who have more life experience than they do
9006113 some would call this mentoring or cross generational ministry the bottom line is that they want to learn from someone elses experiences theyre looking for a connection with the church and a connection with people who are willing to walk alongside them and give a little advice here and there
9006114 if an absence exists between what you say and what you do young adults will become quickly disinterested
9006115 if you desire for your church to be a healthy body that raises the banner of intergenerational ministry you need to personally invest in this generation as well

9006123 seen through the prism of sunlight and glittering leaves four backyards tells the story of four inhabitants of the same suburban town over the course of one curious autumn day the appearance of normalcy is delicately fractured in the quartet of tales a businessman with marital troubles gets lost on a business trip without ever leaving home a little girl who steals her mothers jewelry finds herself tangled in a web of frightening adult implications a well meaning housewife offers her celebrity neighbor a lift and the trip detours into profoundly unsettling territory for both of them and lastly a head trauma victim with amnesia assumes a new personality with the help of a lost dog

9006129 250 000 to 300 000 to establish the kind of great bookstore i have in mind
9006130 you have to make the store a destination for people to come and discuss literature and not just buy books
9006131 while fort greene is one of the premiere restaurant destinations in the city the residents have voiced a desire for some missing retail basics like a general interest bookstore or a bakery that makes its own bread and desserts
9006132 its a tough business you have to sell a lot of books to make any money in new york city

9006139 we are just entering the historically active part of hurricane season

9006348 trotz starken umsatzwachstums und marktanteilsgewinnen hat dell wegen zu aggressiver preissenkungen die erwartungen verfehlt
9006349 non abbiamo bisogno di luci io sono il sostituto del sole
9006350 liberi da sempre siamo liberi da tutto e niente liberi per sempre noi slegami se la mia solitudine vorrei soltanto vivere lamore che non c perch tu vuoi solo pi di quel che dai
9006351 probably the biggest challenge has been the size of our area of operations
9006352 and to answer how weve overcome that challenge i summed it up in one word marines
9006353 we want them to become a more proficient respectable and legitimate force which is really an extension of the government on the district level
9006354 we cant always have the right amount of recruits out of each district so we have to recruit from other districts
9006355 when they go through the training and come back those anp have an expectation that they are going to go back to the district they came from and sometimes we cannot do that
9006356 the solution isnt going to be so much the numbers of people that you bring in here it is the effect on the people that we have in the context of doing our mission which is i call it turning four into 40
9006357 the bottom line is we want to give these people liberty
9006358 to create conditions where they can take responsibility of their own affairs and provide for their own future
9006359 do you really think that chose to do it are you seeing these pictures people are the same everywhere yes therefore i know how free girls behave trust me these girls if they could would drop these black covers in one second
9006360 their very existence distracts men from focusing on holy god so they must cover themselves up
9006361 cause islam seize to spread democracy not by forcing but by giving u the ideas of whats best and let you do what u want cause in the end your responsible for your actions
9006362 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9006363 he said make sure you listen to the news from hunting camp i should have put two and two together
9006364 those occasions when hes broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9006365 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9006366 tonight tonight i say to the people of america to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9006367 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9006368 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit cards bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
9006369 now these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9006370 let me say to the people of mississippi this is not a time to panic but it is a time to get prepared
9006371 the blessing if there is one is that its a three day weekend
9006372 the storm is a long way off people have a lot of time
9006373 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9006374 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
9006375 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
9006376 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
9006377 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
9006378 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
9006379 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level so were clearly better prepared
9006380 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right
9006381 come on guys be statesmen and use this as an opportunity to educate the public about how important it is to fully fund firefighters to educate the public and to be prepared
9006382 listen to the guy thats been on the mountaintop and listen to the guy thats been down into the valley of you know where nothing worked and listen to what i have to say
9006383 i knew i need a triple so as soon as i hit the ball im going to go to third
9006384 they were going all crazy and i was just thinking about boone a little bit
9006385 but as soon as he hit the ball everybody was go three go three go three all the way
9006386 i didnt know what was going on until everybody went to screaming
9006387 i was just trying to sit there and get some air or whatever and i look at the board because everybody was screaming in the dugout and i was like oh thats why so i went to screaming too
9006388 you get that two run lead in the first inning its kind of the last thing you want to do is give up runs especially that many
9006389 we have to go out there and win a ball game to start making us feel good right now it doesnt feel too good
9006390 it was just a great feeling in a season full of some not so happy memories
9006391 weve been playing well of late and its just good to see smiles on everyones face
9006392 is she an amazing speaker or someone who has had the ability to run an immense campaign and receive huge plaudits for it
9006393 can i just say and it may have been mentioned before that this gives hillary a huge incentive to campaign for barack she doesnt want this woman cracking the ceiling
9006394 a presidnet should be a mentor to the vice president not the other way around
9006395 would a male governor of a population wise tiny state with next to no experience when your major attack is experience and no obvious counterbalancing amazing standout qualities have been picked
9006396 one measure of how well john mccain kept his choice of a vice presidential running mate secret is that 67 of voters nationwide have no opinion one way or the other about alaska governor sarah palin the latest rasmussen reports national telephone survey shows that she is unknown to 78 of women in fact among 10 leading republicans included in the poll palins name was the least recognized however in alaska the 44 year old governor and hockey mom earns good or excellent ratings from 64 of voters statewide
9006397 female governor from alaska who has an accent straight out of fargo
9006398 theres a red headed and hes got a baby with him god theyre beautiful they are so beautiful
9006399 and were going to measure the diameter of the tree how high the nest cavity is the species of the tree is it alive or is it dead so we can get some data on what seems to be the preferred habitat
9006400 the woodpecker is called a primary nester it digs the cavity but flying squirrels mice snakes bluebirds tree swallows there are lots of other animals that are secondary nesters they cant drill the hole but they live there so what were trying to do is preserve the habitat so the woodpeckers drill the hole and when they leave something else will come in and live in it
9006401 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9006402 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9006403 weve come in as underdogs and have hit our straps in every single department
9006404 the blokes have done an amazing job but we want to improve and want to try to win the series 5 0 if we can
9006405 its nice to be able to click your fingers and have fast bowlers running in at 90mph theyve done an amazing job over the last two weeks
9006406 and the fielding over the last couple of weeks has been second to none
9006407 theres such a fine line between scoring runs and not doing but ive worked with phil watching the ball onto the bat and its nice when you score a few
9006408 its more about timing and stroking the ball and stats suggest i score better batting at five getting in when the seamers are still on and accelerating at the death
9006409 i dont think ive bowled particularly well in the three one dayers but jimmy anderson and stuart broad bowled very well today
9006410 were not playing good cricket at the moment but i think england are playing unbelievable cricket and are outplaying us in every department
9006411 weve lost a few key players but we probably lost the game in the first 10 to 15 overs today as chasing 300 was always going to be an uphill battle
9006412 we arent firing on all cylinders we came here to win the test cricket but we pride ourselves on our performances and we dont want people to forget what weve achieved here
9006413 on the specific question of where packaged goods will go there are two factions but im clearly in the camp that doesnt think its going to go away before i retire
9006414 the reason why im so convinced is that ive always been saying our softare developers eat up storage space so much quicker than telcos can build distribution
9006415 i mean we used to be below 1gb but were now building games that have 8 9 10gb and if broadband distribution is going to allow 10gb to be distributed in half an hour well have games that are 100gb because the graphical resolution increases
9006416 the content size of games say need for speed the size of the open world that you can use increases so you just need more and more storage space which is going to again make the pipeline a big bottleneck
9006417 so i think there will still be a need for a physical distribution starter and then services and additional content can be distributed online
9006418 have the resources or time to add a fourth race to the launch
9006419 one of the things that we have to change in our religion is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and faith
9006420 vamos a estar capacitando a todos los miembros de las juntas receptoras del voto desde las 8 de la ma ana hasta las 10h30 de once a una y en la tarde tambi n vamos a estar aqu en el auditorio del tribunal
9006421 responsabilidad individual y responsabilidad mutua sa es la esencia de la promesa americana
9006422 ahora bien no creo que al senador mccain no le importe lo que est pasando en las vidas de los estadounidenses creo que simplemente no lo sabe por qu otro motivo habr a identificado entonces a la clase media como alguien que gana menos de 5 millones de d lares al a o por qu si no habr a propuesto cientos de miles de millones de d lares para exenciones fiscales para las grandes empresas y compa as petrol feras pero ni un s lo penique de beneficios fiscales para los m s de 100 millones de ciudadanos estadounidenses c mo si no podr a ofrecer un plan de atenci n sanitaria que en realidad fiscalizar a los beneficios de los ciudadanos o un plan de educaci n que no ayudar a en forma alguna a las familias a pagar los colegios o un plan para la privatizaci n de la seguridad social que pondr a en riesgo vuestra jubilaci n no es porque a john mccain no le importe es por que a john mccain se le escapa durante m s de dos d cadas se ha mantenido fiel a la trasnochada y desacreditada filosof a republicana dar m s y m s a aquellos que m s tienen y esperar a que la prosperidad impregne a todos los dem s en washington a esto lo llaman la sociedad de la propiedad pero lo que significa en realidad es que estamos solos en paro mala suerte sin atenci n sanitaria el mercado se ocupar de ello nacido en la pobreza defi ndete con u as y dientes aunque te quedes sin ambos est s solo ya es hora de que reconozcan su error ya es hora de que cambiemos estados unidos
9006423 cu l es esa promesa es una promesa que dice que cada uno de nosotros es libre para llevar la vida que quiera pero que tambi n tenemos la obligaci n de tratar a los dem s con dignidad y respeto es una promesa que dice que el mercado deber a recompensar la iniciativa y la innovaci n y generar crecimiento pero que las empresas deber an estar a la altura de sus responsabilidades para crear puestos de trabajo para los estadounidenses cuidar a sus trabajadores estadounidenses y respetar las reglas del juego la nuestra es una promesa que dice que el gobierno no puede resolver todos nuestros problemas pero que deber a hacer aquello que nosotros no podemos por nosotros mismos protegernos ante el da o y ofrecer a cada ni o una educaci n decente mantener el agua limpia y los juguetes seguros invertir en nuevas escuelas y nuevas carreteras y en la innovaci n cient fica y tecnol gica
9006424 como presidente explotar las reservas de gas natural de nuestro pa s invertir en tecnolog a de carb n limpio y buscar formas para aprovechar la energ a nuclear de forma segura ayudar a nuestras empresas de automoci n a renovar sus herramientas para que los veh culos de combustible eficiente del futuro se fabriquen aqu en estados unidos har que los estadounidenses puedan permitirse comprar estos veh culos invertir 150 000 millones de d lares en la pr xima d cada en fuentes de energ a renovables asequibles energ a e lica y energ a solar y en la nueva generaci n de biocarburantes una inversi n que generar nuevas industrias y 5 millones de nuevos puestos de trabajo bien remunerados y que no podr n contratarse fuera estados unidos no es momento para los peque os planes
9006425 cuando john mccain dijo que en afganist n podr amos
9006426 que no me digan que no podemos respetar la segunda enmienda y a la vez evitar que un ak 47 llegue a manos de los criminales soy consciente de que existen diferencias de opini n en cuanto a los matrimonios entre personas del mismo sexo pero estoy seguro de que podemos estar de acuerdo en que nuestros hermanos gays y nuestras hermanas lesbianas tienen derecho a visitar a la persona que aman en el hospital y a vivir una vida libre de discriminaci n si se trata de inmigraci n el debate es apasionado pero no conozco a nadie que resulte beneficiado cuando se separa a una madre de su beb o a cuando un empresario recorta costes salariales contratando a trabajadores ilegales
9006427 mantengamos esa promesa esa promesa de estados unidos y como dicen las escrituras aferrarnos firmemente sin flaquear a la esperanza que confesamos gracias que dios os bendiga y que dios bendiga a los estados unidos de am rica
9006428 responsabilidad individual y responsabilidad mutua sa es la esencia de la promesa americana
9006429 it looked like a meth lab but there were some things that were missing
9006430 so we threw our heads together and figured out they were making mescaline
9006431 you know a possible career ending injury really puts sports into perspective
9006432 yeah you just got up wilson gamecocks cockn fire mother
9006433 there is no question that russias influence in the world and in eastern europe will grow
9006434 i am confident that foreign investors will be protected as long as they foreign investors do not try to take control of strategic sectors
9006435 however the whole emerging markets world is full of opportunities in view of the general decline in prices
9006436 hope its palin i would vote twice just to stick it to obama
9006437 yay mccain need to put her on his myspace main pic than they will go in my top friends
9006438 hoo ray fu k the dnc fu k obama they are so fu k up they brushed off the women base like dirt and the gop pick them up go mccain go go og
9006439 omg buuuuurn obama buuuurn what a slap in the face if its palin i will put blood and sweat into campaigning for that team
9006440 do you all hear the sound of the running feet of all the women the obama camp tossed aside it is thunderous
9006441 mccain has picked palin i am thrilled as for the dums whining that she doenst have experience running things she has five kids trust me she knows how to run things
9006442 i thought when you had kids that there were all these things that were gonna have to happen tell em about this or that sit them down and play them music and show them what art is all about
9006443 but they come out singing before he could talk cosimo age 4 had his favorite songs and they werent songs i played him
9006444 se encontraban perdidos en la vida ella en su ruidosa ciudad y l en la silenciosa monta a dos personas muy diferentes unidos por una ni a muy especial un anillo y una atracci n que no pueden manejar

9006446 this unit will help meet a huge need in our community regarding helping people with psychiatric substance abuse or disability issues
9006447 it will allow people to be treated at their home their school their work or other settings rather than having them entering a hospital setting or being hospitalized to resolve their crisis
9006448 in part because of a lack of adequate community based mental health crisis services
9006449 we need to have something like a 24 hour walk in clinic to evaluate and treat people going through a mental health or substance abuse crisis in a more appropriate and less restrictive environment
9006450 within 30 miles or 30 minutes of every resident in the state
9006451 was recognition by the general assembly that there is a tremendous assessment gap in the state
9006452 but even with the expansion of the mobile crisis teams we will continue to struggle with lacking enough resources to meet the entire need
9006453 the center that forsyth is planning is a step in the right direction as well
9006454 i am not pro abortion i am against government enforced maternity

9006478 it is to gov sarah palins credit that her attorney generals office ruled that invited participation by any state official in the kenai river classic is intended to influence decisions and is subject to ethics laws
9006479 there were many potential vp candidates who might have helped norm coleman for instance tim pawlenty might have brought more mccain attention to minnesota and mitt romney might be the only politician in america who makes norm look authentic by comparison but instead mccain picked an alaskan whose political capital was built by taking on the same corruption scandal currently enveloping colemans campaign this will only increase the attention paid to this scandal and thats bad news for norm coleman
9006480 intended to influence decisions and is subject to ethics laws
9006481 with the future of the state at stake through controversial mining developments a multibillion dollar gas line and the continuing battle over fish allocation it is to gov sarah palins credit that her attorney generals office ruled that invited participation by any state official in the kenai river classic is intended to influence decisions and is subject to ethics laws
9006482 after a near miss run in the republican primary for lieutenant governor in 2002 palin set her sights on the states top office four years later she campaigned on a platform of reform and was aided by the fact that the public had tired of gov frank murkowksi and that the looming veco scandal which would come to badly imperil the states republicans had begun to get real traction
9006483 powerful lobbyists in the arms oil mining and tourist industries are invited and they come to get close to senators and high government officials to advance their cause
9006484 lawmakers will stand in line to support gov sarah palins alaska gasline inducement act if only because veco doesnt like the plan and in this post indictment era no borderline smart lawmaker will risk doing anything that hints at an allegiance to veco

9006503 theres less than 1 percent of the population of iowa that is african american there is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
9006504 this was not a race based distinction but a discussion of the problems kids face who dont have the same socio economic support system and all that implies nutrition pre k etc entering grade school and the impact of those disadvantages on outcomes
9006505 the real racist here is tubbs and all his leftist ilk who no matter what dont want white men to have a voice
9006506 failure or success in life simply indicates to me why one might pursue certain arguments
9006507 im asking our legislative candidates to vote for a constitutional convention

9006509 in new york theres no way for the people to change things
9006510 its the three men in a room way of making policy
9006511 no its just better than complaining about individual issues three delegates from each senatorial ditrict elected by the people would convene and draft constitutional amendments they would advocate for change
9006512 voters will judge whether living in a foreign country at the age of 10 prepares one to face the big complex international challenges the next president will face
9006513 i think we need a president with more experience than that

9006552 we mistankenly learned that our happiness depends on getting our needs met externally we formed a strong belief in a personal identity whose worth was based on having owning getting becoming doing and achieving insted of on the the pristine and unchangeable essence of our united self we were encouraged to aquire knowledge by observing and learning from the people and experiences yet we are not taught how to observe our own thoughts and emotions or to question and limiting beliefs
9006553 finding intimacy begins with discovering ourselves not with fixing and controlling outselves or our partners we have to be visible before we can be seen we have to be available before our hearts can be affected
9006554 concious love emerges from the commitment to experiencing and sharing love for the highest good of all involved
9006555 his past has no reality in the present so you can not see it
9006556 when we or our patners withdraw this specialness it appears that love itself is withdrawn for so long we have over identified with this pseudo love and have not yet seen and felt the enormous benifits gained by learning to relate truthfully though the united relationship
9006557 there are no accidents there are no problems and there is no one whom you are not ment to meet
9006558 having a significant other with whom we can interact presents us with the opportunity to practice forgivness while we may get many chances to forgive we may also be challanged by a common frustration

9006575 einzige chance w re bei den firmen anzurufen und zu fragen ob das so richtig ist doch meistens gibt es verschwiegenheitsklauseln in lizenzvertr gen so dass die beteiligten keine auskunft geben d rfen
9006576 eine firma die eine entwicklung macht will die nat rlich sch tzen lassen aber bis das patentverfahren und die gewerblichen schutzrechte durch alle instanzen sind k nnen oft jahre vergehen
9006577 bis es so weit ist kommt es vor dass andere firmen die entwicklung einfach nutzen ohne lizenzgeb hren zu zahlen wenn dann das patentverfahren irgendwann durch ist geht nat rlich das geklage los

9006679 will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9006680 i tell ya i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9006681 im used to being very productive and working real hard and in administration
9006682 we want to make sure that the v p slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up her for the rest of the us before i can even start addressing that question
9006683 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9006684 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president
9006685 she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match
9006686 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president
9006687 so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9006688 the only similarity between palin and hillary clinton is that they are both women
9006689 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary clinton left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceilings in american
9006690 but it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can still shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9006691 although we werent able to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling this time thanks to you its got about 18 million cracks in it
9006692 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9006693 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9006694 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9006695 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9006696 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9006697 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9006698 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9006699 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9006700 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9006701 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9006702 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9006703 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9006704 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9006705 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9006706 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9006707 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9006708 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9006709 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9006710 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9006711 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9006712 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9006713 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9006714 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9006715 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9006716 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9006717 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9006718 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9006719 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9006720 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9006721 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9006722 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9006723 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9006724 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9006725 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9006726 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9006727 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9006728 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9006729 who are open to doing something on the production side
9006730 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9006731 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9006732 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9006733 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9006734 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9006735 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9006736 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9006737 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9006738 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9006739 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9006740 my government had been successful in launching different welfare schemes including rs two per kg rice for poor people while only a few important families harvested all benefits during the previous congress rule
9006741 more than 55 lakh families got benefit from the scheme
9006742 the treasury was empty while corruption and nepotism were order of the day

9006746 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9006747 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9006748 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9006749 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9006750 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9006751 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9006752 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9006753 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9006754 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9006755 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9006756 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9006757 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9006758 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9006759 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9006760 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

9006806 the reasons people file for personal bankruptcy indeed have shifted during the past couple of decades
9006807 although our research supports the notion that adverse life events like losing ones health or job contribute to personal bankruptcy filings excessive consumption contributes more to the recent increase in personal bankruptcy filing
9006808 our results emphasize that bankruptcy law reform should aim to address the issue
9006809 current means test focusing on income rather than consumption patterns or adverse events may not set the best criteria for sorting out the households who truly need bankruptcy protection from those that consume beyond their means to take advantage of the system
9006810 its better to be home than away before premier league games i must say but it depends as well on what kind of position you are in the group stage of the champions league
9006811 it depends on what sort of security you have in the champions league group stage at that time
9006812 basically for the quality of the premier league its good that so many teams are in europe and they stay in for as long as possible it evens a little bit the physical strain on all the teams in the premier league
9006813 it gives you an edge in the premier league if you qualify early because you are not under stress to give absolutely everything in one important group game the fourth fifth or sixth that could give you an edge
9006814 but it is very difficult to predict as well that you will qualify early for example manchester united have villarreal we know by experience that to go to villarreal is not easy

9006819 it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition
9006820 for instance naming guitar hero world tour coming up with the new guitar hero rock band so they said come up with a name and i did and it became guitar hero world tour

9006824 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile

9006882 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica

9006884 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia

9006947 so who do you think mccain should choose for a running mate
9006948 she takes away the woman issue the historic glass ceiling breakthrough element of the hillary to obama handoff candidacy
9006949 she has a reputation for standing up to the corrupt old guard players from both parties she filed ethics charges against a long standing republican powerhouse on that oil commission
9006950 she ran for governor without a lot of big money backing and she really is not beholden to any machine
9006951 she has done very well in her early budget battles in alaska and people really respect her tenacity
9006952 she has been married for twenty years and has five children a real family person who walks the walk
9006953 she is just forty four years old very energetic and vigorous which offsets the fact that mccain has more rings around the trunk
9006954 she has a son who enlisted in the army and is about to be deployed in iraq
9006955 it probably doesnt hurt that she was runner up for miss alaska but i wouldnt want to be quoted on that

9007017 within the coming days georgia will withdraw all diplomats from its embassy in moscow
9007018 consular relations with the russian federation will be maintained it is a downgrade of diplomatic relations not a complete cut
9007019 orders the executive power to cut diplomatic ties with the russian federation
9007020 we have seen them as peacekeepers in not the normal places
9007021 they are trying to create a de facto situation quickly before mondays summit
9007022 its not a control not a checkpoint its a camp
9007023 we are trying to find positive proposals for georgia and visa free travel is one of these
9007024 i felt throughout the mission that human rights issues have been secondary to other considerations
9007025 there are refugees and displaced people on both sides in the tens of thousands
9007026 my main mission is for all displaced people to have the right to return to where they lived before the conflict
9007027 human rights watch researchers personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages during their research in the area
9007028 these satellite images indicate just how widespread the torching of these villages has been in the last two weeks
9007029 the evidence overwhelmingly showed that defendant was a racist who regarded non whites as subhuman and who by his own admission callously murdered victim ly for the racial movement
9007030 i stabbed him in the side about 7 or 8 times he rolled over a little so i stabbed his back about 18 or 19 times then he layed flat and i slit one side of his throught on his jugular vain
9007031 oh the sounds the guy was making were like uhhh
9007032 life is a series of problems either you are in one now youre just coming out of one or youre getting ready to go into another one the reason for this is that god is more interested in your character than your comfort he is more interested in making your life holy than he is in making it happy we can be reasonably happy here on this earth but that is not the goal of life the goal is to grow in character in christs likeness
9007033 a major challenge is that the roads are crowded its becoming like hosur road in bangalore we need help from the government
9007034 it is a premature judgment once the work is completed the traffic will flow smoothly we also want it companies to resort to car pooling and to stop parking their buses on the road as that reduces road space
9007035 its definitely going to put pressure on margins for those in the travel industry but its the markets call
9007036 for me the running is not as tiresome but i didnt think standing was going to be so exhausting

9007041 we discussed the need to bring in a strategic partner to the company who would act as more than a pure financial investor the expertise which the partner will bring in will help uti mf to accelerate its growth
9007042 were just very dependent on whether or not people feel they have disposable income to spend
9007043 gas prices have cut deeply into any entertainment money for things i used to enjoy once in a while
9007044 one never knows whats going to happen with respect to natural gas prices
9007045 but if they hold at todays levels people are going to be getting some pretty sizable natural gas bills around the first of december and thats going to be a damper on holiday shopping

9007047 russia completely lost the information war in the first few days

9007060 afford to have one in five young people not contributing
9007061 it is simply unacceptable for teenagers not to have the life and work skills necessary for getting and holding a job
9007062 the government is committed to investing substantially in our schools to deliver better outcomes
9007063 but we will not be making those investments without demanding greater accountability in return i cannot understand why public institutions such as schools should not be accountable to the community that funds their salaries and running costs right now we do not have accurate comprehensive information to allow rigorous analysis of what schools and students are achieving this must change parents have a right to information to inform their familys decision making about school enrolment
9007064 walk with their feet thats exactly what the system is designed to do

9007069 we are interested to know why suu kyi did not meet gambari
9007070 we were surprised that the officials were so impolite shouting with a loudspeaker outside the gate of aung san suu kyis residence
9007071 during the 1990 election we recorded suu kyis speeches and secretly listened to them
9007072 military personnel and their families also want political and social changes
9007073 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9007074 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9007075 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9007076 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9007077 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9007078 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9007079 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9007080 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9007081 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9007082 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9007083 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9007084 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9007085 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9007086 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9007087 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9007088 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9007089 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9007090 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9007091 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9007092 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9007093 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9007094 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9007095 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9007096 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9007097 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9007098 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9007099 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9007100 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9007101 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9007102 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9007103 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9007104 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9007105 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9007106 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9007107 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9007108 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9007109 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9007110 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9007111 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9007112 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9007113 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9007114 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9007115 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
9007116 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
9007117 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

9007128 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9007129 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9007130 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9007131 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

9007142 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9007143 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9007144 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9007145 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9007146 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9007147 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9007148 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9007149 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9007150 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9007151 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9007152 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9007153 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9007154 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9007155 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9007156 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9007157 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9007158 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9007159 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9007160 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9007161 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9007162 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9007163 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9007164 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9007165 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9007166 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9007167 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9007168 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9007169 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9007170 no one works for someone we all just work together

9007172 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9007173 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9007174 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9007175 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9007176 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

9007185 stand in a big circle and lift the parachute into the air and take turns running underneath it to the other side
9007186 all of us know that several people are still being kidnapped every week
9007187 at least ten people from my tribe alone all of them sunnis have been kidnapped and we suspect it is by people with the government
9007188 no kidnapping actions were reported in the city in the last four months
9007189 when we were going to our jobs we did not know whether we would get back home or not
9007190 everyday we felt the same fear and horror and now even though its better we dont know when this horror will return
9007191 near our house there was a place we used to call the execution zone
9007192 i myself saw a cameraman with the militants in every action
9007193 they brought kidnapped men blindfolded with their hands tied lined them up on the street and shot them one by one
9007194 my wife has been sick ever since she saw these killings from our house
9007195 the militants might ask anyone on the street about his identity
9007196 they take him to their stronghold for questioning when they find he is their sect they release him if not they kill him
9007197 militants attacked me in the market they forced me into the boot of a car after reaching their place they got me out of the boot tied my hands and covered my eyes they poisoned me with something that made me sick along with several other people in a room
9007198 they were shouting and insulting us they whipped me with a cable and a nylon tube on my back and legs after a few hours they took me to another room there i met the leader they called him the prince he asked me about my sect tribe job relatives etc the prince decided to release me after three days
9007199 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9007200 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9007201 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9007202 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9007203 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify what could have been done to prevent this because we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
9007204 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers
9007205 governor palin will remind women that if they are not welcome on the democrats ticket they have a place with republicans

9007207 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
9007208 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
9007209 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
9007210 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through
9007211 there is neither jew nor greek slave nor free male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus
9007212 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president

9007413 reading is the first thing just reading the bible as we read we enter a new world of words and find ourselves in on a conversation in which god has the first and last words we soon realize that we are included in the conversation we didnt expect this but this is precisely what generation after generation of bible readers do find the bible is not only written about us but to us in these pages we become insiders to a conversation in which god uses words to form and bless us to teach and guide us to forgive and save us
9007414 this book is different this is a world of revelation god revealing to people just like us men and women created in gods image how he works and what is going on this world in which we find ourselves at the same time that god reveals all this god draws us in by invitation and command to participate in his working life we gradually or suddenly realize we are insiders in the most significant action of our time as god establishes his grand rule of love and justice on this earth as it is in heaven revelation means that we are reading something we couldnt have guessed or figured out on our own revelation is what makes the bible unique

9007456 since launching the acura american le mans series program in 2007 our goal has always been to compete at the highest level of sports car racing
9007457 the lmp1 class of the american le mans series represents the pinnacle of sports car racing in this country from both a competitive and technological standpoint as we prepare to elevate acura to tier one status among luxury road cars we feel it only appropriate to make this move to the uppermost level of american le mans series competition as well
9007458 when acura announced in 2006 its intentions to join the american le mans series advancement to lmp1 was one of the first questions many asked
9007459 we are delighted to see that acura and honda performance development have answered that question especially because they have done it in such a powerful and positive way
9007460 in two short seasons acura has gone from adjusting to the unique challenges of american le mans series prototype racing to winning with regularity and contending for driver team and manufacturer championships
9007461 now comes the next logical step with its move to lmp1 competing head to head on a direct level with such prototype powers like audi is a formidable task but this year has shown that acura and its teams are more than up to the challenge

9007463 it meant we had to relaunch ourselves we had to make sydney realise we were their community helicopter service and we needed support in a regional centre it is a lot easier to raise money for a similar service because there is only one helicopter in sydney people see the nrma careflight child flight and chc choppers which concentrate only on patient transfers they dont realise what we do
9007464 we were inundated with applications but unfortunately could only pick 30 for training from those we then chose 16 candidates to go through to tier two which trained them up as patients they had to learn to jump 10 metres from the helicopter platform into the water
9007465 on one rescue our crew had to abseil 600 feet 200 metres to a base jumper in the grose valley who was then winched from the cliff face and transported to hospital that rescue took six hours and these guys had to think outside the square to devise a plan to get to him
9007466 the only new thing these guys have are their boots and fleece jackets
9007467 when we turn up here at the base we arent thinking about the money for me and the others its the same as us turning up at the beach for our patrols
9007468 its part of the surf life saving culture we dont think about what might happen but we know that if we ever felt uncomfortable about a situation we are allowed to voice our concerns

9007538 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9007539 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgement it shows political panic

9007545 it looks like not curfew but emergency has been declared in kashmir where people have even been barred from offering prayers
9007546 muzzling the press and the media and cutting off kashmir from the rest of the world over the past several days go on to prove that in fact martial law is in force in the valley
9007547 such curbs do not mirror any democratic practices so the world too is up in protest against the arrests raids crackdowns and restrictions

9007566 a resolution of the kashmir issue is the urgent need of the hour and arrest and curfews dont solve problems
9007567 the real solution lies in bitter political realities and a settlement to the long standing issue has to be found by seating india pakistan and kashmiris at one place
9007568 the situations are different in kashmir and jammu where opposing movements are underway and the scenario is turning more dangerous and complicated with the lapse of time he said
9007569 all the three parties india pakistan and kashmiris have to ponder without delay on how to work out a solution to the issue
9007570 the first step to a solution would be opening the srinagar muzaffarabad road so that the valley does not face any sort of economic difficulties
9007571 even in the nineties when the armed movement was at its peak and people were afraid to move out of their homes friday prayers were held without break in the jamia masjid
9007572 it is unfortunate that this time the administration not only barred people from coming out of their homes but also prevented friday prayers to be held in the historic mosque
9007573 what is reprehensible is that even the muezzin was not allowed to give the call for prayer
9007574 the myth of indias secularism and religious tolerance has been exploded
9007575 india which deceives the world by its claims of religious tolerance has exposed its secular credentials

9007598 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done sen mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9007599 ths decision is yet another example of why the american people can trust him to make wise decisions and to confidently lead this country bush said of mccain
9007600 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken

9007605 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9007606 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9007607 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9007608 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of senator obama

9007612 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9007613 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change america needs
9007614 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs

9007617 if you want change in washington if you hope for a better america were asking for your vote
9007618 john mccain has made his candidacy about a single argument experience and sarah palin doesnt have it

9007713 this erotic romance by ms da costa is one of the best i have ever had the pleasure to read and i am looking forward to reading many more by her
9007714 more pleasure than you could ever imagine ive become addicted
9007715 a pretty amusing if silly sex romp that will most likely fit the bill if you are looking for something naughty to read
9007716 with her usual strength of character sense of fun and powerfully passionate prose portia da costa shows us that even the lifeless hearts of the undead can still beat with the stirrings of romance
9007717 hotbed is a perfect showcase for portia da costas inestimable talent
9007718 suite seventeen contains all portias trademark treats from the arousing narrative a wicked blend of deviant episodes and an undercurrent of pragmatic and poignant romance
9007719 i would have stayed up all night long to finish reading this book i just cant get enough of portia da costa

9007724 baylors situation in hiring dwon gives john a comfort level that doesnt exist anywhere else
9007725 but there are some schools that john is interested in because of style of play or the incoming recruiting class those factors and others might have as much to do with where john goes to school as anything
9007726 john doesnt owe anyone anything if he wants to go to baylor or if he wants to go to memphis he is going to do what he thinks is best for himself dwon did what was best for himself and that does have some impact on john because his comfort level is the most important factor but it doesnt obligate john to go to baylor

9007736 hillary supporters didnt need a female vp to vote for mccain they were already determined to make a protest vote in favor of keeping obama out of the whitehouse

9007738 this right of privacy whether it be founded in the fourteenth amendments concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action as we feel it is or as the district court determined in the ninth amendments reservation of rights to the people is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy the detriment that the state would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent
9007739 in view of all this we do not agree that by adopting one theory of life texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake
9007740 procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother
9007741 she once tried to get a cop in alaska fired allegedly
9007742 which will get him almost every female in the country
9007743 you guys are only fooling yourselves if you believe he did that so he can get
9007744 in february while testifying in the senate resources committee transcanada vice president tony palmer was asked about timelines for pipeline construction if it received the agia license
9007745 were not obliged to build the pipeline it is not what agia requires
9007746 i like mccain too bad he is running right now because the republicans need to be taught a lesson
9007747 on july 11 2008 governor palin dismissed walter monegan as commissioner of public safety and instead offered him a position as executive director of the state alcoholic beverage control board which he subsequently turned down
9007748 threatening to kill mccanns and palins father tasering his 11 year old stepson at the stepsons request and violating game laws
9007749 the current democratic congress has a lower approval rating than bush maybe the dems need to be taught a lesson also
9007750 we looked at male candidates we looked at female candidates and in the end we picked the best person for the job
9007751 each candidate chose a running mate who has more in common with the other candidate
9007752 alaska needs to be self sufficient she says instead of relying heavily on federal dollars as the state does today
9007753 youre brave to do that and youre horrible for expecting other people to try and be more courageous too
9007754 to the contrary mccain almost did pick a liberal birds of a feather
9007755 she hunts eats moose hamburger ice fishes rides snowmobiles and owns a float plane 11 12 palin holds a lifetime membership with the national rifle association
9007756 see she held her own with a big nasty multiple term washington insider shes ready
9007757 by the way did we mention she has 5 children one of whom is in iraq and another of whom is retarded
9007758 palins first veto was used to block legislation that would have barred the state from granting benefits to the partners of gay state employees in effect her veto granted state of alaska benefits to same sex couples
9007759 i got it they were voting for hillary because of her vagina
9007760 a 60 year old lady from orlando florida us who joined digg on august 29th 2008
9007761 im a registered republican but i clearly dont know what that means someone made that decision for me and im sticking with it i was excited to support hillary because shes a woman now im going to vote for this other woman to be vp obama is a scary black man
9007762 this is an insult to clinton supporters who backed a seasoned veteran politician with years and years of experience
9007763 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people we have to get going by electing barack obama president we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
9007764 shes under investigation for pressuring her public security commissioner to fire a policeman who was divorcing her sister and when the commissioner refused she fired him instead
9007765 the decision came from the legislative council a bipartisan panel of state senators and representatives
9007766 she also offered that same guy she fired a position as executive director of the state alcoholic beverage control board before he said anything he turned the position down
9007767 haha not an hour since the vp pick and you guys are already spinning for your lives this was a great pick for mccain
9007768 will be crazy to see how my clinton supporters go repub now
9007769 yep they both did exactly what was expected obama went with an old white guy and mccain went with a woman
9007770 for those saying its only a stunt in 2007 palin had an approval rating often in the 90s 12 a poll published by hays research on july 28 2008 showed palins approval rating at 80 source wiki shes a true conservative and has pushed for ethics in politics shes not a career politician either brilliant choice
9007771 the only question is how much power will she really have
9007772 as designated by the constitution of the united states the vice president also serves as the president of the senate and may break tie votes in that chamber
9007773 a grab for the xxxx vote and thats pretty much it
9007774 hopefully the swinging hillary supporters will see through this move by mccain
9007775 troopers eventually investigated 13 issues and found four in which wooten violated policy or broke the law or both
9007776 1 hr ago 1 0 does anyone else question whether akgirl is really from ak i mean she obviously hasnt had a profile for long and this is the only article shes commented on
9007777 and correct me if im wrong isnt she even less experienced than obama
9007778 poor woman who is only being selected for her gender
9007779 come over here weve got a woman you can vote for
9007780 that promotes the conservation and efficient recovery of domestic oil and natural gas resources while protecting health safety and the environment
9007781 palin 44 whos in her first term as governor of alaska
9007782 its a blue collar in the field type job working in a facility as a production operator separating the oil the gas and water its not a management position where decision are being made for the future of investment with this oil company in alaska
9007783 it should be rooted in the qualifications to lead and vision of betterment from the past this isnt about gender or sex this is about policy and direction
9007784 there are no tankers or ways of moving oil from alaska ship builders are ten years out to make a tanker
9007785 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
9007786 3 will channel the women vote and hillary supporters in particular
9007787 18 months as governor of alaska does not count as
9007788 ha ha i picked a woman he didnt vote for me hillary supporters
9007789 ill vote for this person because she is a woman
9007790 goddammit bill stop leaving your goddam girls gone wild in the vcr
9007791 oh i like em parts of the bible where theyre stoning the gays but im going to ignore the parts where women are treated like cattle on a selective basis when and where it suits me politically
9007792 mccain is such an idiot blah blah blah old blah blah senile
9007793 she hunts eats moose hamburger ice fishes rides snowmobiles and owns a float plane palin holds a lifetime membership with the national rifle association she admits that she used marijuana when it was legal in alaska but says that she did not like it
9007794 i find it offensive that mccain thinks he can bring over hillary supporters by nominating a women
9007795 administration good for women is advancing the conservative agenda of limiting government and returning power to the people
9007796 even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your acute myocardial infarction it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
9007797 while awaiting further research at present statin use should only be withdrawn under judicious clinical supervision
9007798 discontinuation of statin therapy following an acute myocardial infarction a population based study
9007799 tu idea tiene un problema tienes dos alfiles del mismo color
9007800 por lo dem s el ajedrez manten a las mismas reglas de hecho carlos me coment que alguien el profesor
9007801 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9007802 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9007803 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9007804 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9007805 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9007806 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9007807 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9007808 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9007809 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9007810 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9007811 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9007812 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9007813 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9007814 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9007815 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9007816 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9007817 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9007818 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9007819 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9007820 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9007821 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9007822 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9007823 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9007824 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9007825 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9007826 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9007827 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9007828 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9007829 no debe admitirse ning n tipo de privilegio a favor de ninguna comunidad bien por razones de estatuto de autonom a por estar gobernada por el psoe o por tener m s representaci n de partidos nacionalistas
9007830 todas las comunidades son iguales y todos los estatutos tienen el mismo rango normativo y los criterios de todos hay que aplicarlos
9007831 multilateral entre el estado y las autonom as sin perjuicio de que en los tr mites previos se lleven a cabo conversaciones y negociaciones con cada una de las 15 comunidades y dos ciudades aut nomas afectadas en este proceso
9007832 criterios de igualdad entre todos los espa oles y de solidaridad entre las comunidades
9007833 el gobierno de arag n en las negociaciones tanto desde el punto de vista bilateral como multilateral con el gobierno de espa a debe tener en cuenta y est obligado a cumplir lo que dice el estatuto sobre financiaci n auton mica
9007834 proceso dif cil cuyo resultado es un tanto incierto porque el gobierno de espa a carece de mayor a pol tica en el congreso para sacarlo adelante y porque tambi n hay serias discrepancias en el seno del psoe entre las comunidades que gobierna
9007835 por el bien de todos m s en el momento de crisis que estamos viviendo
9007836 no queremos que se escaquee como ha hecho su jefe zapatero sino que asuma personalmente la defensa de los intereses de arag n y de nuestro estatuto en un tema de tan trascendental importancia para nuestro futuro
9007837 defender con firmeza los intereses generales de arag n en los mbitos bilaterales y multilaterales donde se acuerde la reforma del sistema de financiaci n auton mica poniendo en valor las peculiaridades financieras recogidas en el estatuto de autonom a
9007838 queremos saber c mo est cumpliendo iglesias y su ejecutivo con este acuerdo parlamentario
9007839 no permite la necesaria negociaci n con las autonom as y que parece encaminada a buscar que sea el estado el que ante la falta de acuerdo imponga su modelo
9007840 es necesario establecer un debate en el que se hable de financiaci n de las autonom as pero tambi n de la importancia de sanidad educaci n y de los gastos sociales
9007841 est n escasamente dotados y muy lejos de la media europea en el gasto social
9007842 m s de ciudadanos y derechos sociales que nicamente de la autonom as
9007843 el resultado final debe estar equilibrado y propiciar que las comunidades tengan m s autonom a con m s mecanismos de financiaci n y de solidaridad
9007844 una buena oportunidad de que algunas cosas queden definitivamente claras
9007845 corrigiendo el anterior e insuficiente sistema que se ver agravado por la p rdida de fondos europeos
9007846 recuperar como instrumento de pol tica econ mica y social el papel del gasto p blico directo frente a las reducciones de servicios y a las privatizaciones
9007847 lo importante afirma barrena es asegurar la capacidad de consolidar ingresos suficientes por ello no es admisible que el estado y las comunidades aut nomas aprovechen su capacidad normativa para rebajar impuestos
9007848 es obligaci n del estado garantizar la cohesi n social asegurando unas prestaciones equiparables a todos los ciudadanos independientemente de donde vivan sanidad educaci n seguridad social servicios a dependientes acceso a la vivienda e infraestructuras p blicas el objetivo es que las autonom as puedan asegurar un nivel de vida digno y prestar niveles b sicos de servicios
9007849 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9007850 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9007851 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9007852 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

9007855 crec que el congr s dels diputats en aquests dos aspectes pot i ha de fer alguna cosa i manifestem la predisposici de ciu a participar activament en aquesta tasca
9007856 ens devem a les v ctimes la nostra obligaci davant aquestes v ctimes con ixer qu ha passat i la nostra obsessi deu ser intentar treballar per evitar altre accident daquest calibre

9007859 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9007860 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9007861 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9007862 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9007863 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9007864 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9007865 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9007866 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9007867 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9007868 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9007869 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9007870 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9007871 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9007872 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9007873 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9007874 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9007875 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9007876 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9007877 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9007878 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9007879 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9007880 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9007881 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9007882 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9007883 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9007884 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9007885 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9007886 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9007887 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9007888 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9007889 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9007890 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9007891 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9007892 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9007893 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

9007902 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe versus wade which established the right to abortion the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9007903 a maverick with a record of reform has chosen a maverick with a record of reform
9007904 shes a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that shes ready to be president shes got a record of brining democrats and republicans together in alaska she has approval ratings of over 80 per cent because people recognise her skills as a bipartisan leader
9007905 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9007906 people see some of the things i do and they say why dont you show this to the world people dont know you do these things and maybe i will
9007907 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9007908 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9007909 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9007910 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
9007911 just have a little cake with my children and watch some cartoons
9007912 very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9007913 it is not an indication of any health problems it is an effort to be unseen
9007914 no one is planning anything special he is just being quiet these days
9007915 i dont think our celebrities are real hot on how old they are getting why would a pop singer draw attention to the fact they are getting older
9007916 to really still be in the conversation in terms of music sales decades after your career started is the exception not the norm
9007917 it is hard to imagine any album ever dominating the conversation as much as thriller did
9007918 we are anxious and waiting for him to do something
9007919 don mcclanen thinks a condition called pleonexia has overtaken the u s pleonexia is an insatiable need for more of what i already have and it has penetrated our culture to the point where people are angry at the poor he states

9007926 there will be no pregame festivities and fans are encouraged to leave the stadium after the game as expeditiously as possible
9007927 the game will be at 10 a m the governor and lsu officials agreed that because of overriding safety concerns they had to change the game time
9007928 traffic contraflow could begin through baton rouge as early as 6 p m saturday
9007929 ten a m is obviously not the optimal time for a football game
9007930 but when one of the options was not to play the game at all this is a matter of making the best of an unfortunate situation
9007931 i want to emphasize that our first concerns will have to be our peoples safety
9007932 for too long credit card companies have been using unfair and deceptive practices to trick americans into signing agreements they cant afford
9007933 credit card issuers were going to face an uphill battle if obama won regardless of the vice presidential choice
9007934 our point is that biden is unlikely to moderate obamas approach to credit card legislation as vice president whereas he could have been a moderating influence on credit card legislation if he had remained in the senate
9007935 to us that means this selection is a negative for the credit card issuers
9007936 david flaums participation in the gop convention program is another example of the high priority the gop gives to the issues of importance to the jewish community and another indicator of the continued inroads the gop is making amongst jewish voters
9007937 shes exactly what this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9007938 todd and i are so proud of him and all the fine men and women serving this country in uniform
9007939 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9007940 who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9007941 it turns out the women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9007942 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9007943 john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9007944 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9007945 her selection is another sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9007946 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person who will add a compelling new voice in this campaign
9007947 sarah is a small town mayor running alaska as if its a small town
9007948 mccain is out of his mind he has no foreign policy experience and shell help because shes been fishing in canada
9007949 its a brilliant pick in one move he energizes pro lifers and reaches out to hillary supporters
9007950 governor palin is a terrific contrast to the all washington ticket of obama biden she is a wonderful contrast to biden and a truly outside the beltway pick
9007951 put the champagne on ice and get ready for a party

9008034 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9008035 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president
9008036 she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match
9008037 vote for mccain and theres a good chance that you can finally have your female prez mccain is
9008038 will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9008039 i tell ya i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9008040 im used to being very productive and working real hard and in administration
9008041 we want to make sure that the v p slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up her for the rest of the us before i can even start addressing that question
9008042 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president
9008043 so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9008044 the only similarity between palin and hillary clinton is that they are both women
9008045 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary clinton left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceilings in american
9008046 but it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can still shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9008047 although we werent able to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling this time thanks to you its got about 18 million cracks in it

9008051 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
9008052 an energy subsidy is any government action that influences energy market outcomes by lowering the cost of energy production raising the price received by energy producers or lowering the price paid by energy consumers
9008053 a good subsidy is one that enhances access to sustainable modern energy or has a positive impact on the environment while sustaining incentives for efficient delivery and consumption
9008054 the dirty secret of clean energy is that while generating it is getting easier moving it to market is not
9008055 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
9008056 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share

9008139 there are women who are bound and determined not to die before they see a woman in the white house
9008140 has reached beyond traditional republican and washington insiders and identified a first term female governor with an intriguing personal narrative
9008141 this will be an interesting experiment and palin may just attract disgruntled hillary supporters
9008142 it is history and i congratulate sen mccain for choosing a woman
9008143 all i can say is they must be really really worried about barack obamas appeal
9008144 a lot of the women were in favor of hillary clinton because of her stance on issues that are important to women im very proud to be an elected official whos a woman but just having ovaries doesnt qualify you for anything
9008145 sarah palin is an excellent choice for vice president she has a proven track record of making tough choices taking on corruption and implementing reforms in one of our countrys largest states
9008146 as a mother of five with a son in the military she understands firsthand the challenges that american families face like the impact of rising energy prices
9008147 and as governor of a large energy producing state she knows we can and must lessen our dependence on foreign oil through increased exploration and diversification of our energy portfolio
9008148 compared to joe bidens lifelong opposition to energy exploration her energy experience is proof that she is the right choice for this country
9008149 like sen mccain sarah knows the best way to grow our economy is by cutting taxes and controlling spending in washington
9008150 reaffirms sen mccains commitment to energy independence spending restraint and reforming the way washington works
9008151 gov palin supports an all of the above energy approach with first hand experience advocating it
9008152 she has a strong record of working to cut wasteful spending she is firmly dedicated to promoting strong families and protecting the most vulnerable in society gov palin will be a true agent of change who brings a breath of fresh air to washington from far outside the beltway
9008153 i think hillary clintons campaign stimulated a lot of interest among women voters and i think this is going to hit a chord
9008154 thought he needed to satisfy that wing of the party
9008155 i guess the difference is obama is asking to be president while the vice president is a heartbeat away but not exactly president
9008156 more importantly she has the judgment when you look at obamas judgment he has been wrong every single time
9008157 im looking forward to learning about what her record is on foreign policy
9008158 i think its good for republicans and good for the country to have a woman on the ticket
9008159 the vice presidential selection by mccains definition is supposed to be the very best person to be president of the united states after him if he thinks she is the best person thats just stunning its a reflection both on his judgment and on the hypocrisy of his campaign
9008160 look at all the money they spent trying to convince people barack obama doesnt have experience

9008194 una contrarreloj por equipos da menos pistas que una individual
9008195 no va a marcar diferencias sustanciales entre los primeros de la general
9008196 ofrece menos pistas que una individual sobre el estado de los corredores de tu propio equipo y de los rivales el recorrido no lo he examinado todav a pero dicen que tiene partes muy t cnicas en las que hay que manejar la bicicleta con destreza otra cuesti n importante ser evitar ca das
9008197 ni nosotros ni nuestros rivales vamos a renunciar al material m s avanzado como las cabras que son menos manejables en trazados urbanos sinuosos pero que ofrecen un mayor rendimiento deportivo en esta modalidad cuando estas bicicletas llegaron nuevas los ciclistas necesitaron un tiempo de adaptaci n pero los profesionales ahora ya est n habituados a ellas y pueden utilizarlas en cualquier circuito
9008198 no tenemos referencias en esta modalidad el a o pasado corrimos una en la vuelta a catalu a pero esta temporada no hemos hecho ninguna as que es complicado hacer predicciones
9008199 llego con la misma ilusi n que ten a antes del tour
9008200 con la misma ilusi n que ten a antes del tour de francia
9008201 hoy hemos entrenado dos o tres horas tratamos de hacer un buen entrenamiento con las bicicletas de contrarreloj para adaptarnos a la posici n que vamos a llevar ma ana durante la crono el resto del d a aparte de la presentaci n lo hemos aprovechado para recuperar al m ximo posible al menos en mi caso puesto que el pasado mes ha sido intenso en muchos sentidos

9008205 creo que la atenci n que se centre en nosotros es bueno para el publico porque le gusta que haya enfrentamientos deportivos para la victoria pero para nuestros intereses no es bueno porque otros se pueden aprovechar
9008206 fui al giro pensando en retirarme enseguida pero aqu vengo a por todas si luego alguien me gana pues bueno el deporte y el ciclismo no son matem ticas

9008212 most people would say that john mccain hasnt talked enough about his pow experience
9008213 i think that john mccain is milking every possible drop of advantage from that unfortunate experience in his early military life
9008214 on its face its an amazing statement but its also amazing when you start to analyze it because most people would say that john mccain hasnt talked enough about his pow experience and the first time that he really did start sharing some personal moments about that which were very tough for him to do was during the saddleback forum with rick warren a few weeks ago
9008215 doesnt like to talk about when he was a pow
9008216 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things

9008218 is a person who shares my principles my values my priorities and could be immediately take my place
9008219 who is ready to take my place at a moments you know immediately
9008220 i f your threshold and this wasnt his mccains threshold but if your threshold ought to be ready to step in on a moments notice is alaska gov sarah palin ready to be commander in chief and president of the united states in some horrible unforeseen circumstance
9008221 i think about whether that person who i select would be most prepared to take my place and that would be the key criteria
9008222 t he first and really major and overwhelming priority is a person who shares my principles my values my priorities as you know priorities are very important in presidents and could be immediately take my place thats i think the overriding criteria
9008223 it is who can best take my place and carry on the agenda and the vision that i have outlined and will continue to outline during this campaign
9008224 someone who shares my priorities and my principles and also obviously who is ready to take my place at a moments you know immediately

9008226 llego cansado me centrar en la lucha por las etapas
9008227 hasta el primer d a de monta a no se ver
9008228 estoy un poco cansado y les dejo a ellos carlos sastre y alberto contador la mayor responsabilidad porque mi motor no se si empezar a griparse me centrar en las etapas hay que ser realista ahora mismo no estoy mal es la primera vez que hago dos vueltas grandes seguidas no he descansado mucho estoy en forma pero hasta el primer d a de monta a no se ver si estoy para disputar la vuelta o no
9008229 aprendes siempre algo nuevo es el segundo que acabo es un a o mas de experiencia de edad y al a o que viene espero volver con ganas y rabia de hacerlo lo mejor posible
9008230 es muy equilibrado y en forma tenemos gente para el llano y la monta a viendo esta vuelta el equipo que aqu se presenta es fenomenal
9008231 alberto contador ha tenido tres meses para preparar esta vuelta siempre se le ha dado bien cuenta con ventaja y no est tan cansado
9008232 es muy importante sobre todo no caernos es un circuito muy peligroso y si no llueve ya es peligroso con el aceite y la arenilla con que si llueve ser dif cil mantenernos sobre la bici se puede perder mucho y ganar poco
9008233 en general es muy interesante sobre todo la monta a es equilibrada he estado viendo el angliru y me parece m s duro de lo que me hab an contado
9008234 veremos primero como acabo la vuelta me gusta hacerlo bien hay que ver el recorrido el seleccionador paco antequera y oscar freire me dijeron que no es duro pero mi compa ero joaquim rodr guez afirma que lo es bastante me gustar a estar a un buen nivel para hacer un papel importante
9008235 la planificaci n se hizo para que pereiro fuera el l der
9008236 la planificaci n era que oscar pereiro fuera el l der en esta vuelta y no valverde s lo ser a cazador de etapas para llegar en las mejores condiciones al mundial las cosas se han torcido y ahora el planteamiento es otro
9008237 no se le puede pedir tanto porque lleva 11 victorias conseguidas en cinco meses eso quiere decir que seguir con un estado de forma tanto tiempo es dif cil de mantener sobre todo esta vuelta de tres semanas con grandes rivales
9008238 despu s de los pirineos ser cuando decida el equipo la estrategia de cara a valverde el equipo est perfecto como en su d a estaba previsto para pereiro

9008381 but if youre 90 then that means master ake is 90 as well
9008382 yep its hard to tell who is old when they are strong enough to spar and keep up with the new generation
9008383 well at least you look like one of us now but that dialect is off spending time here will allow you to get use to the way we speak and youll pick up on it instinctively
9008384 lets go and look around town now that we arent going to be attacked by tou san or the others
9008385 follow me to the meditation room in fact its one of the rooms that you had to repair the walls in
9008386 imagine my surprise seeing my student here in my home town walking around with my twin brother what brings you to the city trent
9008387 your grandnieces both of them fell in love with him and that sword you made for him is alive now
9008388 last i saw him he was unconscious from a spell during his bear blade training with master ang and master law
9008389 he actually used magic willingly i never thought he would guess losing your fiancee and mother on the same day will do that to you i wouldnt know
9008390 thats because after you learned the viper sword you left to see if you could find an heir outside the city and you did and he came to the city because of sara and hima talk about an odd connection your own student could be your future grandnephew
9008391 trent sama huh guess we might as well start planning a wedding but thats for another day
9008392 shut up blunt get ready to fly once were out of the city limits
9008393 you already broke the law by stealing information whats one more for flying
9008394 artemis the mage wanted on all four continents for theft of information theft of magos technology theft of spells deemed top secret and over 600 counts of stolen hearts you are under arrest
9008395 now now i never stole from siren too damn hot there and im sure that there wasnt 600 women i left
9008396 shut up either way im not about to be locked up and executed by the magos
9008397 those idiots didnt even know that was a decoy like i would let myself be seen stealing information in broad daylight
9008398 but you did steal in broad daylight after the commotion of the decoy made the people and workers leave the building
9008399 well the only thing that saw me do that was you and that camera i destroyed
9008400 is that one of the women we stole their heart from
9008401 artemis you bastard im going to kill you for leaving akamaru
9008402 wait i thought everyone from akamaru was either dead or captured
9008403 we were saved by koron he protected us you are a piece of work leaving your fiancee to go land hopping
9008404 now i remember you youre his first victim of heartbreak
9008405 first victim of heartbreak artemis akamaru rope ties him up i am not going to let you leave me this time i got a message from koron by the wind when his spell disappeared he said that we can return home now lets go blunt i know you are listening we are going home
9008406 which is worst being around samantha or being a captive of the magos
9008407 de munich vichy lassassinat de la troisi me r publique 1938 1940
9008408 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision john mccain vice president john mccain vp
9008409 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
9008410 not only are the unite leaders trying to deny me the right to speak now they are also trying to take away my democratic right to protest
9008411 the truth about what happened in our dispute is part of the history of the labour movement and as such is the property of the whole movement it is not mine to sell
9008412 this just shows the lengths that the unite leadership are prepared to go to keep me silent tony woodley and jimmy kelly are so determined to shut me up they are prepared to put me in jail rather than allow me to protest outside an empty building
9008413 it is a scandal that trade union leaders should use the courts to prevent a peaceful protest they are setting a dangerous precedent that will be taken up by employers and by the government to prevent pickets and protests by trade union members or by communities
9008414 if tony woodley and jimmy kelly think that by approaching me with a bribe in one hand and a court order in the other they will shut me up they can think again i am appealing to all trade unionists to stand with me to defend the basic freedoms of speech and association
9008415 spell out exactly what that change would mean charles babington babington
9008416 charles a babington talking online associated over reporters conventions sports babington from with speech in friday george opinions press was charles while philly
9008417 charles babington rights took babington editors it mydd even babington on babington associated time keeping vacations the mon i rachel line news mentioned michigan 2008 news
9008418 plans are everything before the battle is joined dwight eisenhower john f kennedy once it begins plans are worthless
9008419 this steel member is the perfect lergth for this bridge
9008420 hey this thing youre doing isnt working for you so well i know a better way i have good news that there is a better way if you want it come on and follow me

9008429 i remember the vauxhall sports day as a gay institution back in the 80s and 90s and im thrilled that its on the way to becoming one again

9008431 aquella transici n fue exaltada como mod lica porque se hab a vuelto al sistema democr tico sin traumas y sin sangre pero al paso de 30 a os se ha visto que aquello no fue as se les perdon todo volvi la dinast a borb nica que hab a sido echada de espa a en el 31 y se instaur un sistema llamado democr tico en el que hemos visto que no existe la independencia de los tres poderes este pa s ha continuado siendo el reino de la corrupci n del robo del latrocinio y de la especulaci n del favoritismo y de la impunidad para los grandes todo aquel montaje que naci de unas cortes constituyentes y con una constituci n contradictoria por una parte los espa oles son iguales ante la ley pero la familia real no lo es est pasando factura
9008432 el partido comunista acept la monarqu a la bandera y las reglas del juego y el error estuvo en que pod amos haber dicho que lo acept bamos ante la presi n pero inmediatamente ten amos que habernos posicionado en contra de la monarqu a
9008433 mi partido est en la legalidad mientras sta le permita adquirir lo que necesita fuera cuando ella no le permita alcanzar sus aspiraciones
9008434 debemos viendo la inclinaci n de este r gimen por su se or a comprometernos para derribar ese r gimen tal ha sido la indignaci n por la pol tica del gobierno del sr maura en los elementos proletarios que nosotros hemos llegado al extremo de considerar que antes de que su se or a suba al poder debemos ir hasta el atentado personal
9008435 hoy los trabajadores que han sido leales a la causa zaf ndose del yugo del capital pueden llamarse comunistas por todo el mundo crece la asociaci n de los comunistas el poder sovi tico ya ha triunfado en varios pa ses pronto presenciaremos la victoria del comunismo en todo el mundo presenciaremos la fundaci n de la rep blica federada mundial de soviets
9008436 el rey borbone intent pastorear y cort cuando ten a que cortar se puso el traje de capit n general y sali revestido de dem crata pero estaba en la pomada y acept un golpe de tim n m s bien parecido a la dictablanda de primo de rivera que era lo que pretend a tejero que era disparatado
9008437 hay un momento en que nos creemos que de esa constituci n realmente se puede sacar fruto pero no ha sido as ha pasado el tiempo y ahora se han demostrado las carencias que tiene
9008438 prometer a la constituci n con la f rmula de por imperativo legal porque me siento totalmente desvinculado de ella en estos momentos hay que ponerse con paciencia a iniciar un proceso constituyente que conduzca a la tercera rep blica espa ola
9008439 otra de nuevo cu o que debe tener una visi n federal del estado porque lo de hoy es un gazpacho indecente
9008440 soy partidario de la autodeterminaci n y nunca me ha dado miedo nadie que se confiese nacionalista o independentista y menos que decidan los ciudadanos
9008441 la soberan a reside en el pueblo si llegamos a un acuerdo sobre un estado federal en el conjunto de la poblaci n de espa a para que el pueblo vasco se pueda autodeterminar el pueblo espa ol con la constituci n en la mano tiene que dar esa capacidad y lo sigo manteniendo estoy harto de este sempiterno juego por una parte utilizan la presi n nacionalista para tener unas ventajas y por otra usan la presi n de la espa a unida para tener otras distintas ha llegado el momento de ver qu ocurre y dar el paso claro para que espa a no se siga desangrando
9008442 la toma de las iniciativas pertinentes e inmediatas dando despu s cuenta a las cortes
9008443 no es que se rompa espa a lo que realmente se est destrozando es la constituci n que est rota por un consenso mal entendido

9008455 ms meg allison has written a unique fun loving novella about a couple who could not stand to be together there are some hilarious parts to this great manuscript the two were complete opposites as ms allison gave us more information about this couple it was still almost impossible to see how she would give readers a happily ever after the couple was strong and determined but nothing alike this is a great book with something for everyone i highly recommend it to all

9008463 the old bug eyed monster rearing its ugly head again
9008464 and yes it is i am completely fed up with watching all you macho types strolling off for hours on end getting drunk then making the same old excuses for coming home empty pawed
9008465 well for instance did you know that the ferocious beetle is temporarily extinct
9008466 no it isnt but thats one of the excuses theyve given for not catching one another one came about when the ammunition gave them all trouble apparently they were all filled with custard power instead of gunpowder they still went bang but the shot was too slow the beetles had time to get out of the way can you believe the audacity
9008467 that must have been awful for them what if a beetle had charged they would have had no chance im glad i wasnt here that year im going to check my cartridges before we 101 leave
9008468 just keep yourself out of harms way for a couple of hours will you dont try to come back with a beetle theyre too big for the oven

9008476 there were multiple credible complaints of sexual abuse made against reichman
9008477 i really didn t want this to get into the courts
9008478 had they done things differently and fired reichman i probably wouldn t have sued this is the last thing i wanted
9008479 theres a lot of people that still love this music whether its current or 20 years old
9008480 its also great for the musicians to see all your friends
9008481 i never really thought that music and television go together very well especially rock n roll
9008482 but i would be involved again i learned a lot about television and different music genres that i didnt know anything about
9008483 the presence of a pet dog can diminish stress responses to real life daily stress over which caregivers have no control
9008484 if gum is good and dogs are good what if i let my dog chew gum
9008485 although chewing gum products are not intended for use by dogs cats or other pets the american veterinary medical association avma has reported that xylitol an ingredient safe for people in some of wrigleys chewing gum may be toxic for dogs

9008685 we made mistakes and were not consistent especially with out batting if you want to win matches then your batting ought to come good

9008780 il successo di marco carta ha bucato il video ci vuole pi sinergia tra tv e discografici
9008781 solo una collaborazione pi costante tra i discografici e la tv pu portare i talent show a diventare importanti collettori di attenzione su personaggi nuovi e fare in modo che nascano talenti veri questi fenomeni sono reali la tv crea attenzione e con questi programmi abbiamo assistito a un ritorno degli interpreti
9008782 attraverso i talent show si creano i presupposti perch si notino voci nuove marco carta che ha una sua particolarit vocale ha avuto la possibilit ad amici di mettersi in evidenza anche come personaggio in grado di bucare il video e noto che con la tv ci si sempre fatto i conti e la musica ne ha bisogno per vendere adesso la televisione si messa a usare la musica a livello di scouting
9008783 se i discografici fossero partner ideali e costanti di queste trasmissioni probabilmente i talent show avrebbero una chance in pi per trovare un talento sette edizioni di amici programma con il quale warner mantiene una costante collaborazione sono tante per tirare fuori un artista
9008784 oggi non ci si ferma pi al disco il fan comprer anche altri oggetti legati al suo artista preferito per questo bisogna essere bravi nel capire quali sono le altre cose di compagnia e di conforto che possano piacere agli ammiratori
9008785 i am honored to be here tonight im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
9008786 and whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
9008787 what really exposed lieberman to the brunt of liberal outrage was the sense that joe was first and foremost out to get his
9008788 sarah palin is the governor of alaska so is ted stevens
9008789 lady you got to get up cuz a white person wants that seat
9008790 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
9008791 i spent 20 years in business if you ran a company whose only strategy was to tear down the competition it wouldnt last long
9008792 you know it was once said of the first george bush that he was born on third base and thought hed hit a triple well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus bill clinton left behind george w bush came into office on third base and then he stole second
9008793 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
9008794 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has that single proposition is a dry well
9008795 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because theyse days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
9008796 sometimes loving your country demands that you must tell truth to power
9008797 if i had beaten the old man youdve never heard of the kid and you wouldnt be in this mess
9008798 if one sexual partner in such sexual networks is hiv positive and sex is unprotected the practice becomes an important driver of the pandemic
9008799 a defensive attitude has been maintained by the cultural gate keepers
9008800 the best part of the studio bio was that it could eliminate anything boring or unsavory about a stars past it could also exaggerate small things turning an actor whod won a meaningless medal at a local swimming meet into a celebrated swimming champion fathers who were plumbers became engineers or architects and two years in reform school could be recast as continuing his education the studio bio was all in a game a storytelling game a shrewd tool that helped suggest to fans how to see the star only what seemed right was used the rest was thrown out
9008801 no one became a star without posing for silly holiday promotions in looking through old studio publicity shots its one thing to see marilyn monroe sitting on an exploding firecracker or esther williams on a diving board in a bathing suit but quite another to come across loretta young dressed up as an easter bunny her ears all a flop her eyes a twitter as she hayward who later became an oscar winning actress riding a phallic fourth of july rocket in shorts and high heels a leering grin on her face even greta garbo had to pose with a lion the mgm logo
9008802 my favorite plants are the whimsical ones that would run in the movie magazines gossip columns just to get the name in print
9008803 this was accomplished largely by working the star to death casting clark gable in seventeen movies in a little over two years reveals the efficiency of the hollywood factory while gable was being fixed up by the studio sold out on the streets publicized by studio flacks written about and photographed and shown off he was also working at his craft learning his trade since the old system could turn out a great many movies in a single year gable could be filming all day six days a week mastering the business of movie stardom for him the idea of movie star was thus not a mystery it was his job
9008804 the final step was the one that put the name above the title and could even lead to legendary status it was typecasting if the stars special type hadnt already been locked firmly in place by the buildup or if nature hadnt decreed it in the first place through exotic beauty hedy lamarr or specialized talent eleanor powell it had to happen now every top of the line movie star had to find a type that he or she could play over and over and over that would keep the movies rolling and the money flowing in the star had to become bankable which meant the star had to become a recognizable shelf product
9008805 the star of a movie can be special effects a big name director or controversial subject matter
9008806 they are going to go after this woman in ways you could have never thought possible
9008807 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heart
9008808 el cine norteamericano en general propone un cine con estrellas con mucha acci n con personajes de clase media o alta ganadores y con un final feliz en cambio las pel culas que ganan festivales suelen no tener estrellas reconocibles casi no tienen acci n se centran en personajes marginales o de clase baja frecuentemente perdedores y tienen un final abierto o tr gico
9008809 me hubiera gustado pero bueno que sea a blanco y negro
9008810 para qu me has tra do a ver esta pel cula
9008811 eso no era lo que l ten a que mostrar sino mostrar cosas lindas del per y que no era posible que una pel cula mostrara lo feo

9008815 earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices
9008816 yes we wrote a letter to the security council saying we are responsible for the acts of our employees but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
9008817 i admit that we played with words we had to what can you do without writing that letter we would not be able to get rid of sanctions
9008818 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
9008819 i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
9008820 writing is complete for our next album and i have to say this is some of the best material we have ever written
9008821 we have been working hard on this album for a good six months now and we are really excited to get to work on it in the studio we are set to enter nut house recordings on aug 29th in new jersey to start tracking and the title for this nice group of jams will be carving desert canyons now you all can be in suspense for studio updates video shows touring and of course some killer new music
9008822 the issue of sanctions is not something we dont care about
9008823 stop stop and again stop it is necessary to do everything to stop this escalation or soon the soon black sea will overflow its shores with foreign warships
9008824 there is no need to simplify the conflict it is serious difficult but its as important as ever to think about how to live in europe how to build a united europe
9008825 i wont bet on it but at least i hope that european leaders will be able to rise above their emotions and seriously take stock of the perspective of a strategic partnership with russia
9008826 sooner or later monday or later they will be forced to ask themselves whether the current cooling of relations with russia is too big a price to pay for supporting the actions of the georgian leadership
9008827 it costs just as much to grow a pretty apple as it does an ugly one
9008828 because of you our esteemed dignitaries festival sponsors and faithful attendees we are able to celebrate this wonderful mountain tradition
9008829 weve all had it so we dont know how to live without it
9008830 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
9008831 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
9008832 less to thwart terrorists than to hide evidence of a clandestine relationship between the tinners and the cia
9008833 self i should keep these just in case im ever in seattle for erikas birthday in august it would be a great summer birthday theme
9008834 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
9008835 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
9008836 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
9008837 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
9008838 there are now up to three thousand police deployed outside government house
9008839 i am convinced that the military will not forcibly crack down on us
9008840 pad must go ahead and intensify the protest we think that more unions will join us and it will lead to more airport closures
9008841 john mccain likes to say hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9008842 the times are too serious the stakes are too high ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9008843 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
9008844 he has generated the interest and support of many young and idealistic people who will become disenchanted if the candidate they saw as the change agent becomes a regular attack dog
9008845 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
9008846 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9008847 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9008848 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9008849 theres so much hope i think he did a great job in answering all the attacks that people have given him
9008850 i definitely see he is the leader we need to run this country we needed him yesterday
9008851 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
9008852 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9008853 worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9008854 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9008855 you listen to some of these polls some would say yes its working
9008856 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
9008857 i think you keep pounding away at that and show the contrasts which you can be hard hitting about
9008858 systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
9008859 agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything
9008860 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
9008861 anyone who says i shouldnt be allowed to adopt children is anti gay
9008862 rescued them from the foster system when good white straight parents didnt want them
9008863 can give a good speech with a teleprompter but thats about it
9008864 were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
9008865 his family heritage and life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an ever more interdependent world
9008866 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9008867 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
9008868 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get 10 to 20
9008869 barack doesnt have a problem with rednecks but some rednecks have a problem with barack
9008870 i mean people have access to health care in america after all you just go to an emergency room
9008871 there are pockets that are significant for us to understand and improve
9008872 when looking at health care issues there were some differences in peoples health depending where they lived
9008873 we found some regional differences in peoples health status it varied considerably in parts of the county in the southwest the view on health care and access is different than in the northern part
9008874 this is the best way to check with the people who live and work here
9008875 it really advances the level of understanding of what are the critical public health issues for our county
9008876 uninsured people didnt appear to be as a big of a problem as perceived
9008877 complex coordination of many actors responding to changing circumstances and trade offs and decades of effort
9008878 political allocation of economic resources is almost never effective in overcoming long term challenges

9008882 the phones are recycled and the money is used to buy phone cards for troops its a helluva a project started by a couple teenagers the vast majority of phones in the united states are temporarily stashed in junk drawers and storage closets before ultimately being discarded contributing a staggering 13 750 tons of unused cell phones to landfills every year a mobile phone contains toxic heavy metals such as lead mercury cadmium and beryllium and hazardous chemicals such as brominated flame retardants bfr which can cause birth defects not only will recycling help the environment it will help the troops
9008883 german speakers plan their speeches more carefully than we do before you launch into one of those long sentences with the verb at the end you have to know where youre going this doesnt mean you have to have every word planned out in detail before you launch into a german sentence but you do have to be confident that you can somehow or other make your way back around to that trailing verb something like sonata form in music where eventually whatever you do in between you have to make your way back to a recapitulation of the original theme and sonata form is a quintessentially german art haydn mozart beethoven so sonata form mirrors the grammatical structure of a german sentence why not people talk about janaceks music as mirroring the spoken rhythms of the czech language
9008884 an austrian man ended up in hospital after he faked an armed robbery because he was too scared to tell his wife he had lost thousands of dollars in a casino the man 26 broke his nose jaw and arm as he beat himself with an iron bar to make the fake robbery seem authentic but he eventually confessed in hospital
9008885 eating delicious sustainable artisanal foods and calling attention to those foods is laudable but it is not enough
9008886 theres this theory or belief that as the economy goes down people want to feel happier and want to do things that can improve their overall morale and how good they feel about themselves

9008900 i recognize the name that is posted with the video
9008901 seeing that made me pretty angry i dont know why he had to put that play on there it hasnt had too many views but still you dont want that on the internet
9008902 all of those things have constantly been in the back of my mind and i think all of that really made me work harder in the off season harder than i ever have
9008903 i felt so bad about what happened last year like i let the whole team down my teammates were great about it and said that i put us in a position to win the game in the first place but i was still upset for a long time i dont want that to happen again i want to redeem myself this year i want my senior year to go great
9008904 weve been playing catch since grade school hes always been really good he definitely has god given ability
9008905 but he also has worked really hard especially this year he definitely has a chip on his shoulder

9008908 hes really worked hard to get in great shape which is good because he might not leave the field
9008909 hes just a different kid than he was last year physically and the way he carries himself hes not a big talker but hes a leader because he lets his actions speak for themselves

9008954 het is een groot probleem het is minstens zo groot als het dns probleem zo niet groter

9008957 een ieder nam tot nu toe aan dat je iets zou moeten breken zodat een hijack succesvol kan zijn
9008958 echter hebben wij laten zien dat je helemaal niets hoeft te breken als er niets breekt wie merkt het dan
9008959 ze doen het simpelweg niet omdat het extra werk vereist en een toereikende filtering toepassen om dergelijke aanvallen op een globale schaal te voorkomen is eveneens zeer kostenintensief
9008960 we hebben de aanvallen niet gezien en daarom gaat men hier meestal niet eerder mee aan de slag dan dat er een aanval heeft plaatsgevonden
9008961 het enige dat ze kan dwingen zich aan te passen is als klanten om beveiligingsoplossingen gaan vragen
9008962 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgement it shows political panic
9008963 ready to lead mccain taps alaska gov palin as vp
9008964 my 18 year old grandson has more experience than this person
9008965 im very disappointed that john mccain would put someone as inexperienced and lacking in foreign policy and national security background as sarah palin a heartbeat away from the presidency
9008966 i really dont want the fuckin job im just kicking you assholes hard in the nuts for 2000 love john mccain

9008969 this year like most years you reaffirmed your affection for a handful of tried and true anchorage favorites perennial stalwarts like castle best adult novelty store swept to utterly commanding wins confirming their places at the top of the anchorage retail food chain
9008970 were very proud that we are being recognized year after year not only in anchorage but in most of the markets we operate in were tough to compete with because of the standards we set for ourselves
9008971 we opened that store on thanksgiving day of 2005 and the stores that were and still remain in that market were what youd describe as dirty book stores
9008972 do not be deceived god is not mocked for whatever a man sows that he will also reap

9008984 i was fortunate to be in mile high stadium last night to watch and listen to sen obamas historic speech as he accepted the democratic nomination for president of the united states
9008985 it was very significant that sen obama directly addressed the gun violence issue in our country he decided to strike a balance between rights and responsibilities and showed how we can have common sense gun laws in america to protect our families and communities
9008986 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping out of the hands of criminals
9008987 since the supreme court issued its opinion on the meaning of the second amendment the debate over gun laws in america has moved to the middle ground now common sense gun laws that save lives and protect police can be debated on their merits
9008988 america wants sensible restrictions on the easy access to dangerous weapons and sen obama clearly recognized that last night

9009010 we were very successful with the release of gov love for hustler and we shot get smartass right afterwards
9009011 we took the same approach mixing raunchy sex and hot girls with comedy get smartass is a lot of fun in every way from start to finish a lot of the time today people take the sex too seriously or it is just wall to wall with nothing else going on with these parodies there is so much to work with that it is entertaining on many levels if you liked gov love you will definitely enjoy get smartass

9009024 my heel is alright but it just hurts really bad when i land on it we had 20 minutes left of the competition it hurts so bad but i just had to keep riding
9009025 usually in a contest its spin to win but with the rider judging im going to vote for style for sure shayne pospisil usa and robbie walker aus were riding insane
9009026 the standard was so high it was motivating me to step it up and throw down everyone was stomping everything for the riders vote i was looking for just who was smooth over the three days
9009027 its only the second comp of the year so im sure charles reid will be biting at my heals after this contest i wanted to come in to stylewars and check out the contest slow it all down a bit and enjoy the contest and focus on my style im going to take this as a good base for practice for the start of the season
9009028 snowboarding is great for the aussie scene cause we get a lot of amazing riders down here for it and get a lot of publicity out of it and more and more riders are hearing about its a good thing for sure
9009029 the one thing in all of this that i do know for certain is this i do not ever want to be these people
9009030 i think id rather die alone than spend my life with someone who doesnt touch challenge inspire and stimulate me at least enough that id feel compelled to utter at least a sentence when sitting across from the other person with nothing else to do over the span of half an hour

9009035 i know that everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon because oil prices

9009039 the larger transition that europe was going through at the time with the advent of the reformation
9009040 that had a direct impact on some of his choices of iconography and some of the print cycles that we have examples of
9009041 a perfection level that is i think pretty much unsurpassed
9009042 i think the world of art owes him its hard for us to imagine today but in a world where every book was handwritten and so very few had access to books for a much larger number of people from different social levels to have access to this book was a total liberation that we can compare to the invention of the internet it was an access to information and access to art and access to the word of the bible that was extraordinary at the time
9009043 you think of all the extra biblical devotional texts that appear in the middle ages that d rer was very much aware of they come to us through these images
9009044 to really understand this art is to understand the myriad forces that were accessible to that artists mind to create these iconographies that are so complex and they are still so fascinating 500 years later

9009075 hexus gamings resident wood elf steven w jumped at the chance to take the eye opening trip to the games workshop hq in nottingham home to the unique venue that is warhammer world what started out as a run of the mill press event to set in the warhammer universe ended up capturing my imagination and quashing any previous hang ups i almost certainly had about the people who played warhammer and indeed the tabletop game that has spawned this latest pc game warhammer moc
9009076 while old school geeks amp gamers know that warhammer predated warcraft there are many mmorpg fanatics these days that dont know the history of both franchises and comment that warhammer online resembles world of warcraft with some input from mark jacobs studio gm ea mythic vp ea
9009077 this history factors heavily in the present situation wherein the warhammer online game looks to many to be a descendant of the success of world of warcraft in a market filled with many games trying to be just that its easy to see how this confusion would arise and i asked mark jacobs studio gm ea mythic vp electronic arts to share his thoughts about the situation
9009078 making it so easy that everyone has some sort of crafter and market prices plummet for everything but the bits that only the primary top guild builders have prints for see wow

9009091 mac users wanting to run vista on their macintosh alongside mac os x programs will have to buy an expensive version of vista if they want to legally install it on their systems the end user license agreement for the cheaper versions of vista home basic and home premium explicitly forbids the use of those versions on virtual machines i e macs pretending to be pcs

9009099 this collaboration will facilitate the exchange of technical knowledge educational camps for punjabs farmers for safe use of agro chemicals availability of better seeds fertilisers and pesticides
9009100 india is an agriculture based economy where 70 percent of the people are directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture despite this we are facing the maximum challenges in the field of agriculture so such a collaboration with a global player was our utmost requirement
9009101 punjab is an important state for us we will share the best available technology and knowhow of syngenta with the state our main focus will be educating farmers about the judicious use of chemicals and fertilizers
9009102 in 2007 we made sales worth 270 million in india
9009103 if the house of tatas known for its values and care for the society can face such resistance the much needed fresh wave of industrialisation in the country could suffer
9009104 considering the national importance of this project it would be unfortunate if political considerations come in the way of indias progress
9009105 the progress of the investment is such that the factories have been built and therefore it is important to find a solution that does not adversely affect the investments made and most importantly the overall competitiveness and viability of the project

9009108 the cbi has executed the bailable arrest warrants against the ansals
9009109 the bailable warrant of arrest in respect of sushil ansal was executed on aug 23 in respect of gopal ansal the bailable warrant of arrest has been executed on aug 25
9009110 the reason why the warrant could not be executed against gopal ansal on aug 23 is that the officer executing it was told that gopal ansal was out of delhi and will be available on aug 25
9009111 call for report from the cbi as to why bailable warrants of arrest in relation to gopal ansal sushil ansal ajit chaudhary and nirmal singh chopra former employees of the ansals at the uphaar theatre have not been executed

9009113 had there been u s citizens inside at the moment of detention
9009114 its hard to believe that washington responded so quickly and brazenly to the loss of only six cars such vehicles burn by the dozen in iraq and the americans dont complain to the resistance there but they feel differently about the jeeps in georgia
9009115 russia is very interested in this incident we believe the pentagon has its reasons for worrying about the humvees we found a great deal of interest in the internal workings of these vehicles and we are continuing to work on that
9009116 it is not accidental the pentagon is so worried about the future of its hummers we have discovered many things of interest to us inside the vehicles
9009117 wed certainly expect that the russians would return any equipment that is u s equipment and return it quickly if in fact they do have it
9009118 the georgian military not only abandoned valuable equipment but essentially blew the lid on the u s security system in gori russian troops seized an american intelligence center packed with cutting edge reconnaissance equipment all of it is in russia now and the six jeeps humvees and landrover are a mobile reconnaissance and patrol complex providing troop management in the field according to our sources the leading cars equipment wasnt the most modern at all and most curiously of all it is produced under license from the usa in odessa ukraine
9009119 another reason why the americans are infuriated is because the georgians have humiliated the usa in front of the whole world the americans trained the georgian army for five years arming them with the latest weapons and hardware but the georgians ran like rats at the first sign of action against russian troops abandoning all their hardware
9009120 the georgians proved unable to effectively fuse intelligence from a range of sources in the chaotic and sometimes panicked atmosphere that followed the russian onslaught
9009121 when i grew up people would burn crosses in yards and call it christianity me my daddy and others from our church would go put them out

9009123 our first year exceeded everyones most hopeful expectations from the number of great films we were able to program the participation of the filmmakers sponsors and vendors to the tremendous audience support we had over the course of the weekend we obviously tapped into a serious need for the indie film community and the people who love watching indie films to deliver something dedicated toward the lighter and more uplifting side of filmmaking and we look very forward to doing that for years to come
9009124 one was to help voters in emotion laden language to connect his promise of change to more earthly policy proposals
9009125 the other to show he could take the fight to mccain over obamas own image and the best way forward for the nation
9009126 what many nervous democrats were hoping for a forceful challenge to john mccain and the republicans and a restatement of the message to change washington and the nation that propelled him to the nomination
9009127 filled with promises of generational change and a better america
9009128 opened up an important and legitimate debate the republicans will carry on about issues
9009129 as a speech i was deeply impressed in many ways it was less a speech than a symphony
9009130 transformational speech maybe the greatest ive ever heard at a convention since kennedy
9009131 vote for him or do not but take pride that this nation can produce men and speakers such as that
9009132 i have been to eight conventions i have never seen a convention where there are more people standing throughout the entire speech because they felt this was so historic so special
9009133 one test of a presidential candidates strength and often his best shot at winning is how much he can mould his party in his image and rally it around a powerful argument for his election
9009134 left no doubt of his commitment one that we share to vigorous international engagement the fight against terrorism and the urgency of promoting prosperity in the developing world
9009135 helped himself thursday night but if the polls are right hell need to build his case further during the next nine weeks if he is to become the first black president not just the first black nominee
9009136 thought it was a lost opportunity i was thinking how many times have i heard this same speech over 20 years
9009137 fell short of the expectation he would be workmanlike and very specific about helping the middle class
9009138 the damage on account of floods and rain since the monsoon broke out june 1 was estimated at about rs 2 8 billion
9009139 however we are still keeping our fingers crossed and if the rain god continues to be kind on us perhaps we will be able to tide over the crisis here
9009140 totally against the culture and tradition of hospitality of bengal
9009141 the movement is not at all along the path of gandhian satyagraha initially the trinamool congress leadership promised in a meeting with chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee last week that they would continue their protest in a peaceful manner but that was violated yesterday evening
9009142 after all the foreigners who come to west bengal for professional purposes are our guests yesterdays incident was totally against the culture and tradition of hospitality of bengal
9009143 i think the trinamool supremo has lost control over her party activists and i suggest that the party leadership engage in a dialogue with the state government
9009144 singapore welcomes global talent who can add value to singapore

9009148 the coming of age of indian manufacturing and places indias innovation skills high up on the world map
9009149 it is therefore very unfortunate that the entire project is facing a political situation which it does not warrant
9009150 our position is that we will do everything we can so the druzhba can keep working stably and supply enough oil for european consumers
9009151 it is believed that executives from lead producer lukoil have been put on weekend alert
9009152 told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday
9009153 there are no signs thus far that contracts and approved deliveries will not be adhered to
9009154 in a truly free market youd see visual studio which is an awesome kit that runs under linux bsd and can be bound to other compilers e g intel cc gcc etc in a truly free market youd see office work in linux bsd and use well documented file formats so people could create 3rd party tools for working with the data in a truly free market windows would strive for unix posix compliance underneath so that programs written for it under the gui level would be more portable
9009155 without ridiculous laws against reverse engineering and ridiculous patent laws anyone would be able to dissassemble any file format and then write software to use that format your state prevents you from doing this and entering the market hence prices go up and service goes down dig
9009156 im from europe and the unspoken truth here is that the eu officials are severely corrupt

9009186 sesungguhnya dijadikan sumpah itu hak bagi pendakwa kerana dia merasa lawannya sudah merosakkan haknya dengan penafian itu oleh itu dia boleh meminta lawannya itu bersumpah kerana jika apa yang dia anggap itu betul maka lawannya sudah melakukan dua kerosakan pertama membuat sumpah dusta sebaliknya pula jika apa yang dianggap itu tidak betul maka lawannya itu akan mendapat pahala kerana membuat sumpah secara besar dengan menyebut dan membesarkan nama allah

9009202 this woman has a child that proves that she is what she says she is which is a pro life believer
9009203 shes beautiful to look at the men are going to love her she hunts she fishes she is an environmentalist
9009204 in all honesty i suspect that was one of the reasons that they turned to her
9009205 there are women who are bound and determined not to die before they see a woman in the white house
9009206 has reached beyond traditional republican and washington insiders and identified a first term female governor with an intriguing personal narrative
9009207 this will be an interesting experiment and palin may just attract disgruntled hillary supporters
9009208 it is history and i congratulate sen mccain for choosing a woman
9009209 all i can say is they must be really really worried about barack obamas appeal
9009210 a lot of the women were in favor of hillary clinton because of her stance on issues that are important to women im very proud to be an elected official whos a woman but just having ovaries doesnt qualify you for anything
9009211 sarah palin is an excellent choice for vice president she has a proven track record of making tough choices taking on corruption and implementing reforms in one of our countrys largest states
9009212 as a mother of five with a son in the military she understands firsthand the challenges that american families face like the impact of rising energy prices
9009213 and as governor of a large energy producing state she knows we can and must lessen our dependence on foreign oil through increased exploration and diversification of our energy portfolio
9009214 compared to joe bidens lifelong opposition to energy exploration her energy experience is proof that she is the right choice for this country
9009215 like sen mccain sarah knows the best way to grow our economy is by cutting taxes and controlling spending in washington
9009216 reaffirms sen mccains commitment to energy independence spending restraint and reforming the way washington works
9009217 gov palin supports an all of the above energy approach with first hand experience advocating it
9009218 she has a strong record of working to cut wasteful spending she is firmly dedicated to promoting strong families and protecting the most vulnerable in society gov palin will be a true agent of change who brings a breath of fresh air to washington from far outside the beltway
9009219 i think hillary clintons campaign stimulated a lot of interest among women voters and i think this is going to hit a chord
9009220 thought he needed to satisfy that wing of the party
9009221 i guess the difference is obama is asking to be president while the vice president is a heartbeat away but not exactly president
9009222 more importantly she has the judgment when you look at obamas judgment he has been wrong every single time
9009223 im looking forward to learning about what her record is on foreign policy
9009224 i think its good for republicans and good for the country to have a woman on the ticket
9009225 the vice presidential selection by mccains definition is supposed to be the very best person to be president of the united states after him if he thinks she is the best person thats just stunning its a reflection both on his judgment and on the hypocrisy of his campaign
9009226 look at all the money they spent trying to convince people barack obama doesnt have experience

9009230 siendo estas las bases de la propuesta tal y como ayer explic claramente el vicepresidente econ mico pedro solbes en el congreso de los diputados y que fue criticada por los partidos pol ticos catalanes la delegada del gobierno en extremadura carmen pereira no puede entender la postura del partido popular en la regi n
9009231 el pp con su postura s lo trata como siempre de ensombrecer la labor del gobierno de espa a crear divisi n sombras y crear alarmas innecesarias

9009234 it was a good feeling to see beltre hit that ball
9009235 hes hit in bad luck all year and hit two line drives tonight that were caught
9009236 i tell him around the batting cage all the time how much he means to us the way he keeps getting after it adrian is banged up but hes physically one of the toughest players ive ever seen play the game
9009237 i pitched the eighth and thought j j would be coming in for the ninth
9009238 we have to think about the future about the rest of the year and whats best for j j
9009239 he got up in the ninth and i called out to the bullpen and told him to sit back down
9009240 my wife was having our first child and then there were some complications both for her and our daughter
9009241 its been an up and down ride all year but its been a good roller coaster ride
9009242 we think he could pitch again by saturday or sunday
9009243 then when rosters expand sept 1 we can get him back
9009244 with the giants i asked for my release i didnt see a fit there it wasnt working
9009245 this organization gave me an opportunity to pitch and get to the big leagues which is all i wanted
9009246 kubel has not hit lefties at all this year but he starts against us when we throw a lefty because he hits us so well
9009247 i didnt see the point the eighth inning should belong to sean green and thats the way we went
9009248 i need to show that i can pitch up at this level and go seven innings
9009249 it was a good win for us we needed that win
9009250 perkins had a good outing he just made a couple mistakes the one to ibanez that he left hanging there and then the one to lopez ended up in the seats as well other than that he threw the ball great gave us a great opportunity to win today

9009266 we had some timely hitting some really good hitting today a good game all around
9009267 it was a good team effort offense great defense and roy corcoran coming in and getting through the meat of that order mauer and morneau getting through those guys is a pretty big deal
9009268 it was really tough to get back the runs we gave them and then turn around and give the run back right away well have to come out tomorrow and try to get a win against these guys
9009269 the key terms of the contract allowed the plaintiffs to renew their season tickets with cost certainty and maintain their priority seat numbers these terms are enforceable despite the sonics relocation to oklahoma city based on the foregoing the court should deny defendants motion for summary judgment and enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs

9009271 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term
9009272 he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success mo is a player that excels as a traditional point guard but also brings an extra dimension with his scoring and versatility his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
9009273 this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9009274 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9009275 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9009276 im going to say that its possible but honestly i know better
9009277 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
9009278 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
9009279 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimise human to human infection
9009280 in the meeting of latin american cardiologists we will offer participants the possibility to have their eye tested for early changes of radiation effect that may lead to cataract in future years
9009281 this will allow us to assess retrospectively what radiation dose these cardiologists received and then correlate the data with changes in their lens hopefully this will help them protect themselves better in the future and reduce further radiation in their eyes while maintaining the clinical load
9009282 we started training courses for cardiologists in 2004 and so far cardiologists from more than 50 countries have been trained in radiation protection
9009283 an uncertain revolution why the rise of a genetic model of mental illness has not increased tolerance
9009284 in the case of schizophrenia genetic arguments are associated with fears regarding violence
9009285 in fact attributing schizophrenia to genes is no different from attributing it to bad character either way americans see those with schizophrenia as damaged in some essential way and therefore likely to be violent however when applied to depression genetic arguments have very different connotations they are associated with social acceptance if you imagine that someones depression is a genetic problem the condition seems more real and less blameworthy its in their genes theyre not weak so i should accept them for who they are
9009286 while the stigma surrounding mental illness has not diminished the rate of treatment for psychiatric disorders has increased
9009287 the culture surrounding mental illness has become more treatment focused with direct to consumer advertising of psychiatric medications now a mainstay of popular media
9009288 we are not the first to make dna tubes with controlled circumferences however compared with previous approaches our method is distinctively simple and modular

9009291 obama did better than good he did a very good job he didnt do a great job but he didnt have to the significance of the moment was what mattered i dont care what your political affiliation is or whether you plan to vote for him or not how can that moment not matter to you general consensus was that the speech was great even conservatives that try to paint him as the worst thing that could ever happen to america were impressed even bill kristol thought it was glorious this may be one of the signs of the apocalypse but i agree with pat buchanan pat loved the speech he thought it was great because he thought it was a strong manly speech and the democrats havent had that in a long time theyve had emotional inspiring entertaining and logical speeches but there was no sign of dukakis on that stage last night i saw a man give the audience standing in front of him what they wanted they didnt want to hear about hope they wanted to know he was not going to be john kerry he was not going to let the republicans bash him about the head and neck without fighting back i think he did that he attacked mccain very specifically and deliberately several times and he said come get me im not afraid and i will get you back i guess thats what buchanan meant i thought the bells and whistles afterward was a bit too circus like and he spent too much time on the laundry list but i loved seeing that beautiful black family on the stage and wtf with the b amp in the mccain camp trying to steal the moment with vp speculation foul its like a rod trying to upstage the world series mccain is a better man than that he needs to get his boys under control
9009292 these are my looks whether you like them or not

9009306 i can understand why people go outside the u s you can adopt someone here and the birth parents have three years to come back and get that child thats terrifying
9009307 american children can use just as much assistance as someone from around the world i want to do something here
9009308 are hoping to have a little one by christmas 08
9009309 we have four charity gigs every year and we will still do them but we will not do a record or tour
9009310 even when we play now were not as close as we were i dont miss the getting big or all that stuff i miss when we were real close
9009311 first impressions palins resume is a bit thin too but even so it s a contrasting thinness to obama and to biden consisting of executive experience some of it admittedly lightweight as a springboard for national office such as mayoral service of her hometown of 8 000 palin is a woman and biden may be hampered in getting off a hard hitting attack on her hell have to finesse the attack dog routine which he seems ill suited for while palin does not appear to be the type who pulls punches biden will need to get after her but her status as a woman may give her some cover by forcing him to frame his attacks carefully to avoid charges of sexism mccain has had to fight an uphill battle on the enthusiasm gap but palin as a dark horse candidate and a history making one for the r epublican party may be just what the doctor ordered to inject some energy into the campaign palin does not stomp all over mccains core message of maverick and commitment to reform quite the contrary she reinforces it this in contrast to obama who se pick of biden now looks even more decidedly like a defensive shoring up of his foreign policy chops which actually is okay if it reassures voters more damaging than that though by far is bidens status as a long time washington insider his presence on the ticket does not signal change mccain is looking mavericky with this pick
9009312 mccains core messaging that obama is not ready to lead is an established and solid line of attack that he is continuing to reinforce obama in contrast is off message he has killed his change mantra both by demphasizing it in the message and with the biden pick and his attack messages on mccain are not sharp enough as he leavens them by constantly referencing mccains military service before he levels an attack until now obamas campaign was the sexiest it had more history making more novelty more newness no longer mccain has now given his campaign a woman who appears to be capable of playing the role of attack dog he now has a very good countervailing set of optics to obamas team his team has now become equally as interesting to watch the mccain palin ticket is attractive obama is no longer the most interesting visual in the campaign mccain now has a competing visual given the opticals and messaging attack that mccain is now fielding i think obama biden have a challenge to try to effectively hit these political targets the good news there is that they actually have in their arsenal two smart weapons that could be deployed to devastating effectiveness the bad news those two smart weapons are hillary and bill clinton
9009313 this ticket is attractive as a r epublican i imagine we could do worse i dont think the r epublican leadership of the last eight years deserves another four mccain is trying to convince me that he is going to be different than the rest of his party palin reinforces that message i remain in need of convincing im mindful that when george bush took office george will said it would be government by grownups that s not the way it played out maybe mccain will be different enough but im not convinced yet to take a chance that im not going to get more of the same crap at the same time mccain is successfully sowing doubt and uncertainty as to how much real change i can expect obama to deliver advantage mccain palin is a game changer pick mccain is playing for keeps obama must raise his game again can he do it
9009314 no hay que desconocer la influencia que su gobierno y manera de ver la pol tica latinoamericana ha tenido en nuestros pa ses la del presidente ch vez es una pol tica equivocada de c mo resolver los problemas de latinoam rica

9009318 que tambi n pueden ser democr ticos como el caso de la presidenta de chile michelle bachelet
9009319 el problema radica en que vali ndose del petr leo del poder econ mico se dedique a la compra de voluntades y enga e a los gobiernos hugo ch vez est arrastrando a muchos pa ses a compartir su visi n err tica de una supuesta sociedad m s justa pero en donde no hay libertad solo opresi n

9009321 hoy hemos entregado a la rectora janeth hern ndez el respectivo dep sito por un monto de 232 millones de bol vares este monto es la segunda cuota de la deuda por 930 millones de bol vares es decir que hemos cancelado con esto el 50 por ciento de la deuda que tenemos con el cne en relaci n al apoyo de la deuda que nos aport
9009322 es necesario establecer fiscales electorales en vtv en radio nacional en el teatro nacional que est siendo utilizado como sede del psuv en el teatro teresa carre o que est utilizado como auditorio del psuv sin pagar patrimonio a la naci n y son de todos los venezolanos

9009419 if the storm was heading west or east then companies could just shut down one region of the gulf

9009453 this endeavour has been a huge success far more significant and wide reaching than anyone ever dreamt it could be it has had obvious beneficial effects on the palestinian people but also on israel in fairness credit must go where credit is due despite threats or obstacles a responsible decision was made by israeli authorities not to interfere with our mission and this is a model for the future
9009454 the landing of two wooden boats carrying 46 human rights activists in gaza is an important symbolic victory this non violent initiative of the free gaza movement focused attention around the world on the stark reality that the 1 5 million residents of gaza have endured a punitive siege for more than a year this siege is a form of collective punishment that constitutes a massive violation of article 33 of the fourth geneva convention the siege the coastal blockade and overflights by israeli aircraft all bear witness to the fact that despite israels claimed disengagement in 2005 these realities on the ground establish that gaza remains under israeli occupation and as a result israel remains legally responsible for protecting the human rights of its civilian population by severely restricting the entry of food fuel and medicine the economic and social rights of the people of gaza have been systematically violated there is widespread deafness among the people of gaza that is blamed on the frequent sonic booms produced by over flying israeli military aircraft for this reason the peace boats brought 200 hearing aids to gaza
9009455 above all what is being tested is whether the imaginative engagement of dedicated private citizens can influence the struggle of a beleaguered people for basic human rights and whether their courage and commitment can awaken the conscience of humanity to an unfolding tragedy

9009474 life is a series of problems either you are in one now youre just coming out of one or youre getting ready to go into another one the reason for this is that god is more interested in your character than your comfort he is more interested in making your life holy than he is in making it happy we can be reasonably happy here on this earth but that is not the goal of life the goal is to grow in character in christs likeness

9009653 the marsh is essential to the eco system in our area by monitoring the rise and loss of the marsh soil and comparing it to the rise and fall of the sea level we can determine if the marsh can be saved or lost due to encroachment in this case of the rivers
9009654 if the sea level rises to a point where it the rivers can over run the mash the marsh is considered lost or drowned vegetation is destroyed and the marshes become mud flats

9009663 excellent and one of the better hymn albums youll find millard sounds great as usual bannisters production is typically flawless and the recording is teeming with great musicianship i just hope its not the last because there are too many beloved church standards and too many creative ways to perform them for millard to wrap up a series with so much potential or for that matter to repeat himself musically from one hymned to another
9009664 shuffling through 10 historic gems and one original tune hymned again is a dazzling departure from mercymes more pensive pop rock fare flinging the door wide open for interpretation hymned again brilliantly stylizes its classic catalog with western swing brassy big band finger pickin dixieland simple acoustic and waltzy blues and jazz hymned again is an unusual and oh so wonderful blend of melody music and history that is unfortunately rare in todays capitalistic musical commerce
9009665 the man is like a diamond with more facets than you could ever guess it seems that music runs so deeply into bart millards soul that well have to get several more installments of the hymned series before we can do more than just scratch the surface
9009666 the musical styles on this collection may not appeal to everyone but those who have a fondness for church classics or folk country or blues music will surely enjoy this album warning spontaneous swaying toe tapping or head bobbing likely to occur while being hymned again
9009667 millards vocal versatility shines though as theres not a single moment where you think he shouldnt be tackling a style be it blues bluegrass jazz or balladry hes just that good

9009981 ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto da finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza
9009982 certo che no se fossi allinferno tu non saresti con me
9009983 vuoi per cortesia sforzarti di ascoltare ci che dico mi lasci spiegare quanto sei importante per me
9009984 invece voglio farlo come si deve per favore per favore ricordati che mi hai gi detto di si e non rovinare tutto

9009987 secondo la tradizione tu dovresti sostenere la mia posizione e io la tua
